0,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Literally the most friendly staff I've ever encountered. I don't know everyone's name but it's always pleasant when I come in!
1,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I really want to like this place because I the food is decent and so is the service. However, the wooden tables are shellacked in a cheap coating that creates a sticky feel when hot and management can't (doesn't) get rid of it. It feels pretty gross when your hands touch the table. So instead I order take out and the order is missing items. I think they try hard but they just can't get it together. Perhaps paper tablecloths might work better to make the place more appealing."
2,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Ordered a 12 oz sirloin with garlic mash and steamed broccoli. The broccoli was lightly steamed with absolutely no type of seasoning to it at all. The shed potatoes had absolutely no butter at all. The steak... I ordered it well and I received it not well at all. It was very rubbery and was not tasty at all. Blood was coming out of it so I decided to not eat anymore due to this. I am going to speak with the manager concerning this because this food was awful
3,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"#ShitholeThis place is inefficiently ran. There is NO hostess for the second time. I was here last in middle of January and the same thing. Had to wait and wait and wait. Ridiculous. Finally someone who isn't a host took it upon his hands to figure out seating between the 2 separate customers, including myself.This place is absolutely a shithole. New management needs to come in asap."
4,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Just got back from breakfast with the Easter Bunny. I purchased tickets for $15 bucks online the night before. It was from 9am to 11am. This was the best childrens event i have ever attended. We were seated as soon as we walked in. The Easter walked around the whole time. There was face painting. coloring books, egg hunt and unlimited breakfast food. The staff was fast and polite and the manger walked around and made sure everyone was happy. The buffet had eggs, hash browns, sausage links and patties, french toast, pancakes and bacon. I cant wait for the next event. No lines No crowds they sell a limited amount of tickets! Highly recommend!"
5,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I have been to that branch of Applebee's few times in the past and the service was always bad.The food was ok but nothing really special about it.Last Friday when I came again during the afternoon when the place wasn't busy, I stepped into the restaurant the  staff and the host completely ignored me and were busy talking to each other.I have been waiting for few minutes until a family came into the restaurant and the host gave them his full attention right a way.I have no clue why the host ghosted me but now I know I shouldn't get back to a place who disrespects his clients.Obviously I stepped out right after the incident."
6,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I know it's Sunday and I know you close in a half an hour but the food was terrible. The spinach tasted old and the pasta was over cooked and waitress was rushing to go home. This is the reason I stop coming to big chain restaurants. Never again
7,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"The only thing that saves this place for me is the friendly staff. The food is horrendous here. This is the second time I go here and they bring me a raw steak or burger. I like my meat medium, but apparently the cooks in the back don't know what the hell medium is. My burger was so raw it was trying to eat the lettuce. This place has failed me way too many times. At conception this place was awesome, but like most Applebee's they let themselves go. My party of 10 and I will never eat here again. It's a shame because their staff was awesome, but someone needs to fire that cook."
8,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This is by far the slowest Applebees ever..Ordered appetizers for kids simple Mozzarella sticks took 20 mins my Cesar salad took just as long..entrees well I had to remind waitress and also speak with Manager about my order now we are about 45 mins sitting with no refill on drinks or even an acknowledgement..when entrees finally arrive it was unsatisfying, food was not hot and plated as if they rushed (makes you think would the cook or wait staff eat this stuff?) Very disappointed"
9,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I went to Applebees with my wife last Saturday at 12pm on August 24th. From the moment we sat down I knew we should have exited the place. Before I start talking about the recent experience we had, I want to say that up until a year ago the Applebees in Throggs Neck was clean and the service was good. Well things sure have changed. I should have realized that the place at 12pm on a Saturday should have been at least 1/3 occupied. At the time only two other customers were in it. Sitting down I noted the table was extremely sticky. A total turn off. I kindly asked our waitress if she could wipe the table down. Her response was all the tables are like that and she couldn't do anything about it. Ok  I said to myself. I didn't want to upset my wife so I tried to make the best of it.  Going through the menu, I was happy to see that they had Sam Adam's Oktoberfest clearly featured. I requested that. She then asked if we were ready to order. I asked for a steak sandwich which the waitress abruptly asked me where I saw that on the menu. I politely answered that I took that as a giving. I then requested the Bourbon  steak and a hero roll to make a sandwich myself. She replied that we cannot do that, I said ok, give me the bourbon steak with Fries. She said she couldn't do that and I would only get red potatoes. I then said, just give me a cheeseburger and fries. At this point it was about the cold Oktoberfest beer I was waiting on. She came back to the table and said they don't have Sam Adams Oktoberfest and only some Summer ale that I don't like. I then said to my wife lets go. I will never return to Applebees again. So sad what happened to this place."
10,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Well I ordered the salmon and rack of ribs with baked potato, the salmon was ok little over cooked and the ribs were dry, and crunchy not good. I was skeptical to send it back so I just ate it. Never again.it was not that packed but they took a while to bring food. And it was freezing in here. Server was nice."
11,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I'm so very disappointed every time I order the same dish, it comes out different, it tastes different every time and it's very disappointing.   On top of tasting different it's always missing something lacking flavor I don't know if they have a huge turn around in the kitchen but it is very disappointing.   This used to be my go to place and I don't know if it will be again.  The girls are so friendly and service is good with the girls but the food is lackluster.  I'm even sorry for posting this review but that's how upset I am.   My husband ordered the whiskey burger and even that tasted different.  I don't know what's going on."
12,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,We stopped by today before shopping and we were very pleased. A nice gentleman greater is at the door and walked us to a table immediately. A nice young lady (Laud) took out order and was very sweet. She brought us our beverages and later on brought us our meal. She came by our table a few times to see if everything was alright. I was very pleased with the food and the surroundings. We will be coming back frequently. Even as we left the same gentleman that greeted us at the door came to the door to ask us if everything was fine. It's so nice to be treated in such a kind manner. Thank you so much.
13,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Probably the worst Applebee's I've ever been too, and I NEVER go to Applebee's because everything sucks! The food, the drinks it's all crap! I went today with my grandma and we waited almost an hour for shrimp and fries. Out waitress never asked us how the food was or if we wanted another refill on our beverages. She came over to us and just dropped the bill off, didn't ask if we wanted more food, or anything. I then asked for food to go, and it took almost 40 minutes for our to go food. Then, after I asked about where's the food she hands us the food and says they ran out of fries so they gave us mash. We were never asked if we wanted something else, they just gave us mash. Then, the shrimps we ordered to go, only had six where, the shrimp I ate at the restaurant had about 10-12. I will never go back here! Customer service sucks! Food sucks!!"
14,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I came into Applebee's after we saw a commercial with some new menu items they have. We went in today around 3:30 and it was definitely a bit crowded for a Tuesday afternoon. Our waitress Caitlyn was a sweetheart she was super attentive. Now the food on the other hand was Terrible!!! When the waitress brought our food out I couldn't even eat due to it looking completely different from what the menu shows. I only gave it 2 stars due to our waitress was great.
15,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I wish I could give no stars  I had went on Saturday night 1/12/19.  Food took forever to come. I ordered my burger well done. Suffered bad indigestion after eating. Woke up the next morning with food poisoning  DO NOT EAT HERE
16,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Today was the second coming to this apple bee's the first time wasnt a good experience the waiter  didnt bring us plates or our drinks we had to ask for them mean while the next table  she was attending after us  got they're stuff  immediately but  we gave it another shot this time the waiter was a sweet heart she introduce her self her name was Dorothy she checked up on us to see if everything was okay  she even asked if i wanted a refill her customer care service was 10/10 10 golden stars im only giving this a 4 cause of our first experience .
17,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This spot is low key , clean , serves pretty good on point drinks a lot better then coop city spot"
18,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,The food and service is always great but there's always a long line. Be prepared to wait at least 30 mins. But after your seated food comes out fast and the drinks are strong. The 2 for $20 is my go too.
19,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Overall good service. The staff was attentive. My only issue is that my steak was medium rare rather than medium. Better than most Applebee's in the Bronx.
20,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Ok, I gave this place a chance actually a few chances the last 4 visits have not been very pleasant. Twice we were unable to be seated promptly because the tables are broken, the last visit prior to today a fight broke out and the staff was unable to properly handle it, picture this: as soon as we walked up to the receptionist we were informed they needed a few minutes to ensure people's safety  now talk about inviting. Needless to say we turned around and ran out the door. Today was the last straw.... we walk in 15 minutes to 9 pm and ask for a table. The guy says we can sit next to the bar and I explained (because apparently he couldn't see) that I had a child with me and I'd rather sit in one of the many empty tables by the window to which he responded that they weren't sitting anyone there ‍‍‍‍ no reason they just weren't. And here we are today me leaving this location hungry/unsatisfied and or unhappy. Way to go Applebee's for another satisfied customer. Management, you really have to do something at this rate you will go out of business. Might as well turn the place into a bar stop serving food and only furnish the place with stools being that the tables seem to be disposable here."
21,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I live close by so I have been to this location a few times (because it's convenient). I have refrained from giving a review because the first few times I would have given a rating of 1-2 stars and I have really wanted to give this place a chance.... The wait staff has forgotten to bring food/drinks/utensils/the bill, and this is when they have showed up to the table at all. I thought at times the wait staff thought the patrons visited this place for the seats and the TVs. That being said, last night my visit was surprisingly extremely pleasant. I am doing a ten day detox which has many dietary restrictions (today is my last day whooohooo) needless to say what I can eat wasn't on the menu. When the waitress came I gave her a long, specific list of what I wanted and what I didn't want on my salad. My mother and daughter ordered from the menu. The manager came by to ask how I preferred the peppers. Once the food was ready it was brought to our table and all in a very timely manner, honestly based on past experience I was shocked the food came quickly. The manager brought the salad himself indicating it had all fresh items (I politely thanked him and smiled but doubted the statement) when I started eating I had no doubt that the items were fresh the onions had a kick to them, the tomato was great everything on my salad was perfect. Both my mom and daughter enjoyed their food also, there were no complaints. The waitress had forgotten the forks but she realized immediately and didn't give us a chance to ask for them so I won't count that against her. All in all it was a very surprisingly pleasant experience. The time prior to yesterday that I was there (a few days ago) I had ordered salad and it was brought out with frozen tomatoes but the waitress then was great also she must have been watching the table because as soon as I put one in my mouth (God knows what facial expression I must have had) she came over and asked if everything was ok, took back the salad and gave me a new one with tomatoes that were not frozen. Again the salad I had yesterday was awesome. I'll probably be back to have the shiraishi shrimp once I'm done with my detox, they are pretty good if you don't mind a little spice.I'm giving them 5 stars based on my recent experience they have done a 180 from the time they opened the customer service has improved significantly and the food is tasting the way it should.They had a rough start but they are definitely getting the hang of it."
22,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Of the ""chain restaurants"" in our neighborhood I am partial to the overall dining experience of Applebee's. Especially after today's visit where ""southern hospitality"" is thriving in the North! I hadn't been served yet but was over whelmed by the hospitality of this staff! Chuck the  manager greeted us at the door with such a warm welcome! He was hands on all over the dining room and has such a great personality! Our waitress Dominique is such a doll and very, very knowledgeable about the menu! She is the type of server that should train other staff  in the etiquette of serving! And of course this atmosphere comes from the general manager, Jamie, who sets the tone with his professional yet warm demeanor. The food we ordered today came quickly and was great! We ordered from both the lunch menu and the new ""create your own"" combos for $19.99. First we started with the Tomato Basil soup that is always a favorite! Lots of options with each but with my lunch combo menu I choose the classic and signature combo for $9.99. I had an exceptional southwestern steak and black bean soup that was chock full of a lot of tender steak meat, black beans topped with cheese, tortilla strips and diced fresh tomato salsa in a spicy amazing soup! The other half was a nice sized southwestern chicken salad with perfectly grilled sliced chicken breast and a nice lime cilantro dressing! We ordered from the $19.99 combo menu the 6oz Sirloin and the half rack double glazed baby back ribs that both were seared and seasoned perfectly with two sides of creamy garlic mash and roast potatoes! One day we will get to their desserts but with the big portions they serve, we never have room! Next time dessert first! Be on the look out for surprise specials this spring!"
23,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Had a quickie lunch at the Applebee's in the new Lafayette shopping mall in the Bronx. We ordered an array of apps. The Kobe style meatballs were good. The Salsa verde nachos were good but could have had a tad more cheese and meat on them. Double crunch bone in wingsClassic was also very good. I have to say you really get a lot for your money at Applebee's, the portions were larger than I expected!Our entrees were Three cheese chicken penne which is always a winner and Double glaze baby back ribs which were literally finger licking good!The Fiesta chicken chopped saladIs always a nice light alternative that does not feel like your eating lighter!! And the Chicken tortilla soup was very hearty, spicy but could have been more satisfying with more of the chicken meat.  Service was great with our server Elizabeth who was very perky, nice and eager to please! But the real star of this Applebee's is the manager Jamie. The whole time we were there, he was everywhere and with a warm smile. From greeting all the tables, to checking the drinks to even clearing tables, he made this restaurant run smoothly. When you have a good manager, it trickled down to your staff! He sets the tone for the whole restaurant!"
24,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"We have all been to an Applebee's restaurant and pretty much know what to expect. BUT... I was very, very impressed by the ""trial run"" soft opening that was bopping with people tonight!First, shout outs for an amazing staff but especially a very personable Danika, our sweet and knowledgable waitress Katherlyn, an old friend and manager Nicole and General manager Jamie Podojil who ran the show with a cool, upbeat vibe! The whole staff were excited, pumped and willing to please! Enough about the staff already we came to eat and eat well we did! Here's the run down in a nutshell...Frozen drinks were delicious and perfectly made! App of the Chicken Quesadilla Grande was exploding with big chunks of Chipotle Chicken, melted cheese, crisp bacon in huge tortillas!!My Fiesta Chicken Chopped salad was delectably spicy with a jalapeño dressing drizzled over black beans, corn, roasted peppers and onions, lettuce, white cheddar, tortilla strips and excellent chimichurri glazed grilled chicken which made this Tasty Lady muy caliente! Bueno!!My partners had the three cheese chicken penne with fresh basil, creamy Alfredo sauce, bruschetta with a mound of perfectly grilled chicken atop! A classic Turkey breast sandwich was served in a freshly toasted ciabatta roll with smoky mayo that was simple yet done divinely!And last but not least the lunch combo of oriental chicken salad with fried chicken, oriental greens, almonds tossed in a off the flavor charts oriental vinaigrette  and Honey pepper chicken tenders that were seasoned and prepared flawlessly! Now dessert... ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!  We had no room for dessert with the large portions served, that will have to wait for another visit! I don't know if this place had beginners luck or cast a magic spell on us, but we will be returning again, and again and well you get the idea!  Great job Applebee's, all your restaurants should run this smoothly and deliciously!"
25,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"There's a new Applebee's in town at 815 Hutchinson River Pkwy, next to the new Target and they are giving free food out tonight! We tried the pretzels with cheese dip, chili, French onion soup, tomato basil soup, chicken tortilla soup, the ultimate trio, we picked the pretzels with cheese dip, wings, honey BBQ chicken and we also ordered the sliders with a side of mash. Everything was great and the staff was super friendly!"
26,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I ordered the all you can eat special which consisted of one of three entrees: chicken fingers and fries; shrimp and fries; or rib tips and fries. I started out with the rib tips which were okay then went to the shrimp and fries. The shrimp were soft to the touch which meant they weren't good. Also they were tiny and fried in old grease cause the outside of the shrimp was dark brown in color. So I sent them back. Then I ordered the chicken fingers. They were lukewarm. Okay. But nothing to write home about. Needless to say I will not order that again and will think twice before going back to this particular Applebee's.
27,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I just want to start off by saying this is one of the best Applebees I enjoy dining in when the right people are working. I am a regular here at throggs neck and I always ask for Dennise. Her name should be speedy because she works fast with the sense of urgency she is hands down one of best waitresses there and perhaps the only one that seems to care a lot for her guests and her co-workers. I've seen good days and bad days here but honestly it comes down to the work environment. Structure needs to be addressed. I've been in many Applebees and I realized a few things on my visits here this place lacks apple buddy system there is no flow everyone is all over the place I am flabbergasted that no one wears headsets anymore which is probably why things get haywire and there seems to be no communication between the foh Or the boh.  Overerall this place needs better staff and management.
28,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This Applebee's is almost as bad as the one on 125st in Harlem that's close now, this would be the seventh time coming here & only twice they got my order right, I know it sounds like Iam a sucker for bad service, but it's not that, it's in my neighborhood & I would to see it do good.....Applebee's upper management help!!!!!!"
29,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"POOR...I had a worst experience at this store. The waitress was so unprofessional. She took s long time to take our orders. Our drinks sat at the bar for at least 10 minutes, that I asked the manager that was walking by if he could ask someone to bring them over. He ended up bringing them himself. The food can out cold. Finally, when it was time for us to pay our bill the waitress list my debit card. Never came over to tell us what was happening and we sat and waited for 30  plus minutes. Card never was returned to me. The manager was very useless and did not take action like a manager should. They were Ll looking for my card and didn't even let me know what was taking so long. The funny thing is that the waitress looked overwhelmed with only 2 tables and one of them was mine a party of 2. Very incompetent. Will never go there again."
30,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,This place is the worst no water no menus waited 35 min for a drink -the waiter is preoccupied with settling checks . Table dirty this place is the worst
31,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"My family and I came to Applebee's for dinner. Each one of our orders was bad. Cold or undercooked. Ordered a baked potato and it was hard as a rock. Chicken was cold. Even my iced tea had a strange taste. $70 dinner, left hungry. Will never come here again."
32,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Very long wait & it was no where near busy. Waited 20 min for a waitress to take our order and that's only because I asked for a waitress.
33,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Today, March 19, 2018, I went to the Throggs Neck Applebee's to celebrate lunch with my family. I would like to add we frequent this location often but during peak hours. The waitress, Lousita ""Lucy,"" barely came to the table. Half the orders were cooked well but the other half were not. The chicken was undercooked for dishes and then replaced; however, the replacements were not seasoned. Because we couldn't access Lucy, we asked the host to bring a manager. He had an attitude but said he'd let the manager know. After 45 minutes of waiting (oh and Lucy didn't come back to the table), we noticed the manager Jose Valdez assisting another table. My husband had to get up and ask Mr. Valdez to return to the table to discuss the poor service and poor food quality preparation. Mr. Valdez failed to make eye contact. Then came with a compensated receipt that wasn't even the correct items purchased. So the receipt was not adequately compensated and the complaint was not addressed. We paid the bill because we simply could not waste anymore time in the restaurant. We will be contacting corporate and the franchise owner with a detailed complaint and copies of the different receipts. This complaint was written to advise potential patrons to visit during peak hours when the restaurant has it's A-team on staff or to go to the Applebee's in the Hutchinson Metro Center. It always exemplifies professionalism and courtesy."
34,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I'm not a fan of chain restaurants but on a whim I came to Applebee's and I must admit it was yummy. Ok the service is not the best but I did get my food quickly and the bar keep was on her game. I'm a convert.
35,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Went for breakfast this morning and broughtvxvnxmmnz our family 8 people total. Our waitress was absolutely the sweetest person and certainly tried her best to provide the best service possible under the circumstances. We have been to this Applebee's on 3 other occasions and the service and food was good. Today was something completely worse. We waited over an hour to be served our breakfast. Our waitress was the only waitress for the whole restaurant plus the hostess. We watched other tables getting served as we continued he to wait. Our waitress kept apologizing and eventually brought us a plate of fries due to our 2 year old was screaming for food for 20 mins. At this point our waitress had gone into the kitchen to help get the food out. While she was in there a group of military personnel came in with a party of 10 people. They waited to be seated and even approached the kitchen doorway to call back for help but with the waitress being all alone in the front and having to help in the back the group got tired of waiting and eventually walked out. At this time we still had not received our food and began to watch 6 other employees strolling in before 12pm. Clearly only there for a paycheck and not a team player and didn't care about their fellow employee running around like crazy. They sat ate breakfast, drank coffee, walked around talking to each other and sat on their phones for a good 30 mins. Not once did they pay attention to the waitress that was the only one working. The one gentleman came in and sat down in a hoodie watching everything going on and didn't even approach the group of 10 military people that had walked in. He watched them standing at the front, placing tables together on their own and saw them at the kitchen door yelling to the back. He never got up to let them know someone would be there to help them or try and seat them. He watched them walk right out the door. Finally we received our food and not one of the orders were okay. The food was disgusting!! Watery eggs, over cooked steak dried out, burnt food, missing items we ordered,  jalapeños in food that someone can't consume due medical reasons!! This place was SEVERELY under staffed and our poor waitress suffered the whole morning into the afternoon which we can say cause we waited from 10:30 on to get food!! I feel bad for our waitress that a manager would allow a place to be run that way and sorry for her that her own coworkers would literally just sit and watch the chaos she was stuck in and not even care enough to get up from their group table in the back of the restaurant!!! So sad we will unfortunately never return to Applebee's for breakfast and looks like we are going back to family breakfast somewhere else!!"
36,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,My daughter has a food allergy everything that continues beef products and ingredients. So the manager Jamie  Podojil made  her food himself and she said it was delicious yummy shrimp and baked potato. I will keep coming to this restaurant every single time bc they are very attentive.

38,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Don't get me wrong the three stars are more because of the food which was by far so nasty I couldn't finish my steak. I ate my mashed potatoes and broccoli instead. But the service was on point. I know it's not their fault for the food but we did go to eat not to see the servers. The lady who took care of us was super attentive and saw to it to make our experience better. The icing on the cake was the manager who discounted it from the check. Major plus. If the food improves we might go back because of the service but right now definitely not the food.
39,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Omg. I love this place. Staff is always on point with my orders and I have never had a problem with my food. I love how nice and genuine Denise is always when welcoming. From there I make my way to the bar and LET ME TELL YOU!!! Elizabeth makes the BEST drinks. I love her and she knows how to treat customers. Again. This is the best apple bees ive ever been too. Food is great, service is amazing and never had a bad experience I recommend coming here. Especially with the family. Another thing I love. Is NEVER having to wait 10 years for the food. It comes out in 5 mins"
40,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Should have no stars. Service is terrible food is terrible. Waiter lied to us and ignored his tables. Really bad experience trust me go to one of the other food places in the shopping center.
41,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I came with my family for dinner and they didn't even have silverware like wtf ? I tried to avoid all the other locations in the bronx and i came here thinking it was going to be a great experience ?? Shittiest place yet...they have us plastic silverware for steak !!!! Don't come here. Then what we ordered came and we all got different orders that WE DID NOT ORDER. My chicken was then burned and i said i can't eat this. This whole place is bad, people just don't seem to want to work here. Luckily our waiter was nice. DO NOT COME HERE"
42,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Came to eat here for a party of four.Got a seat really quick so that's a plus. Waitress came relatively quick and took our orders. Appetizers came in a few minutes but the entree is where the real delay occurred.Waited approximately 45 minutes for the food. And of course when it came the food was burnt / dry. We had tilapia and steak. Not the easiest dishes to cook but still. Manager was nice enough to sort new dishes for us, so that's what gives this place that extra star. Expected more from this place. Looks like many customers have a problem with their wait times. Hopefully they read these reviews and decide to get it together."
43,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Today is Veterans Day. I went to this establishment with my parents this afternoon. The wonderful treatment of our veterans is very much appreciated by my family and neighbors. The food was great as well as the service. Never Forget and Thank everyone for their service.
44,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Honestly, if I could give a zero I would. I've come here twice and both times the wait time to even have someone come take our order was ridiculous!! Second time we had to actually go find someone to take our order!!! A manager came and took the order. The place was not even crowded. The doos comes out room temperature too. If people would stop hanging out and actually do their job the place would actually be manageable. Won't be going back. WILL tell people how awful this place is."
45,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I wish I could like this place more. I like that they have a good variety of kids meals and unlimited soda. But the overall environment is really loud so we feel really anxious with family children and baby and having to basically talk very loud to hear each other over the loud ambiance music and overall loud atmosphere, since everyone is pretty much talking loud too cause of the loud music. Every time we go there our orders take really long (we're 2 adults and 2 children 6 and 10 and a baby that doesn't really count). We've seen people coming after us and getting their orders first. Now I know larger orders take longer, but when you're dealing with hungry children and a baby that can wake up and/or get real cranky and ruin the whole lunch/dinner and you can't even have one of their nice drinks because we're driving and parenting. It really sucks that your orders take that long. I really love the half lettuce salad and the ribs are delicious. I keep coming back because I love the food, but it's always a tense experience with all that was stated above. The staff is alright, I was just disappointed that last time we went there with the baby the waitress didn't know how to secure the baby car seat to their high chair and she didn't make much of an effort. So we were left cracking our brains alone trying to figure out how to secure the chair. Eventually we got it right but it was definitely a frustrating situation."
46,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I am writing about food.The place at 1h30 pm was kind of empty.I and my wife order 2 for 26.00.The chicken taco was good.I did order steak with fries& veg.She order three cheese pasta with chicken .without kidding. .the steak like rubber..you can chew it like gum..I will be afraid to feed it to my dog as he may not chewing it and end up suffocated. My wife.s dish was edible, but nothing special.Service was good.The meat/steak  that they used is really the lowest grade you can get ....Having decent quality meat end up bringing more return customer,  otherwise no body should risk loosing teeth because you decide to save money and buying rubber cuts."
47,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Like always the food and service was great.This time I ordered the cedar grilled lemon chicken. It came with rice that tasted like it was boiled in dish water.
48,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I went to eat today with my wife and daughter. Greeter tells me as soon as I walk in that both chef called out and not enough servers. He also tells me you can sit here if you want but food going to be long. If you have no chef working why did you open?
49,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Always feel great about this place staff are super nice and pleasant  to work with.This is my favorite spot for lunch since they have tons of parking .
50,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"About a month or so ago, I decided to dine at Applebee's for breakfast with my family.  Upon arrival my older son had an epic meltdown - WWIII style. He is on the spectrum.  My MIL and I tried to calm him down and the manager Jamie came by to check on us. I was totally embarrassed as my son doesn't have frequent meltdowns of this epic proportion.  We finally got my son to calm down and sit at the table. I went to the restroom to compose myself (meaning cry and get it out of my system). Upon leaving the bathroom Jamie was with his team doing their morning meeting. I passed by and apologize for what happened and he was just so kind, sweet and understanding - I wanted to cry again but this time because he was so caring. Usually parents of children with special needs just get looks from people instead of offering help.  I just want to take a moment to do this review because of the importance of acceptance and tolerance of people with special needs.  Thank you Jamie and your staff for making us feel welcomed. You went out of your way to make our dining experience as stress free as possible.  We went back a week later and Jamie personally attended to us. My son was calm and placed his order. Jamie came back making sure we were all taken care of.  Can't thank you enough.  You're a #1 Manager in our book!"
51,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I took a seat at the bar. It took the  young lady 12 minutes to come over to me. Only two people at the bar at the time. I order a stella ...no stella...I order a Corona regular ...no corona regular . Smh. I then order a blue moon...no orange...smh again. She's busy talking to her coworkers. It took her  over  20  minutes to come over and take my order. I ask her if then going to replace the empty keg of Stella. It took her 25 minutes to come over to me. Just to tell me no...so I order water...The place wasn't busy at the time. Last time I come to Apple bees...some of these servers forget to focus on the customers.
52,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This was the worst restaurant experience ever. I brought my poor father for his birthday, and the service was horrible. First, we walk in and waited around 20 minutes for a table. During these 20 minutes a family, who came in after us, was seated before us. Eventually, we got our table, without utensils or napkins. After waiting a whole hour and a half we finally get our food, cold. My father deserved better. The staff was nowhere to be found, and workers were walking around doing nothing. -1/10 would not recommend going to this Applebee's."
53,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Just bad. Musta been on a bad night. Idk. Idc...it was 9 pm I was hungry. Went there to get something fast but nope...Had to wait 10 mins to be seated when half the place was empty.. Waited another 10 mins and no server came by. No greeting from anyone. No body asking us for drinks n etc.. The typical...I looked around and don't see a single server. So I figured they must be pressing the automated system. So I order food and waters.on this crap device. The salad came out. I asked the guy who brought it to us if our waters were on the way before I can ask him about utensils. Dude bolts out...He leaves and comes back. I ask him if we can get something to eat this salad with. Leaves. Comes back with them. Later I ask someone  for more napkins. He tells me ""to wait till I see my server as ask him"" I asked him who is my server. All I had was some guy with his hat on backwards bring me a salad that I had to order thru this iPad wanna be.. He reluctantly hands me a stack of napkins...what a dick. He cuda given them to me the whole time but wanted me to wait for this mythological server whom I've never seen???? So....it gets better trust me... I then realize where all the servers are. They are all tending to a large party of 10-12 ppl. Like 5 servers all bringing out food and drinks and more food n etc. It's so bad that other people are now walking out... So I did the same after waiting 20 mins and seeing the staff/bartender/cooks/ & dishwashertend to this ""huge"" party.. Thanks. I'll never go to an Applebee's ever again."
54,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Nothing like a loud horn, flashing lights, and unapologetic waitstaff to drive a good review down the drain. Our whole meal was overshadowed by fire lights. Reassurances from the waitstaff that it would subside were essentially false."
55,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"11/24/2017        Went here for drinks and appetizers, drinks and service was not bad, the BAD part was when the food came so did a roach!!! The manager came over and apologized saying this was because of the pet store next door. If they know about this problem they should try and address it !!!"
56,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Most likely you've been to an Applebee's so you already know their food & prices . This location is probably the best one in the Bronx. The food was about the same as anywhere else nothing bad to say about it. The service was good & I didn't have to wait too long to be seated or get my food. A good place to go to if you like Applebee's but I'm not crazy about their prices or their menu
57,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"ok so ive been here two times before so i came back today... it was bad from the start first it took 20 mins for the bar tender to even say hi (the location wasn't busy) then he took our drink orders and disappeared for another 10min till i seen him walking by and told him we wanted to order  food then had us wait cuz he was going to make our drinks ,  it took about 25 min for the food to come and everything was cold . even better they burned  the taco shells  .. i font understand why the manger snd all the wokers just stood around talking most of the time ... and im allergic to oranges and the bar tender put it in my drink any way (he say i thought you ment don't put orange juice and an orange in it ) it was a sangria pitcher i didn't see it till after i drank a cup of it !!!!!!!never coming back again"
58,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This place is complete trashI live in the area and I have come here numerous times and I must say every time I come it's just complete garbage I go in and get seated pretty fast but that's pretty much the only good thing about this place, and the waitress/waiters or ok, but then the drinks are trash, the food is complete trash, and don't even get me started on the wait time for the food. On top of that the employees that work there seem like they don't even care about their jobs or good service. It's like they just go in, read a script and collect and check and go home. One time I went in and I order some food and some drinks. My bill comes out to $125 dollars and I'm looking around surprised cause I wasn't sure what I order that was so much. Come to find out that the waiter I had forgot to close out the bill to his other table so it was all added together in my bill. Yea nice try buddy. One of my last bad experience was that I went in and sat at the bar, waited 20 mins for a bartender to serve me, there was 2 employees a couple of feet away from me just chatting away about who had more Instagram like, and completely ignored me. So I politely got up and walked out. On my way out I told the hostess they took too long to serve meIn conclusion this place HORIBBLE, all in caps and complete trash."
59,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Demsond , was a wonderful  as manager he assisted me when I really was looking to have a good breakfast thank you  Jennifer was my waitress thank you Jennifer."
60,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"My family and I stopped by this establishment for my dads birthday lunch. The hostess was polite, server awesome and the manager kept checking to make sure we were okay the entire time we were there. Our food and drinks came out in a timely manner and everyone was happy. This is a completely different experience from the one I had at the Applebees in New Roc City. I will definitely come back here as it is clean and the people most of all were polite....something I haven't seen much of since coming to NY:)"
61,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Hospitality SMELLS  before you enter AppleBees at Throgsneck BX,NY:) -And It continues inside which pairs  with tasty, quality FOOD! Our waiter, Abby, was a menu of great service:) We will be regulars here for sure!"
62,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"What a GREAT idea to open this new location I don't have to drive is close to my house, the staff is very friendly and professional, the food is nice and fresh...I will definitely will be coming back.Thank you Jamie!"
63,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I went there today and the service was great. Love how the manager ask if we were ok with a smile. Atmosphere was extremely nice.
64,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Love this place. On and off to 678 Throggs Neck Bridge, Bruckner Expressway, and the Cross Bronx Expressway. Clean, fresh food, happy hour, plenty of seating, free wi-fi. The happy hour consists of half price apps and $3 drafts and $4 drinks. Try their berry sangria!!! Wow, it's good."
65,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"For my first time here, I am highly satisfied to see quality customer service at Applebee's because of Julissa & Max. I've been to many locations across bed-stuy Brooklyn, Queens, times sq Manhattan & parkchester Bronx but this is a first for me. I came for happy hour which is only at the bar; Since the bar was full I was ready to leave but a greeter promptly sat me at a table & I quickly over ordered to show my appreciation. The large screen TV showing any game of choice is really exciting.  Mega Props to Supervisor Max for engaging customers. For a busy Friday night I really felt like I was the most important customer in the dining room. Remember to #tip."
66,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I've been here twice for happy hour. I was treated both times really well. At first I was worried that we would have a long wait for a happy hour table on a Friday. However both times it was under 10 minutes.  The service was great and my server was very friendly and sweet. For happy hour they half half priced appetizers and drink specials. I would definitely go again.
67,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This has to be the worst Applebee's I have EVER been too. The service is horrible!!! I was not greeted at the door upon entering, waited 10 mins to be greeted by hostess after numerous of employees walked past. I sat down and at the bar another 20 mins to get at least someone's attention. I ordered a Samuel Adams and the beer was not cold it was warm. Beer is not supposed to be served over 39 degrees. Bar tenders are eating behind the bar, covering it up with a napkin. This is not my first visit here. Been here a couple of times before and the service was horrible every single time.Customer Service is not rocket science."
68,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"It's just ok !!ive been to few different applebees never impressed so I was not expecting to be wowed,like the rest as long as you order a simple burger or a salad you'll be ok,I will say make sure you tell them to give you freshly cooked fries,when they get busy I've been giving stale fries!!!stay away from soups they suck!!!"
69,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Lets get straight to the point on this one...Today I came to this location for a simple dinner..Upon entering this location, I waited in front of 4 workers for a period of 4 minutes before they noticed to take my name for the waiting list...I waited approximately 30 minutes before I was seated..After ordering I was told they were out of ribs and shrimp...A bit irresponsible of the management to notify their customers after a long wait...Decided to just stick it out because I don't have time to be running all over the place...lastly, I ordered a top-shelf margarita which was totally different the second time I ordered..Simply this place lacks organization, consistency, and common sense...Surely will not be eating here again...Hope management starts overlooking things here..This place SUCKS..."
70,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Let me start by saying all franchises are NOT created equal.  I arrived to this location about 7pm this evening (Saturday) and needed to get this review submitted as quickly and accurately as possible.  It was a party of 9 (5 Adults / 4 Children).  We ordered our apps and drinks which both arrived pretty quickly.Just a quick note, I ordered a bunch of apps at the beginning and then considered ordering from the 2 for $26 menu which includes one of three select appetizers; one of the which was part of my original  app order (Queso Dip). I asked if the original app could be included as part of the 2 for $26 and the manager's response was the size of the apps are different.  Apparently, the app that's part of the 2 for 26 combo has less chips and a smaller dip.  No Problem!When it came time to ordering entrees the waitress was definitely doing her part in plugging cocktail specials for us to try.  She convinced me to get a Fireball Sangria and Merry mojito ....after all, tis the season.  Wasn't crazy about either of them though.We ordered the following entrees:- Two steak entrees- Three kids chicken tenders- Chicken Caesar Salad- One Pasta Dish- Two BurgersIt took about 25 mins for 4 entrees to make it out.  Surprisingly, it was the entrees one would think takes the longest to prepare.  After half the table received their meals and were finishing up,  we were approached a few times asking if the rest of the food came out....a question that should probably be directed to the kitchen.  The table was half empty and what infuriated me was half the missing entrees belonged to my 2 year old (who fell asleep) and 8 year old.  They ordered chicken fingers and fries.....how long can that possibly take?By the time the remaining entrees came out...I lost my appetite, my daughter fell asleep, and nephew had three overcooked tenders to add to his dining experience.In this particular situation,  the ""back"" of the restaurant  was ultimately the culprit but the front could have done their due diligence to troubleshoot and investigate what the issues were in the kitchen.  This isn't a blame game but our waitress thought of everything to say to keep us at ease.  When she brought my food out, she told me that the original dish I was supposed to receive didn't ""look"" good so she didnt want to serve it to me....translation,  she was grasping for straws because there was no more room for excuses.I asked to speak to the manager and it took a while for him to address the matter and although I appreciate some of the ""comps"" they in no way make up for this type of experience. I would have been more than happy to pay full price for a nice evening with my family.  This dining experience was an epic FAIL but a learning opportunity for their entire staff in the front and back of the house.  I think this location may have been a bit premature in opening without providing sufficient training to their staff.  I'll give this place another chance in the next several months and look forward to drafting a much more positive critique when I revisit."
71,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I want to start off by saying this is the worst Applebee's I have been to and I will not be going to this Applebee's anymore. The reason being is because I have been going to this Applebee's for about 3 years and the first time I went it was welcoming but after that it went all downhill. Every time after I felt that the servers were very rude and most times forget about their customers. I use to go there with my girlfriend and we use to always be treat very rude and sometimes we will be forgotten upon being seated. One time we waited for almost 40 minutes before a server came to us. It took for us to get up and call for a manager so that we could be seen. Today I call it quits with this one because I called 3 times so that I can place a pickup order but all three times I was put on hold by an employee and no one ever came to the phone. So I then decided to go to this Applebee's to order at the bar. The bartender then came to me and ask if I was placing an order and I stated yes. The bartender told me to hold on and then left before I placed my order. I was standing up for about 20 minutes and she didn't show up to take my order. So that's when I decided to leave. The only reason why I wanted to do an order to go was because I hated to dine in there because of the traumatic experiences I had. Today was my final straw and I will no longer be returning to this establishment again.
72,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Throggs Neck Shopping Center, 815 Hutchinson River Pkwy, Throggs Neck, NY 10465Jennifer the waitress is spot on with professionalism! The food tastes better and the drinks drink better! This Applebee's is a favorite putting the others  in the Bronx, to shame! The service is great, the food is preparred perfectly,  not too salty and always hot !"
73,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Bad service never again, We waited 45 minutes to get drinks and 30 minutes additional to get appetizer! To be only told waiter didn't like the way appetizer looked, So she made chef do it again? Yea okay! We walked out Went to co-op location and was served both appitizer and meal in 20 mintues!"
74,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Came here for dinner last night. When we walked in it was packed but we were able to get a table pretty right away. It took almost an hour for us to get our one app. Then when our meals came nobody bothered taking all of the plates from the apps and we had no room to eat. On top of that the waitress didn't know what Oktoberfest or Sam Adams seasonal beer was and she told us they didn't have it meanwhile we could see the tap from our seats. However, the server was very nice and the food was very good so this Applebee's gets a 3. They could use to get their act together."
75,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"The server I had was very sweet however, I think the food I had ordered was absolutely inedible and completely overpriced. They handled the situation good which is why I'm giving them 2 stars but honestly; the place is always DEAD. And not that clean. My food came out burnt, tasting like plastic and under seasoned. I'm not ever planning to come here again."
76,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This place is horrible. When I came here two days ago the service was ok , minus the waitress thinking it was ok to tell me she had a hangover. But unfortunately I left my credit card here.I called yesterday to see if it was here and the guy on the phone said yes and said I could pick it up no problem. Came in and the girl at the front said she couldn't find it. She said I had to wait for a manager. Well 45 mins later after asking a few more times where the manager is, the hostess said she could take my number down and was really rude. Why would anyone want to come back here when they leave a customer waiting for her CREDIT CARD and the staff acts its ok to leave me waiting for 45 minutes. Bad service, bad staff"
77,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Had a horrible experience at this place i walked in the server took firever to see us i asked for a beer with my food because i had wings that were hot my mouth was on fire and i did not get a beverage till my meal was finished he messed up the orders and he messed up the bill
78,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I usually like this Applebee's, mostly because of the good customer service. But Jesus Christ! They are hiring some seriously shitty bartenders. I came in today at about 9pm and the female bartender they have now (Hispanic, short black straight hair and glasses) she has a terrible attitude, didn't greet us, didn't smile, even after she finally got to us and we ordered some drinks she dissappeared without getting our drinks, we had to ask someone else to get the drinks. They need to get the girls they had when they first opened."
79,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,My favorite spot every Thursday ever since my wife and I sat at the Bar and Frank (bartender) tended to us. He's awesome. Thanx Frank!!!
80,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,After a long week I decided to bring my girlfriend out for dinner to Applebees to have a relaxing dinner and some drinks. As soon as we step foot into the establishment we had go wait about 20 minutes to be seated when the restaurant was fairly empty. After being seated we waited another 30 minutes to have the server come to us. Then after the appetizers came we waited another 15 mins for stencils. During all this time the bartender decided to play music from his cellphone on a Bluetooth speaker playing explicit music. Songs with the words fuck and nigga should not be played in a place of business especially where families and children are present. My girlfriend on several occasions asked the manager to have them turn off the music and he refused. This is not a way to run a business and it was an overall horrible experience.  I spent over $130 tonight (11/24/17) and because of this experience I will never go to another Applebees again. I made me feel degraded to hear all those curses and as if this business does not know how to train it's employees or select proper people to run them. Very unprofessional and horrible. So disappointed.
81,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This is about the 4th time I came here with friends/family and it still doesn't surprise me how overrated this Applebee's is. Last time I sat in the bar with friends and the female bar tender ignored us (only had a drink each). Waited 30minutes for any attention. Numerous of times the manager needs to be called because of the incompetent staff, dirty dishes not cleaned and their forgetfulness about  your orders (which are placed on the tablet they have on the table). Thumbs down & find another place to dine in where the food isn't overly salted and soggy."
82,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"The food is good i enjoy the atmosphere. The employees were kind and very friendly. I appreciate how the employee even helped us out with saving money. She could have just taken our order and not even told us, but the fact that she notice we could order the same items and save about 10 dollars I was thankful for that. The manager was kind as well he made sure we were enjoying ourselves and made sure our food was great. I would come again. The food won't wow you, but it's a good place to get a quick meal. I'm giving it 4 stars based on the service than the actual food. With service like that I'm sure more people will come in."
83,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,So I got here for lunch with a friend. We ordered and the food came out incorrect the Bartender was extremely nice about it and said don't worry and went to get the manager Jennifer who immediately hooked is up with a beer while we waited on the the food which came out perfect this time. Normally when things go wrong it's a oh well situation. Thanks for making it all good.
84,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Came here with the family today after a long draining morning and afternoon.  The service was awesome and the manager Jamie has to be one of the friendliest and genuinely nicest guys I have ever met at any restaurant!  He took care of my family as if they were his own...thank you sir and we will be back soon!
85,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"I have had a few bad experiences recently with Applebee's. When I walked in I said that if this location is as terrible as the last few I have been I would never step foot in another Applebee's again. Great service, clean taps, excellent happy hour... I will be back :)"
86,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I have been to this Applebee's before. I'm wait 15 min for someone to ask me if I need something to drink or I wanted to order something? Well at this point I should just walk out! I don't thinking give them a chance. Well I placed my order. Got my dinner before my appetizer! I guess better then the last time. I got both at the same time. Maybe come for a beer that's about it.
87,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"For the first time ever my wife and I DID NOT tip any of the three that waited on us. Tonight was the worst dinning experience we've encountered, and we only asked for appetizers. We sat at the bar, and received our food not the way we wanted. Not once were we asked if we are fine, neither were we asked if we wanted desert at the end of our meal. Not one of the three checked on us to ask if we were okay. This is the worst Apple Bee's that we've ever been in. To top it off, it took us about 20 minutes to pay the bill, I had to grab the hostess from the front to come and help us. So, if you come to this place be prepared for the half ass service."
88,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This place must think it is a nightclub, loud horrible music. I can't even hear my son sitting next to me. This is the last time we will come here!"
89,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This location lacks professionalism. The hostess was on her cell phone when I entered the restaurant. Once seated at the table two waitresses argued on who was going to take the table, as if we had the plague and they did not want to catch it. After 2 minutes one surrendered and said ""fine I'll take the table"" to add insult to injury they've rolled their eyes and ask so y'all know what y'all want???  Now I understand that Applebee's isn't s 5 star restaurant however professionalism is a must in any establishment."
90,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"This use to be one of my favorite applebees, after last night it is no longer. I assume it's under new management because as often as I go I'd never seen the manager I saw last night before. Went I entered the applebees there wasn't anyone present at the host stand and nor did anyone come when they saw me and my boyfriend standing there. After waiting for about 10 minutes we sat ourselves down and still no one attended us. I looked at the bar and saw someone who looked like they work there, it turned out to actually be the manager. He was sitting at the bar socializing. After telling him how I sat myself down he apologized and ensured someone will attend to me shortly, and then he proceeded back to the bar to sit and finish his conversation. Our server was okay other than bringing our food out and forgetting our utensils and bringing them 5 minuets later. My boyfriend ordered a steak well done, he got mid way into it and it the steak wasn't cooked well done and showed a lot of pink. They ended up taking it off the bill, but still it was just an annoying experience all together. I was very disappointed."
91,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"My boyfriend and I did the 2 for $20. We ordered the mozzarella stick appetizer. Not sure if it's different at each Applebees but they gave 4 mozzarella sticks rather than 7-8 that they give at an applebees in LI. The unsweetened ice tea tasted horrible, the frozen strawberry lemonade was very watery, hardly anything ""frozen"" about it. I got the chicken fajita wrap which was good as well as the fries which tasted fresh and crispy. The bathroom only has 1 stall and i almost fell on the floor due to the toilet seat being broke. Staff was friendly, environment was clean."
92,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Poor customer service at the bar.... I am usually here every Thursday and it's the same low quality service with the same bartenders. I understand when it's crowded and it is hard for the bartenders to attend to customers but as far as tonight there are 14 people including my boyfriend and I. Everyone else has their order and we've been waiting here for approximately 25 Minutes and no one has taken our order or even asked if we are ready. Like I said this is a every week thing. One of the bartenders Frank tries hard to accommodate customers to the best of his ability but the female bartenders only focus one side or group of people which is very unprofessional. If this kind of bad service is not being taken cared of I will be forced to speak to the manager personally about proper training for customer service because this is complete BS. The only reason I come to this location is because it is very low key... If this location wasn't so convenient I would not come back.
93,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,The food is average Applebees...but the customer service is terrible. They are slow slow slow. It wasn't even crowded. Dont waste your time.
94,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,HORRIBLE!!!! Came here with 3 of my friends before for some drinks and food for happy hour. Sat at the bar the bar was not clean at all. Only 1 employee was working the bar which was not a bartender he was a manager. Very unorganized. Approached an EMPLOYEE NAME DOMONIQUE SHE WAS VERRRRYYYYYYYYY RUDEEE WITH US. She wears glasses and has a nasty attitude. I will not be eating at this establishment anymore. She needs to be fired or held accountable for the rudeness towards customers. Long story short fuck this place
95,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Best Applebee's Ive ever been to.  The manager Jaime is awesome, professional, accommodating and a really great guy.  He is really concerned with his customers and did right by us in one instance.  The waitstaff is friendly and professional.  A neighborhood gem for sure!!"
96,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Went there on three separate occasions and it was bad every time - ( the good- the place is nice its new and still is in great shape- its convenient - has ample parking - great menu choices as any Applebee's - etc.) The most recent visit was a Sunday around 10pm- seated immediately place was fairly empty - which is why we couldn't understand the problems we had - the waitress was very nice and she did her best but we ordered ( wanted to do drinks first ? Wouldn't take appetizers) and it literally took 20-25 min for the appetizers to come out and the green beans came out with no sauce and were like rubber - yuck - we asked finally for sauce (took 5-8min for someone to even check on us) and they brought us like a thousand island sauce - not the wasabi that goes with green beans  -sent back Offered to drop another batch but the moment passed and my taste for them was gone - The entrees were ok- but again another 20-25 minutes from appetizers  (with a rather empty place) !  There were times where the servers, host/hostess and just everyone was off the floor- maybe in the kitchen?! Dunno - contemplated leaving - the manager came over wanted to make it up to us said he would give us business card for two free appetizers and never saw him again He was nice and the gesture was nice - but as we explained this wasn't the first time visiting this Applebee's and again never saw him again. I don't leave bad reviews and I didn't the first 2 times - but 3rd is a charm - Every time we have gone it's slow or lack luster service and takes forever to get food - maybe they will get better?! Maybe they are better at lunch times? Dunno but don't care to find out. . ."
97,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"What an incredible experience at Applebees Throggs Neck today, Veterans Day.  My husband and I really appreciate that they offer veterans dinner on Veterans Day each year.  We came with our kids and were really impressed by how the manager, Eddie came around to make sure we were ok and we saw him go around to the other tables as well. They had a full house but they made sure they took care of everyone.  It was a really great dining experience for us.  Our waiter, Abby was very attentive and we were really blown away by the incredible service.  The food was excellent as well and I just love their spinach artichoke dip!"
98,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Great staff!!! Food is great Happy Hour is phenomenal!!! The management team rocks!!! The whole location is just amazing!!! Ladies nights on Wednesdays are the best, the ladies from Mary Kay are there giving hand rubs and free samples. They have a lady from Origami Owls there as well with remarkable jewelry pieces!! They know you by name once you become a regular like myself!!! Great Job Applebees!!!"
99,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Maybe because this Applebee's is fairly new they are trying to iron out the kinks... The staff is pretty un organized and unsure of what they should be doing... My table ordered 4 Long Island ice teas which were not made correctly the manager had to bring shots of the missing ingredients... The food didn't all come out at the same time  2 guest at my table waited over 10 mins for their plates while the rest of the tables food was delivered the mistakes were noticeable and I hope as time goes on they can  correct their service issues...
100,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Only 1 star because 0 stars is not an option. I come here frequently and always have a great experience, but today was just TERRIBLE. Let me start off with the fact that the hostess told us that it is a 10-20 min wait for a less than half full space, the excuse was that the tables weren't clean... I checked the space and that obviously was a total lie, lol. She just didn't want to say that they are short staffed. Next, their soda machine broke down, our server advised that they have to go to the nearby Target to get some Pepsi - that Pepsi took a long while. I asked for a Lemonade Quencher that gets strawberry pieces in it, the drink came looking like all the sugar was at the bottom & the lemonade was just poured in with some ice - no fruits. I asked the server about the fruit pieces & was told that they never put fruit in them - this is my go to Applebee's drink, it always gets fruit and the menu clearly states the same (she then admits they do not have any fruits). We ordered some classic buffalo wings, they came with no celery - we asked for some celery and guess what?! Yupp, you guessed it! They had no celery either. The waitress then goes on to ask us if we want our entrees now....what?!? She takes a long time to bring that too - she totally forgot about us and the manager came by advising that he was sorry, that she is new and gave us some discounts or whatever (by the way she is not new, I have seen her several times in the past months.) We asked for some cheese because one of the entrees was tasteless, she forgot that too. It was just an ongoing series of events where the service was terrible, the food was tasteless, beverages were gross, and of the manager coming by to say that he was sorry to try and cover for her lack of attention.  This manager clearly treats staff as friends, so there is no sense of respect or urgency. This location has fallen apart, unfortunately. How do you run a restaurant with no basic products? I, as a previous food service worker would NEVER let this happen. And if these were the circumstances that I would have to work under, I would have a plan and work extra hard on my customer services skills, because although the product is what really makes the consumer happy, an attentive waiter/waitress creates the experience."
101,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,Service is great ! I go almost every day for drinks on my lunch break food is fresh and always to my liking...highly recommend it....
102,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,I love that new turkey sandwich with the coleslaw that they have you guys need to try it. It's awesome
103,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Had a very positive experience at the Applebee's at the  Throggs Neck shopping center.My girlfriend and I are doing a 30 day strick diet which has limit us to preparing all meals at home. We were running errands and decided to stop at Applebee's for a steak and a salad. We looked over the menu, I decided instead on the herb crusted steak, which came with roasted cherry tomatoes, saute spinach, and broccoli. She had the 9oz steak and veggies with a baked potato. We requested a few changes in the food preporation. We asked about steaming our veggies as opposed to sautéing in butter. Our waitress Elizabeth was more than accommodating and went above and beyond. She then explained the situation to the manager, Jaime P. Our waitress returned and informed us that the manager would personally prepare our meal. The steak was cooked exactly how we asked, the veggies were steamed perfectly, and it was complimented with roasted cherry tomatoes and steamed spinach. We were extremely pleased by the service, the attention to detail, and the food. Two thumbs up!!!"
104,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"They have officially been in this neighborhood for a year now! Although they've have a little bit of a turnover on staff, the changes have been positive! Their staff is super energetic and polite! Now onto the important stuff, food! Ok it's a chain restaurant so it serves what all chain restaurants of this kind serve. However being a sucker for these types of establishments this one has been by far the best!!! Their food always comes to the table fresh, and unlike other chains I've been to, I've never gotten sick from anything at this particular location. I average about once a month in visits here (usually when I'm coming to the mall for groceries) location not too bad, free parking available. It's truly eating good in THIS neighborhood! Lastly, the noise level totally decent! You can have a conversation over dinner with your party without yelling. Oh before I forget my last two and most favorite words that this location has mastered HAPPY HOUR!!!"
105,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Horrible experience, won't be back. From the time we order our drinks they were served in dirty glasses, the quality of food was no where near decent. Not like any Applebee's I've been to. I've never had a salad served on a plate with more cole slaw then lettuce, it hard to mess up a salad, but they did! Cheap doesn't even explain how limited they were on they're serving size literally 20 fries come with the burger of mcdonalds quality. At the end to pay 65 dollars for a salad burger a dirty beer was ridiculous, if I could have walked out I would have and not gave a dime. I can be sure to not give another penny to that business horrible food cheap cheap cheap with plates and horrible presentation. Doesn't deserve a star even for a rating. A waste of a night"
106,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"What originally started as a bad review, i feel i owe to them at least an update. Wile being an angry customer, it doesnt help to get the run around. I made this review to receive the attention i required. Another manager named jennifer saw my review n felt a massive need to get in touch with me. After speaking with her, the original person i tried getting in touch with finally called me back. Hes the reason the review is still low...he was dismissive n was making it seem like i was lying to get money back (really $15? Not like i fought for my entire meal to be refunded). Overall, jennifer kept getting in contact with me and ensured me i would receive the refund. Wile i understand customer service can be difficult at times (i work in the medical field as front desk)..there were simpler ways to resolve it without me resorting to negative reviews to get my point across. This location is fairly new, i live in the area, i have hopes of it getting better and when it does ill give it a second chance. After all, another reviewer said the same after a few tries of going there. I appreciate each person that reached out to me personally to make things right."
107,tnM37Gdwr5RaFkDRXBHavg,"Let us just take note that i downloaded the yelp app JUST to write this review.Went there twice, and will no longer be going. On may 29th i went with my fiance for lunch to this location. My servers name was Jessica and when i went to pay the bill she first gives me the wrong bill. I give her my card to pay and when she asks me to sign i saw 2 different balances. Instead of $40 it was $66, when i asked why she brought me the correct receipt and apologized. I let it go. I even left her a $15 cash tip. Thankfully i kept my receipt, i check my bank statement and see she charged my card $81. So not only did she get a $15 cash tip she got another $15 ""tip"" from my card! Ive called the location n the ""manager"" gives me another number to call to get reimbursed but nobody answers and im getting the run around. Wile its ""only $15"", its principal. Your servers are supposed to be honest and trustworthy with your cards. Never again. Side note- the appetizer boneless wings i got were cold when they got to my table anyway. Not even worth the trip to this place.  Others were also leaving due to wait time on their food."
108,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Loved the food . Best Diner out here . The min I walked in I felt welcomed . The food is amazing & The servers were friendly . The give you coffee the min you sit down and the service is really fast . I recommend this Diner to anyone that I wanna have a nice Sunday or any day breakfast . I ALSO RECOMMEND THE HOME FRIES  my new spot to go on Sundays with my husband.
109,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Overall fabulous experience! Best diner I've been to in the Bronx. Truly local which you'll experience on arrival. Our waitress was lovely and took effort to look into ingredients that couldn't be in the meal. The dishes were large, cheap, and tasty! I got the fish and oh my was it good. Also got the egg malt, also delicious! I left stuffed!!!I will certainly be going back and am excited to take guests there for a Sunday brunch and late dinner."
110,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Tibbett Diner is a nice little spot, with a welcoming environment. The waitress was extremely fast and friendly; she made me feel like a regular. The food portions are very generous and the pricing gets them an ""A+."" I cannot wait to go back and try other things on the menu!"
111,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"It's a diner.If you grew up in the Westchester area at all, you'll recognize this as any other diner you've ever been too. Same menu, same food. Don't get me wrong, I'm a fan of diner food, just don't go here expecting anything out of the ordinary. We got a chicken parm (with a side of over cooked pasta, again very typical diner fare!) and a Ruben. Asked for well done fries. They were semi crispy. Definitely have had crispier at other diners.Quick warning for those driving to tibbits, there is a private lot, however there's only a few spots as far as I was able to tell, so you'll probably need to find street parking. The place is on the small side as well, but chances are if there is a wait, you won't have to wait long since diner food is usually a notoriously quick turn around."
112,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"How the hell does this place get such high reviews? There are so many better breakfast places in the Bronx. The only thing this place has is pleasant customer service, otherwise very average food. Dried out eggs, flat omelettes, overcooked fries, old burnt bacon, poor tea selection--that's just my meal. Get real. My little niece and nephew drag me here all the time because they like to sit in a booth, and because they like how many pancakes they get. But they know good food about as well as they know good music--not at all. Here this picture should tell you everything:"
113,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Husband and I got sick eating here today. Ordered breakfast which was quite good but both of us had stomach issues right after eating here.  Not a good sign. Maybe cook should wash his hands more often? Servers too. Needless to say, we will not be eating here again."
114,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"An adorable vintage diner with great dishes, courteous staff, and low prices. It didn't take long to be seated at a table either and the wait for our food wasnt long and exactly what I requested. I would most definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a casual bite to eat."
115,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Thanksgiving 2018: plans to meet friends fell through but wife and I were in the mood for traditional American T-day fare. The Tibbett had it all covered - juicy turkey with fine gravy, delicious stuffing with chestnuts and cranberries - totally passable mashed potatoes - side of veggie choices (we went with string beans, flavored and cooked soft the way I like 'em); cranberry jelly, a glass of wine, slice of pie, and coffee/tea; OH and soup or salad starter (I had a fine cream of turkey soup). All for $23.99, no charge for a sharing plate -- wife & I are moderate eaters--and no shitty attitude from waiter when we said we'd be sharing.Began with a round of warm delicious bread/breadsticks, all delivered with speedy, smiling service in this old-school, tiny diner (with parking--granted, a tiny lot, but street parking is always available). I've been a regular for breakfast for 20 years, but now stopping by for a weekly dinner too after this fine, heartfelt Thanksgiving feast.. Let's support these little old family-owned diners and hope they stick around--a place with genuine New York feeling and atmosphere in a world that's getting more homogenous and corporate. (Starbucks, chain joints,...no thanks!)"
116,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,I've been to the start of the few times the dinner was very very good there recently I had lunch there with a friend and their food is fresh much better than I would've expected. It's centrally located not far from the one train so it's walkable and it's on the way to everywhere so very centrally located. The only thing that's strange about the restaurant is if they only have Pepsi and no Diet Coke but that's not a big deal. The waitresses are nice they're friendly it's clean and their sirloin burger is quite good.
117,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Pancakes! The fluffiest pancakes I have ever gotten in my life. I loved the old classic diner feel and was super ecstatic about the prices. I was distracted a few times looking at a older gentleman taking the bottom of the mashed potatoes and slamming it back on top of the potatoes. You will see a very eclectic mix of people in the diner which will make it the best place to people watch as well.
118,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Came here yesterday for brunch.Was extremely busy but still we waited less than 10 mins to be seated. Service is excellent.Food tasted really good and the portion size is perfect -  not too much food which i often find diners doI loved it. A really cozy cute interior too. I will be coming back soon
119,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Best open secret in Riverdale. You would not know how great this place is from the outside. It looks like any diner but it is so much more. The menu is extensive, and features loads of fish. I've been back twice and have gotten the Sea Bass both times. It's bone-in, ridiculously fresh and almost floating in seasoned butter. Most entrees come with choice of potato, vegetable, and soup or salad. Prices are great for what you get."
120,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I have been going here for decades.  It's a reliably good diner with standard, sometimes exceptional, food.  I would normally recommend it but for the past few months, they've been off.  One of the longtime busboys has been noticeably rude.  More than once, he has taken away either my food or drink before I was finished and today was the last straw.  Today, the same busboy cleared my companion's items without asking, then less than 5 minutes later, comes back to try and take my coffee cup OUT OF MY HAND while I was still holding it, saying ""You're done, right?""  We weren't hogging the table, and even if they wanted us to clear the table for another group, there's a polite way to do that.I hope the management takes note.  Respect your customers (especially your regulars) and maybe ask before taking their food or drink away. Or they won't come back."
121,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Best Diner this side of the Bronx.. we've been coming here for over 20 years. Pancakes, hamburgers , French toast are to die for! We're here at least once a week. Staff knowledgeable And friendly, Irene weekend waitress is super sweet and fast, very personable. Would highly recommend this place. Sunday mornings expect a slight wait though."
122,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"So I had to go to the Bronx after a strenuous work out at the gym. So at the request of a friend decided to go to this diner. Now mind you I am spoiled with the diners in Queens, so this was going to have to be above average to make me happy.All that in mind, let's cut straight to it. Came on a Sunday afternoon and it was moderately full. Saw some plates and they looked decent enough, so my hopes were up. Maybe I am used to big menus over in Queens, but the menu here was lacking and it's choices left a lot to be desired. After about 10 mins of looking for something appealing to magically appear, I asked the server if he had grilled chicken breast. He points out a sandwich off the menu, then again a wrap. So after explaining a chicken breast meal. He suggested a salad with a slice of chicken on top. ""Ok, sounds simple enough!"" My friend ordered the chicken wrap with fries. If I told you the best part of our meals was her pickle, you wouldn't believe me.The food was bland. The lettuce brown. Just not good food. This was a once and never again thing because I'll never eat at a diner in the Bronx again. Or at least not here. Definitely not a good diner."
123,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Went for lunch today with spouse. Had the baby back ribs and a turkey club. Both the turkey and the ribs were dry, so not very flavorful. The split pea soup was good, mashed potatoes okay, but the cauliflower tasted funny.The service was fine, but strangely when we asked them to wrap up the leftovers, they only gave us half the remaining ribs (of course didn't discover this until we got home).Portions are large and prices are reasonable."
124,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This place seems like a neighborhood staple. I found it interesting that the servers knew the customers by their first name. They already knew what kind of drink they wanted as they sat down. It was like Cheers in a diner version.I ordered the french toast with scrambled eggs, toast, chamomile tea and apple juice. I actually prefer diners over places like iHOP. Its more authentic and personable. My uncle lives close by and recommended this place. I'd come back although I've had better french toast.The establishment was clean, the service was fast, the food was good and parking was available. What more can you ask for from a diner?!"
125,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Decent family diner with a nice menu. Being a southern boy I am always disappointed when I can't get grits with my eggs. With some seasoning, or just salt and pepper would make big difference with their meal preparation, but I guess that's how they like it since the place was crowded. Parking is limited by the dinner so either get there early or be ready to walk your meal off afterwards."
126,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Best...diner...ever! Nick and John do a spectacular job with this small place. You'd expect breakfast to be great. ..and it is...but it's also the best seafood restaurant in the Riverdale / Kingsbridge / Marble Hill area. Happy to say been going there since it opened in '93!
127,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Typical diner. Very fast service. Good food. Pricing is good. your coffee cup will never be empty. plenty of seating. Plenty of parking.Got their no. 9 breakfast special - challah french toast with sausage. Comes with coffee or OJ. Sausages were large, juicy, and oily but oh so good. Definitely recommend."
128,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Elaine was an awesome waitress. The juices are very good. I loved the philly steak wrap
129,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Best French toast ever!  I'd been craving French toast for a few days and needed some. Decided to stop here for breakfast- coffee, OJ, bacon, eggs and French toast - I know it's a lot of food. Breakfast is my favorite meal. It was super busy but I sat at the counter and the service was speedy and friendly. And my food was out within 5 minutes. Everything was amazing! I'd definitely come back!"
130,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Lunch time during the business week has taken my food travels to Kingsbridge in the Bronx.With a co-worker this diner has a small parking lot.  Tibbett Diner is named after it's location on Tibbett Avenue.  A diner is no diner without booths as cushion seats.  We were immediately seated at a booth when suddenly I was sliding from the cushion seat as it had no substance and was not properly manufactured nor installed correctly.  We switched tables so our butts was able to anchor in place without sliding. Without clarity, I ordered a fruit salad as was dissatisfied as I should have ordered a burger.  My co-worker ordered a burger which appeared flavorful and tasty.  Service is attentive.  No comment on their facilities as we did not utilized."
131,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Will not come back here again. The waiters have attitudes, diner could use an overhaul with cleanliness and they are not customer friendly.I ordered tea (earl grey) along with milk. The milk was not fresh so I asked the waiter for another tea bag - he said ""you will be charged for 2 tea bags...""  Really? I did not drink the spoiled tea. What kind of place treat customers like this?  The food was so-so - I did not like how the waiter took the English muffin out of the toaster with his hands and not wearing gloves. Riverdale Diner is down the street; I'd recommend that!"
132,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Awesome place to eat.Love this place.The staff is absolutely amazing and everyone is a regularFood is quick and their coffee is awesome.The only thing they don't have is space, it's a small diner! I wish it was bigger!!!"
133,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Gets the job done. I love the challah French toast. Great juices for breakfast, nice hot coffee. Very polite and experienced staff who care about the customers."
134,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Breakfast was awesome.  I had eggs, bacon, home fries and toast and it was phenomenal.  Friend had an irish breakfast: eggs with black pudding and they did an incredible job.  Clean, great service, and great food.  All for a reasonable price, definitely recommend."
135,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Pros:(+) They have a parking lot(+) Buttermilk pancakes are delicious(+) Inexpensive (+) Fast service(+) Small Parking Lot Cons:None~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~I love this diner. Still has it's original old school feel to it with it's cushioned booth seats, breakfast bar area and everything else which makes this diner look really cute.  Parking is never an issue, which is great. You can park either on the street or on their small parking lot that holds about 8-10 cars. The food is inexpensive, the service is fast, the food is tasty and what makes diner food, diner food."
136,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This is a great diner, especially knowing that there are several diner options in the neighborhood. The food is delicious, the service is amazing and the speed of food is perfect.  The waiters and cooks actually listen to how you order stuff so that's a big plus!"
137,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Tibbett's is exactly what you want from a diner - friendly staff, quick service, classic standards for the menu, and cute diner-y décor. We've taken so many houseguests here and they all love it too! It's definitely a terrific neighborhood spot, and I love the fact that the waitresses there seem to know everybody who comes in and out. I'm sure I'll be back again and again - hope to see you there! :)"
138,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,This place is an absolute gem. The people are lovely and the food is fantastic. The omelettes are superb and never rubbery. The burgers are everything a good diner burger should be. I also love the gyros.
139,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"One of the better diners in The Bronx, good food, coffee, and always good service. I know  have had many meals in this diner. Never have they made me leave unhappy. I have eaten breakfast, lunch and dinner here, they are always on point. Their disco fries are my favorite. If I ever had to pick a diner again in the Bronx this one would definitely bevin my top five. F.Y.I my most favorite thing here is the service.  They really are nice and pleasant people, and always make sure to give you the attention you need."
140,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Highly recommend Tibbett Diner. They have many varieties for breakfast, Lunch & Dinner. Definitely going back to try everything on the menu."
141,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"The sweet potato fries were to die for! I dipped them in the blue cheese dressing that came with our salad but they were good on their own. We also ordered beef brisket and pasta, both were decent."
142,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Overrated..... I have come here on a Sunday, more than once, don't know what people find special about this place. There is always a wait and they don't serve anything outstanding for dinner food. It's a small place, that may be why you would wait longer than usual to be seated."
143,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This is the cutest diner I have ever eaten in... situated and hidden north of Manhattan, on the border of the Bronx this place is so picturesque... it's small and perfectly simple yet maintained that rustic NYC Diner style ambiance... The price is also very affordable... I was looking for a place to have good quality breakfast and found this through Google map... It has a very small 7 car parking in front but tons of street anyway... I came on a Monday morning and it wasn't busy; I could only imagine it if it where... but nonetheless. This place is very nostalgic; reminds me off old NYC neighborhood diner and the frequent patrons just made my experience all the more awesome... the staff was very attentive and courteous... The place is clean and that's a huge plus for me... the seats are worn but still maintained well... (no I don't mean they held it up with tape) it's quite affordable and a great lil hideaway from the hustle and bustle of the big city... give it a shot if you find yourself in the area and want some quality solitude time with yummy breakfast...."
144,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Excellent service! We were served by a gentlemen who wore a hat that read ""MEXICANO HASTA EL TOPE"" I knew immediately that this place was the right business to support. My partner ordered a burger, he commented that it was juicy and flavorful. My pancakes were delicious and fuffy, just how I like'm. We ordered home fries but they were more like hashbrowns, not what we had in mind but a good surprise."
145,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This is a hidden gem in the riverdale section of the bronx stopped by for a quick bite and at first was a bit skeptical as the place looked really small and outdated from the outside the service was fast  i ordered a western omelette with cheese homefries and wheat toast and ate the whole meal delicious!!!! coffee was really good too didn't have a bitter taste it is a bit outdated but the food, cleanliness and service makes up for it will def be back here for some good breakfast! And great service"
146,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,This place is my favorite Diner.I would eat here all the time.The staff is friendly.The food is great.
147,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,I have been eating here about once or twice a month. Service is excellent. Food very good.
148,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,My family and I eat here about twice a month.  We stop by for dinner and love the fact that they serve pancakes all day.  My daughter always orders the blueberry pancakes and my grandson loves their burgers‼  They're great.  This place has a nice retro look. The food is good and cheaper than other diners.  This place is clean and I have always found the service to be very good.  A great little diner in the Riverdale area of the Bronx!
149,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Pancakes came quick and they were super super on the money !! I like that they offer the smuckers syrup because it made them a little sweeter. They were a good size and fresh. The host seated me quickly and my server was swift but polite = perfection !!
150,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"just had breakfast & although it's reasonably priced , it wasn't that good.  The homefries were so DRY - just horrible . The toast was chewy - never quite had bread like that. Breakfast should be a slam-dunk at any worthwhile diner.  Needs much improvement"
151,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Came to the bronx for a taxes and yelped a place to eat whole waiting... Found this little place... Its a gem... And just what a diner should be... Small cozy booths and counter tables... With great cooked food... The grilled chicken on Spanish was perfectly done with the tomatoes around the dish not in the dish... It looked really pretty that way... The home fries were also good and potato are almost to a mash with some crispy areas... Definitely a local great find...bathroom floor are a little greasy but so are all the great local places... I think..
152,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I wish I would have known about this little gem of a diner years ago. The service was good,the food was great. I will definitely be going back."
153,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Not a lot if diner choices in Riverdale section of the Bronx. Sadly, this was our closest option to our location near the Spuyten Duyvil train station. This place knows how to write an order but they don't know how to follow an order and get it done right. I ordered three eggs scrambled, extra ham, fried onions and peppers in a wrap. The waiter took the order without fail but there must have been some miscommunication with the waiter and the cook. I ended up with three flecks of ham that required a search party to find and what looked like two eggs instead of three. I also learned that there are no shortage of potatoes at diners because 75% of the container was filled with them next to my tiny wrap. They failed to give me those additions but they sure didn't fail to charge me $9.00 for the wrap for those additions. The waiter and the cashier had to try to figure out what to charge me, leaving the cashier to give a major sigh of annoyance for having to be put through that Euclidian mathematics problem. The ability for diners to get any additions or subtractions to orders done correctly is paramount to diner quality. It's one of the reasons why people go to diners in the first place. Ample parking is another reason. Whoever designed the lot to this establishment didn't do a real good job of it. Of the few spots they have, one of the spaces had a fire hydrant blocking it. Pulling out of the spots requires careful technique because you are backing out into oncoming street traffic.  I know it sounds like I'm pitching a bitch but it's not like this place doesn't deserve it. I call it like I see it."
154,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Great Service Warm friendly environment reminds me of the Brooklyn diners I used to go to the food was amazing will definitely come back my waitress was a blond woman who worked the Sunday morning shift I didn't catch her name
155,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Had one off meal there but they're generally solid diner food. Burgers and salads are good.
156,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Went there this past Tuesday. Spaghetti that my friend ordered was watery and tasteless. Had to check the dental records to figure out that what I got was the hamburger I ordered - medium rare but delivered burnt beyond recognition. And the turkey in my wife's turkey club was slightly metallic looking.We were all hungry, and all in a rush going to a family event, so we chowed down and prayed we wouldn't be regretting it beyond that day. I'll go back to give them another chance and an update. (You can see from my earlier review that I was a big fan.) If there's an improvement, I'll post it, but one more experience like this and I'm out."
157,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I kept meaning to go to this place after I first moved to the Bronx, but it caught fire before I had a chance to to try it out. I figured: ""Family-owned, small business in the Bronx that's been there forever... either there's no insurance, or someone is using the payout to move to Florida.""Turns out, I was wrong. It opened back up, and boy am I glad it did.I had a really nice hamburger there today - good quality beef properly cooked, and great fries.  A week ago, it was a very solid half-chicken with great stuffing.Service is friendly and attentive, the other diners were nice (nicer than me, anyway... not really a sterling testimonial, I know) and free parking is a big plus. Four stars!"
158,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Arrived at the diner at 6:05 p.m. on Sunday. The diner was NOT busy. We were seated on the left side of the diner. There was only 1 table waiting to be served their food on the left side.  The waiter never came over to take out order or acknowledged us.We waited 15 minutes for the waiter to come over and finally decided to leave. The owner was at the cash register.  Perhaps he needs to pay more attention to what his staff is doing. One waiter was seated at the 2 seats at the counter. The waiter on the right side of the dinerwas the only one working.
159,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,A nice find not far off the highway with easy parking. Arrived early and was greeted with a very friendly staff... a wide variety of breakfast specials (I had a farmers omelette and it was delish).. and the staff was super attentive. I'll definitely go back!
160,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Ate there three times. Like a fool returned. Not again, ever. Found a table and sat, only to be told this was for a party of 4  and since it was only me, I would have to move! Did not observe a rush of people coming in at 11:00 AM!Had to ask and wait for coffee refill, plus the food was lack luster. Breakfast is simple enough to make, eggs, potatoes, meat , toast. Somehow the eggs were hard, not over easy, the food took a minute to be served also. Tiny place . Should be a gem, but was a disappointment."
161,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Very happy that this place is walking distance to my house!! I came here quiet on a stormy day and ordered breakfast.  You can't go wrong with breakfast.  Over easy, perfectly cooked. Home fries I asked for it well done and it was crunchy, and mashed inside, YUM!  Bacon was a bit overcooked to my liking but still a hefty portion for a cheap price.  Service was attentive and my coffee was constantly refilled.  Will be back here again."
162,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Amazing place! I have been coming here for a while, the food is amazing and the service is stupendous. However,  I became a vegan two months ago and the place does not have much options for me. Hopefully that will change soon so I can return every weekend the way I used to. Overall, good spot for those whos diets do not conflict with the menu."
163,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Great Food and Great Friendly Service. I've been to many of the Riverdale diners and this place is the best. I won't go anywhere else.Enjoy your meal. Satisfaction Guaranteed.
164,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Was amazing! Great food and was very nice when my daughter was sad about them not having waffles. Very family friendly.
165,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Food was very good, but service was slow. It seemed as though we were imposing on our waitress by being in the diner. My toast arrived 10 minutes after my omelet did. Prices were very reasonable, though.Had to park on the street and feed the meter as they have very little of their own parking."
166,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This place is great when not too busy.  But on a busy morning like today, seems like service falls down and they're rushing you to leave.  The man up front at the register always has stern, unfriendly attitude, like he's mad he has to be there.    Not what you want to see as you're leaving!  Kingsbridge Donut Shop always so busy, workers at least put on a smile, will stick with them."
167,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I called for delivery, I live 5 mins away by foot, 3 mins away on bike, the man told me they don't deliver cause It's too far, really???!!!!"
168,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Good food. Easy parking. Not too crowded. It's a diner - so order diner fare and enjoy.
169,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Went here for the first time today for breakfast. Got in about 7:45am and it was pretty empty, filled up by 8:30 though. The breakfast sausage was some of the best i've had though! Food was brought out in about 5 minutes and was smoking hot. Great service, nice people. Will definitely be returning!"
170,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Perfectly ok diner, harkening back to the time when there weren't expressways killing the South Bronx. Eggs were ok, hash browns were ok, muffin was well toasted. Nothing gourmet, but a real neighborhood place and filled with true characters. The garden out front is a great touch as well."
171,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This place was highly recommended by a waitress working in another diner. She said the food was delicious and that the chicken  pot pie which they make once a week was to die for.  When we arrived we noticed that it was a tiny diner by diner standards and we were lucky to get a parking spot in their small lot. Ordered the chicken pot pie which came with soup--New England clam chowder. The soup was full of celery and some carrots, not creamy at all and did not taste of clams. I skipped this course after a few spoons. The chicken pot pie lacked the celery that is so essential to a good pot pie. By now my readers know that I am  a master of pot pies so my recommendations are meaningful. Chef: cut the mushroom out of the pie and add celery. Also add a bit of black pepper and a smidgen more of salt. Remember that mushrooms have their best flavor sautéed or stuffed in the oven.  The crust was fine. Not super flakey but fine. The star of the evening was the bluefish that my husband ordered. Looked moist and beautiful with some garlic on it. It  was a whole fish with bones and all. Maybe that is why he found it so tasty. That came  with a fresh salad, choice of potato and choice of vegetables. He  chose zucchini. The baked potato was a baked potato. But the zucchini was disappointing as it was under salted and needed a bit more garlic---it needed something.   The  complementary bread basket  had a chunk of bread that was fresh but no flavor. The breadsticks were stale. I ordered a linzer tart which was soft to the touch perhaps because it was freshly baked or that the New York humidity had gotten to it.  I would not order one again. I noted that the clientele was mostly Medicare eligible or perhaps that is the reason for the low salt on most of the items we tried. I was sprinkling salt all over the place. All in all this was not a bad place to eat if you live close by and want some home cooking. The meals seem all to be made from scratch.  The waiter was very attentive and was efficient. I can only give this diner 3 stars-- bluefish, service, and freshness of the food."
172,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Classic neighborhood diner/luncheonette.Excellent food and prices for what it is.Could be stepped up in some ways, such as putting syrup on the table instead of packets (pet peeve) but the quality of the food is excellent and the preparation always shows a care for detail, never burnt or cold etc.Really nice people and owner as well."
173,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I moved to the Bronx this year, and found that this was the most consistently decent diner in the area. I went with my fiancee a few times a month, up until my last experience.I have a serious nut allergy. This is very common, and most places are very accommodating. I had always ordered breakfast foods until this particular day, when I decided to have the roast turkey. Roast turkey. When have you ever ordered roast turkey, and had nuts in it? Of course, I found out the hard way that this particular roast turkey did indeed have walnuts in some sort of stuffing found underneath. I ate a few bites, and immediately I knew I had eaten nuts, because I started to feel sick. I alerted my server, and simply asked for him to take back my turkey and remove it from my check.The server went to ask his manager for permission to do that. The manager was standing maybe 10 feet away from me, behind a partial dividing wall, and I could clearly see him whispering to my server, and shaking his head, occasionally glancing over at me. The server, of course, came back to me with his manager's ""generous"" offer of reducing the price of my meal to the price of a sandwich, since I had eaten some. Never mind the fact that I'm heading to the hospital upon leaving because they decided it would be a great idea to not inform their customers of NUTS in their TURKEY. I mean, it's not like I ordered pecan pie here.Anyway, I got the manager's attention myself, and asked him to come over to the table (since he is already watching this transaction like a hawk from 10 feet away, we may as well cut out the middle man). I explained the situation, and the fact that my throat was swelling more by the minute, and that ALL I WANTED was for him to remove that one item from my check. I didn't ask for a free meal; my fiancee had certainly enjoyed her whole meal, and I did have a bialy and some coffee, all of which I intended to pay for.The manager's response alone is the reason I will never go back to Tibbett Diner in my life:""Fine, you don't wanna pay, you piece of s***?? Then leave! Get out of my restaurant!""So, I did. Permanently.I could never support a business run by someone like that, regardless of how good the food is. Go somewhere else. Anywhere."
174,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"My families go-to diner in Riverdale. If you're looking for quality breakfast for a good price, look no further. Friendly and attentive servers who will take good care of you. A bit small inside though, not great if you have a big group."
175,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I went here after a morning run with my mom and got the usual. Silver dollar pancakes with two over medium eggs and turkey sausage. I have been going to other diners just to get a sense of other pancakes.None of these even are comparable to tibbett's diner. The pancakes are fluffier than a pillow and fresh off of the oven. I dream of them. The eggs somehow are fluffy as well and are cooked to your request. Turkey sausage, sounds nasty. Why would you get that when you can get real sausage? Maybe because you keep kosher. Well I get it because it is so much better than any breakfast meat. It's salty and juicy. Amazing! We have a fat Irish waitress every time that is so sweet. She gets us our earl grey tea to start our meal. The decor is like a classic diner and it makes me feel like I'm in the 60s. They have a wonderful garden outside of the restaurant that is really pretty. The prices are very fair as well. If there where a six star option, I will choose it for this diner.Bon appetite"
176,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I have been going to Tibet's for years now. It is hands down the best diner I have ever gone to. Food is excellent as well as the service. If I ever want to go out to get a bite, tibbetts is always my first option. I LOVE this place."
177,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"We gave it s few years to get over the chest hair trauma. Returned and it's still just as good! Great breakfast, fast service, fair prices."
178,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Really liked this place for breakfast until my husband found a chest hair in his eggs :( have not returned since.
179,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Excellent. Daily breakfast combos, lunch and dinner specials can't be beat for quality and price. 2 great home made soups every day. Very efficient, friendly and customer oriented ownership and staff. Small off-street lot and street parking available. Only thing missing is delivery ""up the hill""."
180,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Been here before, usually okay. Today, I ordered a short stack of chocolate chip pancakes, and was charged the same price as a full stack. I was told the reason is that for a regular stack, there is a $2 difference between original and chocolate chip, so they added $2 to the original short stack price. 1) It was more than $2 extra. 2) Less pancakes= less chocolate chips, so it should not be the same additional charge. 3) There is no reason I should pay $7.25 for TWO chocolate chip pancakes, when a full order of chocolate chip pancakes is the exact same price. Makes no sense."
181,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I just moved to Riverdale from Park Slope and looking for those ""favorite"" spots. I came here because of the good reviews I read. I never like to sit next to too many people if possible. They seated me next to two large men. I am a small woman and so asked if I could sit at a booth in the corner. The guy who sat me immediately said no the booth is reserved for two people. After I ordered I noticed the same guy sat a man who was by himself in the same booth that I had asked about. Needless to say, it was annoying to observe this. I didn't really enjoy the food since I was irritated. I wanted to like this place but don't appreciate being treated with little respect so I won't be coming back. Next."
182,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Another excellent dinner and good value, too. Yes, its a diner -- and the booths are tight.  But the food...well, how about a 20 dollar lobster dinner with soup or salad to boot!   Italian foods really good, as are the diner faves, for sure.   Looks like the neighborhood, authenticity without hipster affectation (so it is actually authentic.)  Yum"
183,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Hate the food. Hate the service. I've only tried breakfast on several occasions but never satisfied. I prefer Riverdale Diner down the road.
184,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"For more than a half dozen years, I've been taking two buses to get to Tibbet's, my favorite diner in the Bronx, located at the foot of Riverdale, on a sidestreet of the same name.  The regulars are known by name by the wait staff, owner, and other regulars. The food at this intimate diner is far from the average expectation of other diners; even the turkey sandwich is made from a bird roasted daily (instead of that processed stuff) and with it: the best potato salad; it's like a summer picnic in winter. The delectable Friday night chicken pot pie with a crunchy crust has long been my favorite; and the specials of roasted lamb (sliced and served with a savory gravy and the fixings --the fresh green beans cooked with a tomato medley will impress): so delicious! Various fish entrees (ask for any of those stuffed with crabmeat) are not to be overlooked--nor the lobster. But you say, you're just in the mood for an omelet: yum! hot and the best. You meant you wanted the waffles? Delivered to you crisp on the outside, rich on the inside, and warm: your butter can't wait to melt. And now for dessert. My son and I think they made some adjustments--for the better-- to this sweet menu.  There is the customers' favorite: the homemade blueberry tart brimming with fresh fruit and a cookie-like crust, yum! with whipped cream. The last evening we were there, I heard the waitress say she was cutting into the fifth tart for the day  (about 16 slices per pan). And there was the most exquisite carrot cake: the kind you've come to think can only be wished for: the best kind of rich cake with a melange of nuts, raisins, carrots and warm spices in layers spread with the lightest of cream cheese frosting and toasted walnut bits (and so unlike the gooey stuff of diner cakes I've come to expect). The apple crumb pie: buttery topping, apples swaddled in a light sweet sauce, tossed with a hint of spices.  My son and I ordered these last two delights the other night, happy with our fare, but then out was brought a sight that would bring a gourmand to salivate: a pie with a voluptuous height of golden meringue covering its lemon base, looking like no other meringue pie I've ever seen, like couture for the foodie.And coffee? Rich. Hot. Lots of it. You'll walk away more than content."
185,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"We ate lunch there today and we were very pleased.  We each had a lunch special, priced at $8.50 and $8.25.  I had the spinach pie and my husband had their popular (Fridays only) chicken pot pie.  My serving portion was quite sufficient, but my husband's was *very* generous.  The specials came with either a cup of soup or a small salad.  I chose the soup, and happily today's was New England clam chowder (very good).  Both of our main dishes were delicious.  The bread was nearly tasteless, although at least it was warmed up somewhat.  Our server was friendly & feisty and the busboys were very friendly.  We met one of the owners and he was also very friendly.  One thing we discovered upon receiving the bill:  drink refills aren't free (as with my husband's iced tea).Others have mentioned the age factor of most customers, and indeed we were the youngest there (in our mid & late 50's [although let me say that I don't look my age; ha ha]).  However, everyone seemed to be a ""regular"" and the staff greeted them warmly.  We really liked that aspect.We sat in a booth and it was comfortable.  Also, their menu is huge.  Fortunately we were able to get a parking space in their (small) lot.At one point a man walked in and he looked like the actor Robert Prosky, so I couldn't resist asking him if that's who he was.  It turned out that he was indeed an actor (although not Mr. Prosky) and he'd been in a few movies."
186,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,I came here for the first time during my lunch break for a quick bite. I had the chicken quesadilla w/ french fries and a cup of soup. The food was really good. Better than I expected. I just wished the waiter was more friendly and attentive. He disappeared after like 15 minutes and I couldn't find him!! He looked bored LOL at least I got back to work on time.
187,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Food is cheap,  nothing fancy,  but always consistent.  Good portions and highly recommend if you want quick good meal!"
188,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This diner has a good decor and old school diner vibe to it. Food choices are ok, service was mediocre, and prices for a diner were not worth it.Will have to think about this place before going back."
189,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"This is a neighborhood diner that I have been going to for over 40 years. My late parents ate at least one meal per day here every day of their lives. The food is consistantly good whether you go for breakfast, lunch or dinner. I recently went there for dinner with 2 old college friends. I had the soft shell crabs fancese which were the best I have ever had in any restaurant. My friend had a 11/2 pound lobster which was perfectly prepared and my other friend had shrimp Francese ( a special request) which was delicious. My friend who had the lobster liked it so much that she went back a couple days later. Besides the food being great, the owners and staff make you feel like you are family. I love Tibbett Diner."
190,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,This place was super inexpensive and the food was really good. The Santa Fe wrap was awesome because it comes with homemade peach salsa that was fresh and flavorful. Waitress was nice and accommodating. Not too many places in NY where two people can have dinner for $20 and it's more than edible.
191,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"At breakfast here now. Came here hoping the reviews would be proven correct. I am very disappointed. Ordered steak and eggs....the steak had NO FLAVOR. It tastes like they just opened thee rapped  package from the store and threw it on the grill and onto a plate. The potatoes have a weird seafood taste as if they were cooked near some filet or shrimp....gross. And when I asked for my eggs to be remade, they said that they were fine instead of just re-doing them. I NEVER ask for my food to be redone unless it's really bad, so I let it slide, but come on... Don't make me feel bad for asking. Nice ambience but I won't be coming back."
192,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,I've been here twice and I've only lived in the neighborhood for 3 days. They have excellent diner food and a wide variety of options.
193,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"So much better than Riverdale diner. Amazing souvlaki, chicken salad club, fish fillet, amazing breakfast burritos!!! When the fries are good, they are good! Also sometimes they have chicken pot pies on Saturday if they have leftovers from Friday..delicious. They have some nice specials too in the middle of the week for lunch. Nice combos (like an added soup to a sandwich meal) for good prices."
194,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Possibly the BEST DINER in New York. Greek owned. Best prices. Best service. Classic diner look. Quick service. Daily Specials. Great Prices.  And excellent food!!! And excellent asset to Riverdale
195,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Great place to get breakfast, although it's always crowded considering they're the most favored diner in the area. Of you're willing to wait a few minutes, it's a great place to grab a bite!"
196,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"The Tibbett Diner is the best diner in the Tri-State area (and we sure do have many of them!) and easily my favorite diner I've ever been to. I have frequented this establishment for over 14 years and every time I go, I know I can get a quality meal for an extremely reasonable price.The food is less like traditional bland diner food and more like a home cooked meal (but even better). Any item on the menu is a great dish, but I would highly recommend trying the burger (which has been consistently voted the best in the Bronx) and the chicken pot pie (which is a Friday special and the best pot pie you will ever have). If you're in the mood for something sweet, the ice cream shakes are fantastic and deserts are top notch too!The owner, Nick Diakakis, is an absolute gentleman and treats his patrons more as friends than he does customers. I've known times where he has made deliveries during severe snow storms or called up long-time customers to make sure they are OK if they hadn't stopped by during their usual time. Plus, talk to him about the Yankees, and you will see there is not anyone who knows more about baseball than he does!If you are ever in the Bronx, do yourself a favor and stop by for a great meal and comforting dining experience. The Tibbett Diner is truly a gem in the heart of Riverdale, Bronx."
197,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"My son has grown up with this place, and we nearly wept after their fire a few years ago, and certainly rejoiced when they re-opened. It's always a pleasure to eat and relax, whether sitting at table, booth, or counter. The typical diner fare is always freshly and quickly served, tasty, abundant, and moderately priced. The specials are deliciously home-cooked. The staff is probably kinder to ""regulars"" than others, but they are polite and efficient to all the diners. While you're dining in, watch how many ""to go"" orders go flying out of the kitchen. Remarkable. The entire place is nice and clean, and they have parking. Breakfast all day. What's not to love?"
198,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Working in the area and needing a place to grub down. I grabbed my trusty crackberry, opened my YELP app and searched ""food."" Tibbett Diner popped up. With so many positive reviews from users, I had to try it. The set up is very old fashioned. A nice retro looking diner along with retro looking customers (I was the youngest customer.) The diner seems to attract the ""senior"" kind, but who gives a....the food is slammin'! Its good, its cheap, its clean....everything you ask for in a diner. Nice job!"
199,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Love this place. Tucked on a side street a gem for the neighborhood. Great classic diner ambience, great food and great prices! The only thing I would say is a negative is that they only deliver within a block radius."
200,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I love this place, service is friendly and prices are right on.  I hate diners - I stay away from them at all costs.  That was until I found this place.To be fair I've only had breakfast and one cheese burger deluxe.  Breakfast is always amazing, their pancakes are some of the best I've ever had.  My girlfriend loves the pancakes and recommends them. The burger I tried was good but I don't think I would order another --- in my mind this is a breakfast joint.I do wish they served better coffee and they offered things like REAL maple syrup and turkey bacon.  But for the price and the quality, it really can't be beat."
201,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I really wasn't expecting much, but this diner surpassed my expectations. Ordered a western omelette, rye toast, and coffee. Boy ordered corned beef hash with over easy eggs and white toast. Both came with a healthy heap of home fries. My omlette was not greasy, not overcooked, and jam packed with fillings. Boy's hash was a little salty and smokey, but good.Really liked the food and loved the modern retro interior. The service was quick and attentive and the tab was cheap.They do have short distance delivery, but if you live further away you can call for a take out order. There is parking, but its limited; small lot and some on street. Family friendly environment, but no big tables for large parties.I strongly recommend this diner to others; I will be back!"
202,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Can't beat the price and quality - ask for Nick, he's awesome and will make you feel right at home."
203,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Best diner in the Riverdale area!! Fresh, homemade soups daily, very generous portions, a good variety of specials and worth the reasonable prices. Their fish dishes are wonderful and I have never been disappointed! My only critique is the parking is awful!!!!!"
204,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I am not normally a big fan of diners. I feel like they usually offer bland renditions of already bland American standards. The Tibbett Diner is the place that has really shown me what a good diner can be. I'm particularly fond of their Italian entrees -- eggplant rollatini, spaghetti bolognese. The tomato sauce is robust! I take it as a good sign that they grow vegetables and herbs out front in the summer. Check it out."
205,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,This is a great boxcar diner with great food and great staff. It's a bit out of the way but it's totally worth the trek (there's some free parking on the side).I guess if I had to recommend something for a first-timer it'd have to be the chicken pot pie. It's really tasty stuff.
206,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,There's nothing like a good ol' fashion New York Diner. Have some french fries with gravy...YUM.
207,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I have been going here once a week for 5 years!!! Everything here tastes amazing, 100% Better than Riverdale Diner(no comparison)!!!"
208,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Favorite diner in the neighborhood.  Good place to have breakfast after a night of unholy drinking.  They have some of the best food I've ever had at a diner.  All meals start with a great basket of fresh bread.  If you ever go try their Greek combo and a milkshake..Both are excellent.
209,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,I come here weekly for breakfast. Always fast and delicious. Just what you'd hope for in a diner.
210,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"pancakes come fluffylike mouth pillows from aboveclouds, so goddam good"
211,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,This place may not look like much from the outside....but the food and service are great!!
212,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,It was closed for several months after a kitchen fire last year but thank goodness it re-opened as retro as ever with one of the best - and cheapest breakfasts - in the area. I go for eggs but the rest looks goodand several people have recommended the burgers & the omnipresentgyros.
213,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Looks straight out of the early 1960's. The  chicken rice soup was clearly homemade and perfect, and the Gyros platter was tasty, with hot fries, hot meat, toasted pita,,,,The Greek salad was fine, but not great. Iced tea was perfect, with no aftertaste (bitterness is a sign of over steeping). This diner clearly has long term clientele, many of whom were ordering additional things to take home after eating there. Prices are reasonable. Gyro platter below $7. Soup $2."
214,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"Love that boxcar look complete with octagenerian crowd. The waitresses, well, they have a bad case of sass-mouth. Yep, the service is brusk and the bus boys do most of the work. But the food? Really, really good. Everything tends to fresh, hot and homemade. One warning: if you're stout of size, the narrow aisles may not be the most accommodating. It is a boxcar, after all! It is worth sucking it in and squeezing through to get a good diner meal.  Be prepared to bring home leftovers."
215,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,Food is always good.   Value because you get a nice portion.  The service is great and the prices are fair.  Shrimp marinar over spaghetti is delish.   The brisket is great and a generous portion.  I love the chicken orzo soup.  It is so flavorful and not like the watered down soups you get elsewhere.  Go and enjoy.  Whay waste money and your tastebuds somewhere else
216,xuMM_EDCM7X4sSN1rVcDXg,"I should have posted this 3 weeks ago, but I thinks it's OK to post now; as I have not stopped thinking about those panckes!!! Light, fluffy, melt in your mouths. Like delicious clouds. We are going there again, and this time I am packing our own (real) maple syrup. Not that 'maple-flavored' stuff that all diners serve. And then it will be perfection.We have only been there for breakfast. The omelet was the usual diner fare, not too flavorful, but satisfying for what it is. The bacon was a generous portion; I think a lot of places are getting chintzy with the  bacon these days. Everything seemed a bit fresher and a little less greasy than other diner breakfasts, which was nice. And of course the price was right!But the pancakes!! I want to go get some right now!!Oh, and the retro diner feel is worth the trip alone. Loved it. Felt like home. Also, has it's own parking, but the lot is very small. But then again, the diner is small, so maybe it works out. We got a spot."
217,noK-g_vIWxN4WAEU0bNmfw,"I haven't had ramen in a while.This is a small seated spot.You have to look for parking on the street.The menu seems limited but the food is packed with flavor.According to the guy working the cashier, they opened recently.It's clean, they accept cards, I didn't see a bathroom but you'll probably have to ask.The food was relatively cheap, $8 for a bowl of beef ramen.  I'll absolutely take that.I posted pictures Enjoy"
218,noK-g_vIWxN4WAEU0bNmfw,"The restaurant just recently opened.  The decor is beautiful and clean with 6 tables.  Food is unique, delicious and reasonable priced.iced sticky rice $6 - 4 stars - please note that this is not on the menu and it is listed on the wall only.  The dish is an eye candy.  The first bite is strange but the taste really grows on you.  It has sticky rice on the bottom with peanut, watermelon, lyche, colorful mochi and black jelly.ginger chicken, rice noodle with soup 紅糟 姜雞 米粉 $7 - 4 stars, another item not on the menu.  Yes, it is red and the chicken is dry but the soup is very flavorful.house beef over rice $8 - 4 stars - really like the flavor and loved the eggsscallion oil noodle $4 - 3 stars - good but I have tasted betteroxtail soup $6 - 4 starsTotal bill is $31 for 3 personsWill definitely come back to try other dishes"
219,noK-g_vIWxN4WAEU0bNmfw,"A new restaurant opened in the spot of an old Chinese restaurant. I ordered the Spicy Beef Noodle soup with braised egg for takeout. Served the broth and noodles/beef in separate bowls, which is key. It was a good portion and price point. Tasty as well (actually the most important thing to know).Definitely will go back to try some of the other dishes.The decor is nice and very clean. Friendly people working there which is always a plus.Unfortunately, it appeared that they had additional items not in the menu, but it was written in Chinese."
220,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Finally a West African flavor with cool vibes and excellent food! This is the spot I never knew I needed in my life. It's communal dining style makes for a comfortable experience that is only enhanced by the excellent food choices. I now LOVE fonio--a healthy alternative to processed rice. I suggest you make it your duty to visit. I plan on going as much as I can.Great for a date or even a group outing. I got the salmon plate with Jollof fonio, beets salad, kelewele and a ginger drink to wash it all down. If you like spicy, flavor and home cooking feel-go there now!Service is great- they answer all your questions about your meal and its origin.Teranga is a vibe all on its own!!"
221,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"A total revelation of an experience!  Huge windows overlooking Central Park, with window seats.A beautiful and varied assortment of dishes, many of them vegetarian and vegan, although some with chicken and fish too.  A bright, open setting, with open seating.  Every dish I tried was prepared with great detail, very fresh ingredients, and distinct from one another.  I love the fact that it is counter service, which means there is no waiting around for servers...you can be eating within a few minutes.  Ever so highly recommended.  Unlike anywhere else."
222,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Ended up here because a friend was visiting NY and set all of her get-togethers around food. As soon as she mentioned that Teranga had Jollof Fonio and Attieke on the menu? I said, ""Girl, I am there! I will see you on Saturday!"" First, as a foodie and a lover of all things African including food, I was really excited to hear about all of the work Chef Pierre Thiam put into developing this place and the menu. When I tell you that he did an incredible job, I mean incroyable!!!! The decor, the music, the choice to set up the food service in ""fast-casual dining"" style. The vibe is informal yet still chic. Now, the place received so much PR that I thought the food might be watered down like a lot of cuisines from Africa and/or Asia but it was not. It was so well seasoned and flavorful. The Ndamba, beet/fonio salad, the black eyed pea salad, the plantains, the attieke, the red ruby rice, the salmon, the jollof rice, the yassa onions and the maffe sauce. O.M.G.  I felt like one of the dishes may have had a little too much salt but I cannot even say that authentically because I enjoyed it so much. I'll have to return and let you all know. My lunch was good I bought a lunch for Sunday as well that ended up having for dinner the next day. Oh, did I mention that the vegan/vegetarian and gluten free meal options are stellar! Not so much for desserts yet but who needs it after such a great meal! I've eaten African food all over the world, on the continent, in people's homes and even in my own and it was pleasing to my tastebuds. Everyone in our group thoroughly enjoyed their meals. One of our friends was asking if they had Uber Eats before he even finished his plate. This was my first trip to the Africa Center so I'll have to go back and when I do I'll time it to eat at It's Teranga. I am excited for the work of Ched Pierre Thiam. He's a visionary, food creative and he's introducing the foods many of us love to new audiences. He continues to evolve and gets better and stronger as the years go by! As you can tell, I'm a food lover and follower but I wouldn't steer you wrong. Visit It's Teranga - grab a bite or take your out of town guests. It's also a great casual date - you could get your food and then go across the street to Central Park. So many reasons to love this place!"
223,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Already love this place even after one visit - the food itself is 4 stars but the service, homey-ness, and general vibe make it an easy 5 stars. We came for lunch around 2pm and all the seats inside (~25 to 30) were still filled, though by the time we got our food there was space again. Between the two of us we tried most of the options. The black eyed peas and fried plantains were delicious, as were the grilled chicken (huge portions and super tender) and yassa sauce. The Liberian red rice, attieke, and beet fonio salad didn't stand out as much but were great accompaniments to the rest. Definitely try the sauces on the table!! The hot sauce was proper HOT, and the shrimp paste one was my absolute favourite. We also ordered both the bissap (hibiscus) and bouye (baobab) juices and loved both of them. I don't even like hibiscus normally but this version was sweeter and more refreshing, and a great complement to the creamier bouye. Seriously, try the bouye juice. There's just something about this place that makes you feel good from the moment you walk in. It's beautifully decorated and has a mix of communal tables, individual tables, and couches/lounge chairs. Staff is also super friendly and we happened to sit next to one guy who was on the team and asked us for feedback. Also, no steam tables in sight here - everything is served from casserole dishes and Dutch ovens, which adds to the feeling of home cooked food. Anyway, I loved it all and will definitely be back."
224,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"In my efforts to get here before the 7 p.m. closing time, I got stuck in a maddening, almost-pulled-out-my-hair 6 train situation... but the food was good enough to make me forget, at least temporarily.I'd always wanted to try Pierre Thiam's food after hearing about him via MOFAD and Anthony Bourdain, so I was thrilled when I found out about Teranga. By 6:30, a lot of great options were already gone like the kelewele (spicy plantains) and plantain and red palm fufu, two things I'd really been looking forward to, as well as the chicken.I got the jollof seasonal bowl, which came with roasted salmon with Moroccan spices, jollof fonio (fonio, a West African grain, cooked in spiced tomato broth), and black eyed pea salad. The guy substituted the original kelewele side with ndambe (sweet potato and black eyed pea stew). The salmon was so tender, and the spices really made the flavors pop. The fonio, salad, and ndambe weren't that memorable on their own, but they were still tasty and definitely complemented the fish. There were sauces you could use to spice up your protein and sides, and those made the dish even better.I also got the bouye juice, made with baobab fruit and coconut, and sombi, a coconut rice and honey-roasted mango pudding. Both were quite sweet, but I still enjoyed them, and they were full to the brim with great coconut flavor."
225,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Great space, wonderful people, the food was hit or miss. The Fufu is absolutely amazing, and I absolutely get why they sell sides of their peanut sauce. The fried plantains were delicious, as was their tomato stewed black eyed peas. But on another dish the sides were bland, including a rather basic black eyed pea salad. The salmon was fine, but nothing special. The Touba Coffee was certainly worth trying; quite bitter and funky, but if that's your thing it's worth trying. It's a good spot, and well worth visiting, perusing their books, and enjoying their lovely space. Definitely try the Fufu, but otherwise don't expect to be blown away by the food."
226,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,Really delicious food and the staff is very helpful! I loved every bit and the price was fair. Chicken was still moist and so flavorful! The fried plantains were spiced unbelievably well!! Also enjoyed the black eyed pea salad and the grain was good too. I'll definitely come back to try the salmon.
227,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"As soon as you walk into this place, you'll feel like you're in Africa (that's if you've been there already)! It's almost like taking a journey into Africa-colorful paintings and designs on the wall, tropical plants, homemade smell of African food and the rhythmic sounds of the drums!This new restaurant (2 months old at the time of this review) is located on the first floor of The Africa Center, across from Central Park. It's a warm, welcoming environment and the staff are super friendly and helpful. They don't mind answering any questions and eager for you to try the delicious food. Menu is entirely gluten free.Everything I had was absolutely delicious-it was so good that I stopped by two days in a row and will return for more :)"
228,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"The new African palace just opened in the Africa Center serving some delicious fast casual bowls and snacks.It was opening day, so definite benefit of the doubt given on all of the food being cool to lukewarm.The flavor of everything was excellent though, so if it were all hot, I could imagine it being a really hearty, satisfying meal.We tried all 3 of the Seasonal Bowls, each of which packs tons of different flavors in every bite. The vegetarian Fu-Fu definitely needs a lot of the great peanut sauce, but the salmon and chicken on their own are excellent.The snacks are great too, so try some of those for a nice sweet to end the meal."
229,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,I've lived next to the Africa center for awhile and when I heard a restaurant opened up in here I had to try it. Never been to an African restaurant before so I wasn't sure what to expect.Contemporary design inside...very nice. I decided not to go on opening day to avoid any crowds so it wasn't crazy when I went. Food was served bowl style kind of like Chipotle. Tried the Yassa Yassa bowl and it was very satisfying. True comfort food like they advertise. Came out hot and fresh as well. Some of the flavors were a little overwhelming for me though. Service was great! Unique spot for sure.
230,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"If you're in New York you need to run  to Teranga, located in the African Center. They are modernizing African food for everyone and doing Chipotle style bowls were you can try several different items.  They have several vegan and gluten free options! We got a bowl with Ndambe (black eyed pea & sweet potato stew), Beets & fonio, plantains, cassava couscous, and a caramelized onion sauce plus the Bissap juice delicious but very sweet. Overall the food was amazing, great price, point and loved the ambiance. It's across the street from Central Park so you can go walk around after your meal!"
231,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Delicious, nicely spiced food with pleasant and helpful staff. The place has a great community vibe. Can have a good meal, chill, and chat with friends in a comfortable welcoming environment."
232,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"I just love the simple, modern  and upbeat decor esp the drawings on the walls , furniture and the corners of ethnic setups of new African style. I think the foods offer varieties of favors which all are rich in fiber, first you select if you want all vegetables, Chicken or Salmon, then different varieties  of vegetables ; salad and grains etc . The drinks are a bit pricy about 30-40% of the entres but many are freshly made with qualities .  There are many  corners and angles all the seats are special designs and communion tables which offer varieties of choices to enjoy the companies of our friends or enticing to make new friends. I'll say, I'll go again for sure,  it's just feel good when you have a nice clean foods for body and mind!. See you there!. Beside it was so close to walk from our hotel @ Northern Lights Mansion ."
233,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Incredible menu! As somebody who is gluten free, this place is heaven. Grew up eating West African food and has consistently been a struggle to find these type of restaurants in the city. Loved it and would highly recommend. Great portions as well! Perfect stop over for a quick date or a pickup to go sit in the park."
234,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"This is more of a hipster African restaurant than an authentic African restaurant, which is fine. The food is okay, but me and my husband prefer authentic Senegalese food. But it's still a nice place to give a try at least once. You might like it."
235,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"While waiting for the Africa Center to open its doors (hopefully soon!!!) I got to enjoy their lovely cafeteria / restaurant Teranga with recipes from Senegal. Great atmosphere takes you to a far away place with food, music, furniture, art and books. I learned that Teranga stands for hospitality and in a larger sense for ""welcome, take a seat, join the fun"" and it did feel that way!"
236,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Teranga gets points for providing a quality, healthy meal for a reasonable price. The menu has lots of different options, and allows you to combine and mix as you wish so you can try a wide variety of dishes. I was slightly underwhelmed by my fu-fu and Ndambe, but the kelewele was soooo good. I live nearby and am glad I went, and it would be a good stop if you are at the Africa Center or nearby."
237,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Delicious, fresh, flavorful food with lots of options, healthy ingredients, interesting drinks. Loved the space, music, decor, interesting books on the shelves. They used tin plates and real silverware, which was nice. Food server was lovely and very informative about the sources and history of the ingredients. Bonus for those who care, they try to make everything dairy free. We will definitely be back. This place is a real gem."
238,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"The food here is good, not great but good. The seating area is on the small side and reminiscent of eating in a cafeteria. The servers are all very pleasant and accommodating."
239,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Came here after reading recent New Yorker review.  I expected food that was exceptional.  Sorry to say that my experience was dissapointing.  I tried 5 different dishes - mostly tasted similar.  Friendly staff, nice space, reasonable"
240,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Came here after reading recent New Yorker review.  I expected food that was exceptional.  Sorry to say that my experience was dissapointing.  I tried 5 different dishes - mostly tasted similar.  Not particulary delicious or interesting.  Friendly staff, nice space, reasonable prices."
241,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"beautiful space, amazing food, kind well informed service, surprisingly affordable prices. Hope they are around for a long time."
242,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Great place! This is our second time there within the past 3 days. The food has amazing flavors and very comforting. The atmosphere is lively and cool. They also have coffee, which was great. I am so happy to have this place just a few blocks from me!"
243,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Amazing food!! Great atmosphere. I wish I could give Teranga 10 stars. What an amazing blend of West African cuisines. I had the Salmon, sweet plantain and jollof, so good!! I'm coming back with friends so they can enjoy this gastro goodness at the start of Harlem."
244,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Excellent food, rich in flavor. Many vegan options. Resources are from local organic farmers and smallholder farmers in Africa. Wonderful experience!"
245,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Great for lunch or early dinner. Excellent food and drinks, generous portions, and a friendly atmosphere. Right across from Central Park if you want to take out. I look forward to going back to Teranga and trying more things!"
246,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"The atmosphere and ambiance is wonderful at Teranga. It is beautifully decorated, spacious and shelved with a variety of interesting books featuring writers from the continent. However, I was so so disappointed by the food. I ordered jollof fonio, salmon, egusie, kelewele and mafe. The jollof and salmon was bland and quite cold, the leaves in the egusie didn't seem to be washed properly as there were a lot of gritty bits almost tasting like sand in my mouth. It was also bland. The kelewele was not  kelewele, it wasn't spiced as it is traditionally and moreover was not cut in the small pieces it's supposed to be cut in. They were just regular plantains you could find anywhere. The mafe also tasted like plain peanut butter with oil. It seemed as if it wasn't cooked long enough to develop the depth of flavors that mafe in other Senegalese restaurants usually have. The food in general just didn't taste authentic. On a high note, the bissap was good!"
247,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,Wow. Just wow. Everything we tried here was absolutely delicious! The place itself is beautifully decorated and this was a great surprise at the end of a long stroll through the park. We will definitely be back and soon.
248,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Great experience! Teranga is located in the still-developing Africa Center, but offers plenty of entertainment. A cute cafe offering a variety of African drinks as well as your typical espresso drinks (and they have oat milk !), they also have food that's a must try. Everything is fresh and flavorful and, I'm happy to report, very vegan-friendly! My friend loves the moringa powder drink, very similar to matcha but caffeine-free. While the museum is still developing, there have been changing installations within the cafe itself, as well as a large collection of literature to read. I recommend Queer Africa, as I sat down and promptly read it entirely in one sitting. The staff is friendly and hard-working, checking in on tables often (though it is counter service). There is ample seating and tables, making it a great place to sit down and get work done or just hang out after walking through Central Park. Def recommend for anyone in the area, esp once the museum is open!"
249,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Four of us visited yesterday for lunch; an excellent overall experience.  Great venue with interior African decor, views onto fifth ave, African pottery displays and even African literature to look over while eating.  Liked the cafeteria style of ordering food (I could see what the food looked like, the folks behind the counter knew their stuff and could explain the dishes, even the unusual African drinks).  But of course the best was the food, all so good, freshly made and prepared.  An excellent blend of unique flavors; everything was excellent and fun."
250,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"Really good food. Some is spicy, so watch for that when ordering (ask them; they'll explain all the foods to you!). Low key. We loved it!"
251,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,The food was great and price was reasonable. Only problem was that the meal was cold.
252,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"From the moment you enter, you want to stay.  It's that comfortable.  Endless combinations of tasty, healthy, authentic African dishes and sauces will keep you coming back.  Did I mention -- it's all gluten free!"
253,uwj3FOQ0ucGOxk3vBXaBCg,"We ate dinner here yesterday and just loved it! It's a very relaxed and beautiful place to explore the cuisine of Senegal, which I find delicious, lighthanded and healthy. My husband got the thieboudjienne, considered the national dish of Senegal, which is served on weekends, and the fish was delicious and fresh, cooked with a tomato sauce (of course, I took a bite). My son got the grilled chicken with carmelized onion sauce and plantain fufu, with peanut sauce. I got the cassava fufu, with peanut sauce, chicken, fermented couscous and the absolutely delicious red beets and fonio salad. (I find fonio to be the real standout of Senegalese cuisines--its light grainy flavor goes so well with fresh vegetables and fruits. My only complaint was that they didn't sell bags of fonio to take home!) The decor is lovely, well lit with gorgeous views of Central Park, and it's a great place also to get a cup of tea or coffee to relax, read, meet with friends, and think. Very welcoming! Can't wait to return."
254,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"I said I'd come back to Tenth Ave and I did! This time with a group of friends for their Sunday brunch.  We arrived and it was a PACKED house so we had to wait to get seated and while the wait was long, we had no problem as we stood by the bar drinking.  Miguel, the owner, came up to me, remembering me from the last Yelp review I left and he thanked me for it and let me know if I needed anything to let me know - his actions proved to me that he takes pride in Tenth Ave and it is shown with how amazing it is in there.Once we were seated, our waiter came to the table with a pitcher of sangria and filled all of our cups and took our orders down.  In the meanwhile, we were all having a good time, dancing and drinking.  I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese for appetizer and it was delicious.  For my entree, I ordered the Chicken and Waffles Sandwich and while I didn't eat MUCH of it because I was full off of the sangria (lol), it did taste great.Our favorite DJ, Werdamouf was there and of course we enjoyed his set.  All in all, Tenth Ave is definitely a great place to be, the ambiance, the people, the atmosphere - Everything is fantastic.  And yes, the air conditioning was working this time - As I said before, I'll be back."
255,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"My husband and I are Uptown Brunch Aficionados & we frequent the area quite often when it comes to going to brunch or a night out for some drinks and hookah.We decided to try out Tenth Ave for brunch since it was a new spot and our favorite DJ, DJ Werdamouf, just happened to be performing there the day of.We made reservations for 3 and we arrived a little late, around 3:20, however, we were seated quickly.  It wasn't very crowded and since it was a new location, I didn't really expect there to be many people.  However, the entrance to the location is downstairs and it looks great, two HUGE doors, then you're taken upstairs into the grandiose of it all.  It was a very nice place.The day of brunch, however, the Air Conditioning wasn't working and it just so happened to be an 85+ degree day in NYC - this is the reason why I decided not to give them 5 stars.We ordered the Shrimp Ceviche as an appetizer and in all honesty, it wasn't that good, I ate it because I was hungry but for some reason it tasted more earthy than seafood-y and it lacked flavor even salt could've saved the dish and perhaps a little lime for acidity.We ordered the Chimi Burger as our main meal and they redeemed themselves with it because it was absolutely DELICIOUS!  They surprised us with a little dessert of a flan which tasted very good.We drank Mimosas and Sangria which were just OKAY, they weren't very strong but they did taste good.All in All - I will be back, I'm sure the air conditioning not working was just a one-off thing and I'll just steer away from the shrimp ceviche.  The experience was great and definitely worth it."
256,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"Came to tenth ave rooftop with my wife. We ordered one chimi pizza pie which took about 30 mins to order and an extra 30 minutes to be served. When the waitress gave me the check , I then proceeded to give them my apple credit card which has a chip and magnetic swipe bar. Then the waitress asked me for my ID which is normal but then disappeared with my ID which is unheard of. She left with my card and ID for over 30 minutes so I had to look for her all over the lounge but she was nowhere to be found. So naturally, I became worried because she had disappeared for so long with my info. I finally see her pop out of their back room so I asked her where my card and ID were and she replied with "" I'm sorry but I had to make a photocopy of your ID and credit card."" So I then asked for the manager and asked him why the waitress made a copy of my info and he replied with ""we do that to protect you and us from chargebacks"". However , that doesn't protect ME from them committing fraud against me! He then proceeded to say he wouldn't take my apple credit card because there are no numbers on the card. I then gave them another credit card and the same manager asked the waitress to make another photocopy of my information. I highly recommend anyone entering this establishment to only pay in cash as per the management and staff are defrauding customers.Ps. Pizza was cold and soggy and drinks are overpriced and hopefully my identity won't get stolen from Tenth Ave Rooftop Bar!Pss. They do not provide an itemized receipt, which they cleverly include a 15% service charge   AND expect you to tip more for their mediocre service !"
257,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"Came for a birthday brunch with a reservation for 26 people on a Sunday. Atmosphere and aesthetics: 10/10- very cute and trendy rustic touches to this rooftop! I really appreciate the multitude of photo-op places in the rooftop from a wall with cool backlight to a tower of champagne bottles to the sliding barn door on one of the bathroomsBrunch music: 10/10- DJ played a great mix of 2000s and current hip hop/r&b, reggaeron, reggae Food: 6/10- brunch menu includes 1 app and 1 entree- limited vegetarian and vegan options (only 1 actually)- I had the Caesar salad as my vegetarian appetizer, which was tasty and decently portioned- I had the vegan burger as my entree- the patty was NOT served with caramelized onion as advertised, and was just decent to be honest.. it also came with about 10 veggie chips .. come on do you really think that is going to fill a plant-based person? - a person at my table ordered the salmon which wasn't cooked all the way therefore some parts of it were rawDrinks: 6/10- unlimited brunch cocktails are for 1.5 hours during the brunch- mimosas or sangria (red or white) are your options and the mimosas weren't strong AT ALL Customer service: 4/10- was told to come in at 12pm instead of 1pm to accommodate a party of 26 .. was told that we would be seated when half the party arrived .. once half the party arrived, was told we had to wait for the whole party to arrive .. once seated, took almost 10 minutes for the table to be brought water .. overall seemed like the place wasn't ready to open until 1pm even though we arrived 1 hour earlier - brunch cocktail canisters were refilled pretty promptly- most of the food came out at the same time - staff was nice and generally prompt - hookah man told me the hookah was $40 but told my other friends the hookah was $35 (trying to rip me off) Overall experience: 7/10Would definitely come here just because the music and vibes were good. However I wouldn't recommend a vegetarian to come here. I also would recommend to bring cash because it's easier to split with a large group. Also the hookah is $35 and cash is only accepted for hookah."
258,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"I came here on Tuesday, after work, with some friends... what a disaster.We wanted to celebrate TACO TUESDAY!!! When we arrived, we were told that they only have the rooftop open on weekends! So, we ended up sitting downstairs (entrance floor). The drinks were SUPER BASIC/WEAK.The entrance floor has a nice style IDEA; I get what they were trying to pull off... however, the concept was not carried out neatly. Oh, and the bathroom does not have a mirror- WHAT IN THE WORLD WERE THEY THINKING!? ** We ended up hitting another spot."
259,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"This decor of this place is really nice. I like the set up and the glass (?) ceiling. It was pretty empty when I went, but they're still new. I'm sure when people find out about this place it'll be hard to get a reservation. The food was great. I had the shrimp ceviche as my appetizer. It was great. I had the steak and eggs for my main course and that was delicious. Steak was cooked perfect to order and the eggs were great. They had a little flavor to them which I enjoyed. Most place just give you bland & dry scrambled eggs. I asked for fingerling potatoes with my meal and they were great as well. The servers were nice as well. We had the mimosa and sangria and both tasted great. They also have a pizza shop downstairs, so I'll definitely be going back to try that. I can't wait to see this place grow."
260,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,Loved the food (was here for the brunch).Had steak and eggs. Plus our waitress was incredible. She was very generous with the mimosas and the attention to our table of 8. Had to take two stars off for the hookah service though. First the hookah was cracked and filled with a dirty water base. It was replaced but no offer of compensation for the inconvenience. Then As the only man in the group the hookah server assumed i was paying for it. He said it was cash only and separate from the regular check. In addition he also charged me for the charcoal refill. I paid just to not make it awkward for the table but it left a terrible impression.
261,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"I just had a taste of their brunch menu and wow! The steak and eggs were perfectly done. My boo had the salmon with sauté potatoes and it was also delicious. Fast, good service and music was on point. Looking forward to what this venue has to offer. So far, sooo goood! Keep it up!"
262,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"What an amazing grand opening! It was a different vibe, very classy and great service. The staff were great and very attentive. This is the spot to go to for any occasion; birthdays, graduations, or just a night out with your girls. I would recommend it to anyone (day time or night time). So many details through out the space, and a beautiful bar with sheik details from corner to corner. Anyone that wants to go uptown, and still have the down town service and experience this is the place to go!"
263,gSl_voDj9xLXweSTix5OsA,"I got to check this place out during a Pizza and Champagne event last night. It was a really great time! The vibe was on point as was the food.My girls and I had the calamari, the wings, the Chimi pizza, and we were also able to custom make our own pizza which was nice. Everything had great flavor. The staff is awesome- super friendly bartenders making delicious drinks and great convo, and the owners are sure to show their faces and ask for your thoughts and opinions which is really important! Not to mention this is all just the downstairs portion. Upstairs is where they have the club which is absolutely beautiful! Great decor, great lighting, a retractible roof! I was able to enjoy the food portion, but I certainly will check out the after hours events at the club as well!This spot opened up just in time for a memorable summer in NYC. I highly recommend checking this place out!"
264,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,At one time I worked in the area and I never had a bad pizza there that was many years ago I went there recently and the pizza was the same big and tasty if you go there you will see what I mean Enjoy
265,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,Lived in the neighborhood over 25 years and this is still the best pizza around!!!  HUUUUGE slices!  A REAL NYC Pizzeria!!
266,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Although the pizzas are larger than most, the taste does not match in grandeur. The cost has also went up to $3.50 which is a $1.00 up from someone who last reviewed this location. For a few dollars I'd rather go across the street and buy Spanish food."
267,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Workers are sleazy and annoying, sorry not sorry. Like they will catcall any female thing. Anyway, their pizza is actually amazing but pricey."
268,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"I stopped by with a few family members one Saturday.The shop itself is small, clean but nothing fancy. The service is fairly prompt and the slices are huge especially at the price of $3.00. Extra toppings are $1.00.The pizza was the not the greatest in my opinion but my nephews loved it. The crust was a bit to thick for me and it wasn't as cheesy as I expected but I guess that's why the price is so low. However, the one slice will definitely fill you up because it is huge! I'll definitely be back with my nephews because it takes a lot to fill there bellies but this pizza shop had no problem helping me to do that without me leaving broke."
269,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"I've always heard about this place, but being a Brooklynite I wasn't going all the way to the Bronx for a slice of pizza.Question: How did I make it here?Answer: I work in the area.I mean a slice bigger than your head for $3, you can't beat that!Slice so big it doesn't even fit on a plate.When it's about to be payday and you're scraping together money to feed yourself, at least if I come here.. I'll be full until I get home from work."
270,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,Good slice of piazza. Very big and filling slice. Have been a neighborhood staple for as long as I can remember.
271,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"This is by far the most unexpectedly good pizza I've ever had. Does not even need any toppings! And the Slices are not big, they are gigantic!"
272,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,Disgusting and very disrespectful workers! Make sure you understand spanish coz they will call you names just to make fun of you. I am never going back to this place again!
273,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Nice thin crust, sauce had a good flavor and just the right amount of cheese. Super huge slice"
274,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"The location is on a convenient spot in Westchester Square. The pizza here is really huge and tasty. The pizza guy is very polite. Unfortunately I will not return to this place after last night. As I was eating (at the pizzeria) my yummy pizza, my son pointed to my silver plate and noticed something small moving on its back. I took a good look at it and noticed that it was a maggot. We stopped eating and I showed it to the pizza guy. He said very nonchalantly that it wasn't on the pizza. I asked where did it come from. He responded by stating that maybe it fell from the ceiling. I asked him if that was okay. He just shrugged his shoulders and I left. I've never experienced anything like this before. I can't get the image out of my head. I regret not taking a picture but I will be contacting USDA."
275,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"The BEST freaking pizza in New York! It is the biggest slices that are baked to perfection, and deliciousness with each bite! Plus this place has the slices for $3/each!!! Seriously such a steal! I can't wait to go back!!!"
276,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Ljubos has huge pizza for $3. It's as simple as that, it's delicious and I recommend this place to everyone. I travel to get pizza here instead of going to a pizzeria closer to my house."
277,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,3.5 starsPizzas are so jumbo I can't even believe it sometimes. Worth going in if you are hungry. A slice could fill you up. Good old school hole-in-the wall type pizzeria. Simple.
278,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Yes....they have GIANT slices, BUT don't think the food will be tasteless. Expect the crust to be soft but the crispy pizza is a unique balance. CASH only!!! Frugal foodie go-to in a prime location."
279,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,Huge slices that are pretty thin and delicious for three dollars (1$ extra w/topping) you will have a satisfying lunch.They have skimped on the cheese over the years but I still enjoy my slice with pepperoni- the sauce and the crisp dough seal the deal for me. One slice here is pretty much like ordering two from anywhere else.
280,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"One of the best slices of pizza in The Bronx! I have been a customer for 25 years.I've since moved from New York and whenever I return I go out of my way to head to The Bronx and get a slice - Alright, more like a whole pie - to cover the 5 hour drive home. Between this place and Sal's (which burned down about 7-8 years ago) my life was filled with great pizza.  These are the largest slices you will find! Perfect flavor, crust and balance. Easily a top 2-3 for me. Every slice of LJubo's is a slice of nostalgia.  While the owner appears to no longer work... the recipe and the memories remain."
281,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Pizza is not bad, not great. Menu is limited. The reason I'm giving this place a low rating is because they don't wear gloves. The few times I've gone I've seen the same unsanitary behavior. They handle the pizza and money with the same bare hands (no washing in between).  Recently encountered one worker cutting pepperoni with no gloves on, then he attended customers, handled money and went back to cutting without gloves.  Will not be going back there. You have been warned."
282,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"One the best pizza in NYC. The pizza is so big, thick and taste great for $3.00 dollars. I wish there more location like this one all over the city."
283,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,I love this place. Their pizza is tasty and huge. I've been coming here since I lived in the area and attended Lehman HS. Every time after leaving school on my way home I would stop by the shop to grab me a slice. Hands downs this pizza is one of the best in the BX.
284,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Overrated - the only reason people like this place is because they have big slices. Big deal the pizza  is big, it doesn't taste that good and it's sloppy. I guess it's good if you're a student and want a cheap lunch that might fill you up, but IMO it doesn't taste good."
285,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"i love going to this pizza shop. they have huge pizza slices. only time i go to this place is when i have to take my son to his doctor's appointments, or when i'm in westchester square for anything i need  to do over there. best pizza place EVER"
286,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Don't ask me how the name is pronounced.""El Jubo?""""Luh Jubo?""""Jubo?""My brother bragged about the size of their slices for years. I decided to try it out on an early Saturday afternoon. Inside the store front is a small narrow corridor with a bunch of stools, where you can stare at yourself while eating your pizza.For $2.50 you get a large slice; it's not a joke (see photos). It tastes pretty copasetic; would it win best pizza in NYC? No. Largest pizza in NYC? Possibly. You should see the pies. They are so big they spill out of the boxes.Considering the rising cost of wheat, pizza prices will rise everywhere. I could see this place being very busy during the week (ie Lehman high school students and those who work in the area). I like the fact that their slices illustrate good value.The meter maids in Westchester Square are on foot and are always on the move. Be sure to feed the meter or have a friend move your double-parked car. I saw an excited customer leaving with a pizza pie turn his smile upside down as he got a parking ticket.IFHTP 3+"
287,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Love this place. Simple, not fancy, only sells the basics. Not trying to add full restaurant items. Like the way it was when I was growing up. The difference is that the slices are HUGE (sorta the size of two slices) and not thin thin slices, they're traditional Bronx thickness. The price, $3.00 a slice, is a bargain. The taste and the slice itself are great. I find by the time I get to the crust, I'm full."
288,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Great tasting pizza, absolutely huge slices, only $3 per slice...The owner and staff are very friendly...One of the best in the Bronx."
289,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"This place is just okay as far as pizza goes. I found this place by accident - I almost walked out when I saw the price of one slice. I decided to just look over the counter to see how the pizza looks; I couldn't believe my eyes! I've had a lot of pizza in my day, but I've never seen a slice this big. It took me 10 minutes to eat the whole thing. It wasn't particularly tasty, but not terrible (better than the other pizzeria down the street however). This is really a 3.5 star slice, but I can't give half star ratings. I would have given it four, but the sauce and cheese had no distinct flavor. I'd come again just to show someone else how large their slices are."
290,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"This place had been around for many years. I remember when I was a Lehman student going here for slices. One slice would fill me up for a while. These are the Jumbo Jumbo's of The Bronx. I don't know of any other place that makes bigger slices then them AND keeps the prices low at $2.50 a slice. Not the best pizza in The Bronx, but I'd say the Biggest Pizza in The Bronx! *They get Five Stars for having Jumbo Slices for $2.50*"
291,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"Huge slices for $3, thin and crisp like a New York pizza should be. The owners are friendly and work fast!"
292,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,This place used to be good years ago. Theslices are all bread and no cheese. Thepizza used to be steaming hot and servicewith a smile. Now it makes the customersfeel like they owe something as soon as you walk in.
293,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,Affectionately known by us locals as LaJumbos when clearly it's not spelled that way they have provided ten years of great Huge Pizzas. I met a random stranger today in the city and they knew of LaJumbos and didn't even live in the Bronx. Now that's good pizza. Keep up the good work. My only suggestion is you should be open 24 hours!
294,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,I don't know who they trying to fool at the PIZZA shop ... me and my son have been going here every saturday for 2 years ... now it looks like the owners son was there and the slices are smaller and he didn't make my slice hot enough when I asked ... and still they're charging the same price ... I told my parents and friends about this place and they go there ... looks like WE are going to go elsewhere for PIZZA ... CROSS BRONX PIZZA isn't far from there .. so we'll go there instead ...or to FRANKIE'S ... nice going Ljubo's ... and good luck on fooling your other patrons with smaller slices for the same price
295,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"My go-to place for pizza when I'm in the neighborhood. These are TEXAS-SIZED slices (no diss to the Bronx, but these are HUGE). Tasty, straight-forward, satisfying and you can't beat the price, especially in light of the size."
296,5oQBuResjp-Rs_1ys5EH0A,"How could anybody say this place is horrible? Look at the size of the pizza! Also, the perfect ratio of dough and crispy and cheese to sauce."
297,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"My dad and I came to Hometown Dumpling and had a great time! It was surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch, but the owner of the restaurant was greeting everyone and walking around talking to and helping all of the diners along with the waiter. The owner told us that their home recipes were from her grandmother!We started with a generous portion of complimentary japchae noodles with vegetables. Then, we ordered a beef bibimbap and the shrimp dumplings lunch specials. As she and the waiter were bringing out our dishes, the owner asked us whether we were planning on sharing (which we were), and she brought out new dishes for us to use.The bibimbap came as a large bowl of beef with vegetables (bean sprouts, mushrooms, sliced carrots, some sort of spiralized vegetable, beef, fresh cucumbers, cucumber salad, and spinach) and a sunny-side-up egg with gochujang and a bowl of rice for each of us on the side. The dumplings were served with potatoes and a salad and came with soy sauce, and then furthermore, we received cucumber salad, kimchi, pickled cabbage. It was a really nice spread of refreshing food that was tasty but not too heavy--perfect for a hot day! (Next time, I might get the shrimp dumplings steamed rather than fried because the filling is flavorful enough that they probably don't need an oil-fried exterior to be delicious.) The portions were so generous that we wound up taking a bunch of food home, and our waiter packaged everything up separately and neatly for us.We actually came to Hometown Dumpling to scope it out as a potential place to get food to bring to my grandparents, and it definitely passed the test. I would recommend this place for a tasty, (reasonably) healthy meal--just come hungry or be prepared to save leftovers! :)"
298,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Fantastic service and food was delicious. Shrimp dumplings are awesome! We were served a great selection of kimchi's and complimentary potato noodle salad. We also ordered the crispy anchovies, which was also very delicious and worth trying. We are definitely coming back for a bibimbab. People next to us ordered the bibimbab and I had extreme food envy. This place is a gem. Highly recommend."
299,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"The dumplings were awwwwwesome!! Yeah! We also really enjoyed their chicken noodle soup. The noodles were really smooth, the broth had a great flavor, and the chicken was amazing!Pancakes pancakes pancakes yummy seafood yummy pancakes yummy seafood pancakes yummy"
300,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Came with a friend who was in town. We had a nice time and the service was great. The waiter brought over complementary japchae and I tried the steamed beef dumplings. They were cooked very well and I enjoyed the sauce they served it with. Looking forward to coming back again to try other menu items :)
301,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I really enjoyed my experience here! I got the shrimp dumplings for lunch and they were amazing! I was looking for a dumpling place that makes dumplings Korean-style and this place was just that. The lunch special came with japchae, kimchi, and rice. I highly recommend this place if you're a dumpling lover, but they also have other Korean/Asian fusion dishes as well. They also have vegetarian options! Definitely coming back here!"
302,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Solid service here. From start to finish the lady who sat and served us was friendly and attentive. It's a nice clean interior/atmosphere which makes you wanna dine in. We went during lunch since its much more affordable compared to dinner. We got the mild and spicy kimchi, jap chae, and mung bean pancakes to start. The mild kimchi was delicious. Had a good sour pickled taste that went well with the fried mung bean pancakes and friend beef dumpling. The mung bean pancakes were good too. Sizzling hot and had lots of veggies in it, since a lot of stores that sell it usually only add minimal veggies with lots of batter instead. For dumplings we got the day's special dumping which were steamed chicken dumplings and we also got fried beef dumplings. We thought fried would mean pan sauteed but they were actually deep fried which made them extra crispy. We liked the steamed chicken dumplings the least. They were a bit too goopy/mushy in texture and didn't really taste like chicken. We can't really describe what it tasted like. The beef dumplings were good. I only saw beef and chives in it, but there are more ingredient listed on the menu.I personally thought both dumplings were under-seasoned, but in a good way in that it didn't taste like the main ingredient was msg. The food here tastes healthy and homemade by mom. We plan to go back to try the noodle soup dishes and the shrimp dumplings once the weather becomes cooler."
303,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Pretty authentic Korean food.  Can't go wrong with the yookgejang. The dumplings are very tasty and definitely home made.  Highly recommend you try it out instead of going to Ktown.  For those who know - JMT
304,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Decided to call this place for delivery based on other reviews here. I called and the woman on the phone was very pleasant. She took my order and I was looking forward to trying my beef dumplings and seafood pancakes.Now a twist in the story; they call up from the lobby to tell me my delivery is here. I go to the door and after 5 minutes I'm wondering where the delivery guy is. Finally a loud short spanish speaking guy steps off the elevator while having a loud conversation on his phone and without making eye contact with me or pausing his conversation hands me my receipt. A little amused I just stood there and looked at him while he kept talking on the phone never looking at me. Finally I tell him talk lower and gave him the money.I open my bag and see I didn't have the order that I ordered. I found out this preoccupied delivery guy grabbed the wrong order.Why the 5 stars: when I called the restaurant they had already realized what had happened and were already sending out my proper order with a woman on staff.They handled the situation with grace and professionalism. My beef dumplings and seafood pancakes were excellent. Very impressed with this place and will become a regular.(I won't order delivery until I find out they got rid of the very lackadaisical delivery guy)
305,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Went here a second time and had the fried beef dumplings. The dish came with complimentary glass noodles, rice, and sides of fried potatoes and a vegetable salad. While better than my previous experience and I found the dumplings quite tasty on their friends version, it still seemed a rather disjointed meal that suffers from attempting to give too many disparate elements and nothing really made me say ""this is delicious""."
306,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Very nice location and setting that unfortunately garnishes fairly terrible food.  I had their bento box, and this was a mistake, as it's just a mess of random foods that don't go well together at all, with the worst embarassment being some kind of small piece of tuna sandwich, which is pretty much the opposite of what I want with dumplings.  I'm probably going to try this again with one of the purely Korean dishes to see if their Korean food is decent but so far unimpressed.The staff seemed intelligent and responsive, if a little inexperienced."
307,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Awesome dumplings. Tasty bibimbap. Terrific service. Health and environmentally conscious menu. Nice interiors. Best Korean in UES.
308,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Excellent authentic Korean food with incredibly welcoming hosts. Wish it were in our neighborhood.No nonsense. Excellent.
309,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I love this place. Their fried beef dumplings are amazing, not to mention the vegan ones! You get a lot of extra food with your dumplings (fried potatoes, salad and amazing kimchi). Also, great service!"
310,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Super delicious, and very friendly, prompt service. Love that this place opened up here. Everything is fresh, and so clean inside. Take out is also great!"
311,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I cannot praise this place enough! Food is so delicious. Prices are so reasonable. Service is lovely and accommodating. The decor is minimalist but comfortable. If this place is in your neighborhood, don't wait a minute! Lovely vegan options. Dumplings are succulent and perfectly cooked. Kim chee is fiery and fresh. We were looking for someplace halfway between Riverdale and Park Slope, and Hometown Dumplings is perfect!"
312,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Amazing dumplings and love the sides. The bean pancakes are also yummy. Had a beef soup which was tasty but they forgot to add the noodles. The selection menu is a little hard to follow.
313,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"This is a cute little family-run business serving delicious home style dumplings and Korean classics like bibimbap. The restaurant interior is clean, bright and modern and the service is very good, particularly with the female owner making sure everything is to the diner's liking. I ordered the beef dumpling noodle soup, which comes in a tasty broth filled with 5 dumplings, shredded beef, sliced shiitake mushrooms and some glass noodles. The dumplings were delicious, with a firm but silky texture and a tender beef filling. The dish was accompanied by kimchi (I ordered the spicy one, which is mildly spicy by Asian standards) and either roasted diced potato's (regular and sweet) or rice. Overall at $14, it was great value for dinner of this quality. The same dish costs $12 at lunchtime. The owner told me they make small batches of dumplings each time so that they're fresh. This is a great addition to the Yorkville neighbourhood and I look forward to trying their other dishes!"
314,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Hometown dumplings is incredible and a great addition to the neighborhood. It's a mom and pop establishment, they are very nice, and make wonderful food. The appetizers are delicious. We got the kimchi's and seafood pancake . We also had the beef and shrimp dumpling and they were solid! Looking forward to eating here again!"
315,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,I had no expectations trying this place just hoping for good dumplings. The moment I walked in everyone was so friendly! It's very clean I loved they were playing calm instrumental music. We started out with mung bean pancakes they were perfection! Crispy and savory. I ordered the fried vegan dumplings.......... wow!!!! I was just expecting a couple dumplings to my surprise there was an edamame side salad as well as sweet potato and regular potatoes. No joke the dumplings were incredible!!!!!!!!! The best I've ever had! Perfectly fried not oily at all and there veggies were perfect!! My boyfriend had the steamed shrimp dumplings and raved about them as well! The service was great. Everyone was so pleasant. I will 100% be going back!!! Highly highly recommend this place!
316,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Nice small place. Korean traditional food. Owner is very nice. More for a lunch than for a dinner. I would definitely recommend this place.
317,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I discovered this restaurant a few weeks ago, the first thing I noticed was the clean modern interior. The staff is extremely friendly and attentive, and the food is amazing and plentiful. I have tried the beef dumpling soup and the vegan dumpling soup, the jap chae, and the seaweed/ spinach salad. All were extremely flavorful and well seasoned. I will definitely be back to try the chicken soup next. Great addition to the neighborhood!"
318,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Tried this place for the first time tonight and really enjoyed it! They sent out complimentary noodles and kimchi to start. They were helpful with the menu and making recommendations. The beef dumplings and bibimbap were delicious and they were great with our toddler. Will be back!
319,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,This place serves Wonderful food!  Everything is fresh and clean.  The owner is a lovely woman who works incredibly hard.  So happy they are open :)
320,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I order from here at least once a week. The food here is really good. Fresh, clean and obviously homemade. Portions a very big. I am so happy that we finally have a great Korean restaurant in the hood."
321,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Got the steamed beef dumplings. They were great and came with a mix of vegetables not just potato which I love.
322,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Great find on the UES. Delicious Korean eats with a homemade twist and friendly staff. We tried the shrimp dumplings, beef dumpling soup, and bibimbap and found each tasty and unique. We will definitely be back!"
323,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"I appreciated the super friendly service. The seafood pancakes were delicious and authentic- crispy in the outside, chewy and flavorful on the inside. We ordered the beef dumplings steamed (have the option to get them fried or steamed) and loved them. This will definitely be our new neighborhood spot."
324,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,Great new addition to neighborhood! Fresh food and great service! Dumplings were great and generous portions.
325,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,This place is terrible   I was looking forward to my meal but the garbage enjoyed more than i did. The dumplings where great looking but extremely doughy with no flavor at all and then the korean chicken resembled leftovers that someone tossed in a takeout container with no style and flavor. If you want a bad meal then i would recommend eating here.
326,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"The dumplings are about a 3 star. Appreciate that it's homemade but nothing special. I ordered jap chae and it was sour! I don't know if they pre make it and leave it out in room temperature but it was definitely not edible. My coworkers said something smelled sour and while I didn't think it was my food, I took a bite and it was sour. I immediately threw it out. Will not be ordering from here again."
327,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"Food and service are as good as it gets. The dining area is clean, bright, and minimalist in a very appealing way. And it's quiet -- just a perfect place to have a conversation over a nice dinner. My wife is vegetarian and they had many wonderful vegetarian (vegan, actually) options on the menu. They have a small selection of beer and wine but the choices were good and covered the full spectrum of tastes. Among the three of us, we had the (vegetarian) bibimbop, (steamed) beef dumplings, and bulgogi (grilled shredded ribeye). All three dishes were spot on. The spicy options (the red pepper sauce and the kimchi) are medium-hot by American tastes, so go with those unless you have no tolerance for hot food whatsoever. The dinner came with glass noodles, kimchi, and a choice of white or brown rice. Every time a dish went by or we glanced at another table, we had food-envy. We will definitely have to try one of the pancakes or soups on our next visit."
328,2vTsVfRk_j6EX6ORkz_M-Q,"rip off...so disappointed. $15 for dumplings just because they give you boiled potatoes and minced veggies? and can't just get dumplings by themselves? dumpling wrapper is good but insides are low on protein, high on minced filling....was hoping we could get a ""Flushing type"" dumpling spot. Where the dumplings are FAN-tastic! I suggest they create a well priced dumpling selection and they will see more people interested!"
329,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"So in love with this neighborhood spot! Great service, fresh food & they remember regulars... I've been visiting at least twice a month since March 2019 & look forward to going each time. Especially on Lobster Night (Thursday)!!!"
330,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I've been here exactly 1 time. I used to live in Midtown Manhattan and going to Pasty's on 34th street was the thing for me. So when I moved into the neighborhood I expected to be the same as 34th street. Full of life great vibe and all but to my surprise it was all the opposite. TheStaff are okay, place is clean and the food was not to my liking what so ever!!!I will have to give it another try and see what happens!"
331,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"So i stopped by patsys saturday evening. And i have ro say the place was crowded, The staff had it under control every one was having a,good time. I sat down with my wife and was greeted by the owner who recomended the veal chop it was out of this world my wife had her usual shrimp risotto. It amazes me how this place doesnt have,a,line around the block. That aside i had,a great saturday night. See you guys soon"
332,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Finally made it back to patsys of morris park. I have been dying to get there vut my job hasnt allowed me the pleasure. I needed that inviting sangria and warm welcome i get from the staff.not to mention thr laughs i get from the owner. There is no place other that gives me the feel of home.Thanks John and all the staff
333,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"My favorite spot for ordeing italian food delivery or dinning in .patsys in the bronx the pizza is a must as,an apetizer. I love the warm feeling i get when i sit down. The place is,so cute ut quite often is extremely bz. So waiting 45 minutes for my dood is understandable.The sraff is very friendly and well mannered .If i want something off the menu the manager has no problem doing so.I cant understand gow some of there reviews are so offensive i think if everyone who had a,good experience whould express that in a,review it wgould be overwelming.  There are a lot of rude people in this,world . And,as for the outspoken unsatisfied people in this,world wgo have spoken bad about this establishment sgame on you. There are things that happen that are,simply misgaps,or misunderstandings..Dont believe everything you read patsys of morris park is  a must for me . Where else are you going to fo on a tuesday for a dish of pasta for 10 dollars. Thank you guys for makingvme feel welxome everytime i come."
334,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Another great night at patsys,of morris park.as for the review posted ahead of mine i am disappointed that anyone could possibly complain a bout the service tonight .The staff was trying hard the bar backs attending tge tables were so polite and tge owner was paying close attention to all the tables ,I mysef ordered my favorite the risotto with shrimo and was very hapoy with my dish, my date ordered the chicken francese she was taken back by the tasteful dish .The owner brought capuchino and the famous tiramisu, thank u John for a wonderful evening , i whould always,recommend patsys Morris park.,Always,leave this place with a,smile very family orientated and great music."
335,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Patsys pizza of Morris park ave wow,the placecwas jammed pack the music was just as good as the food .what an experience the staff eas,trying hard to keep up you sont mind the waite when u see the amount of people in tbe resraunt. The owner  walked me to my table aa always and asked me what kind of wine i drank. I told him the usual so he went out of his eay to bring our drinks to the table personaly . The staff was doing thr best they could, the music playing in the background was,just as good as the food. I ordered sole francese andcmy wife i had seafood rissotto . Patsys of morris park is rated 5 star in my book another evening a,great success. .  Thank u john and the staff of patsys."
336,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I have to say again . Patsys is one of my favorite werkend stops . I sat down with my wife and children, and eas greeted by the manager who offered to make me a special order of parpadelle pasta with sauteed calamari and fresh tomatoes.  I wae certainly not disapointed again. Thank you patsys for a,wonderful evening."
337,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Good evening home from a hard and stressful day at work in Manhattan so i stop by patsys of morris park for a night cap.ThE manager being so concerned with my distressed look offers to oick me out an entree fish being my favorite which i informed him. After another drink at the bar while i was unwinding a beautiful pasta fish dish came before me my day was now saved by patsys manager being so thoughtful. Although he looked like he was having a,tough day himself ,he still dound the time for me. I now dound my sexond home patsys of morris park"
338,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I just ordered a pizza. Traditional pie nothing special. I figure if a regular traditional pie is executed properly I'll definitely try other food items. Got my pie through the DoorDash. Came fairly quickly. Get the pie. I thought the box was empty once I received it. Smelled good though. Go upstairs. Open the box reach for the thinnest slice known to man. And not only was it thin and what it looks like the most cheeseless pizza I seen. It was BURNT!!!   Won't be ordering from there again. Waste of money!!!!
339,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"This is a great restaurant that opened a few years back.  My family eats here atleast once a week. They have a great happy hour and a huge menu with delicious food.  They have offer daily food and drink specials.  The owner John is a great guy and well liked by the entire neighborhood.  The staff is great with kids and very accommodating to families.  The price is good, the portions and quality are great.  If your on Morris Park and wondering where to go this should be the place. Plus they have 5% cash back for yelpers.  Thank you Patsys for all of your amazing years of service.  See you soon - The Maceks"
340,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Should have just came here for the pizza. Instead sat for a meal. The pizza here is very good. Nice crispy thin crust that you'd expect from patsys. Unfortunately I didn't get it. Fried calamari was bland and generic like Costco. While the chicken Park was good it was nothing special. Even the penne with vodka sauce was bland. Should have just went to captains down the block. I now know better for next time.
341,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Haven't been here in a long time. Went with family to have a nice meal.Started with small pizza, mussels, octopus. Pizza came out thin, crisp, and so satisfying ! Seafood came out fresh and delicious.For our meals we ordered salmon, shrimp risotto, and penne vodka. There was nothing to complain about. Fish was fresh, the sauce was yummy.Than we all had dessert (forgot the name of the dish). It was a creamy cheese dish that came with fresh fruit and a jelly glaze. Waitress was friendly and gave great service."
342,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I came in here Saturday night for my first time. We ordered pizza and salads. The pizza was very delicious, very thin and crispy. Haven't seen pizza made that thi in a long time. The house salad dressing was delicious, dipped my pizza crust in it.For dessert I had tiramisu, someone told me they make it. If they do, then they nailed it. Tiramisu was Fresh and creamy.For a Saturday night they weren't that busy, but they had a party behind the back doors. The service was to good either. None of us got water refills, lemon for expresso, and waited to ask another worker for a spoon for the dessert.With the food being good, I will try this again."
343,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"This was my 2nd visit here and our server Crystal on this visit was simply wonderful. We stopped in for a late lunch/ early dinner and we were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant had a lite hustle but was still pretty quiet. I was interested in trying something different. So Crystal chatted with us a bit and helped with my indecisiveness and then our orders were placed.I decided on the Chicken and Artichoke w/ tomatoes it was really amazing my bestie ordered her typical pasta and sauce (same ole same ole) lol.Yelp check in offer was complimentary dessert, we picked the NY Style cheesecake. Already stuffed to capacity we couldn't resists a foodie moment to indulge and no regrets. It was well worth every calorie!"
344,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Terrible experience. Worst looking pizza ever. The pie looked days old and stale with about ten crouton sized pieces of chicken. Ordered the pollo alla parmigiana pie which they describe as tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella and sliced house made chicken parmigiana. And evening manager was disrespectful when we called to complain. Gave me immediate refund when I showed up in person for him to see that embarrassment of a meal. I only give them one star because it's the lowest amount allowed."
345,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I used to enjoy Patsys but after tonight I won't order from there again. I just ordered the Chicken PARMASEAN pizza, what a joke! It looks like a something a 5 year old made. The menu description says: Tomato Sauce, Fresh Shredded Mozzarella cheese and sliced house made Chicken PARMASEAN. This is what we got, a plain pie with about 8 tiny pieces of dry cubed chicken cutlet.  Not to mention the manager was rude and insulting when we told him about it. Never again..."
346,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Great service, great food! The pizza is great too! Love having lunch at a traditional Italian food restaurant. Food is so fresh and tasty!"
347,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Good.  ill give it good.. ordered a large plain pie,  $15.  Pizza was excellent. after me and my partner finished, we went to get a sandwich..  I did not try a dinner so i can only comment on what i had.. if im in area again, i may try again for a dinner, may not.  had slice of cake for dessert, $6.  It tasted freezer burnt."
348,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I am so disappointed. The first time I order a delivery from patsy the pizza show up upside down to my house. So I decide it to give them another shot cause my children love their pizza and the pizza show up without basil and tomatoes toppings the I pay extra for and on top of that super cold. Never ordering from this place again!!!!
349,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Horrible Pizza, I ordered the Proschuto del fungi, I got this old proschuto on top! It was very very cold. They literally bought my pizza after 2 and a half hours and when I called them to tell them they were so rude about it. Horrible service and horrible pizza"
350,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Nice thin pizza. Great tasting sauces. The space is inviting for family style meets and eats. There is a full service bar with televisions to watch a game or two. My absolute favorite thing is their desserts...more specifically, their almond cake!!!! Their tiramisu is awesome too and housemade!"
351,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Just order a pizza pie from here using Uber eats. They said it's thin crust but it just taste cheap. Definitely taste like cardboard. Was not worth 15$. The pizza came to my house cold. Very disappointed.
352,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"The food was amazing, in taste and in portion. The service was excellent giving off a family friendly vibe. Definetly recommend the fettucine alfredo with breaded chicken."
353,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"2 Hour Wait for Delivery?  Don't do it!Just ordered as soon as they started accepting online orders -- at 11 -- and the estimated time for delivery is 2 hours!  Calling them, they were borderline unfriendly -- would not order from them again.  Plenty of good food in this part of the Bronx and lots of other good pizza places -- order from somewhere else!"
354,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"So I went there last night with my family, and I never felt so unwelcomed in any establishment as I did last night. Almost regret spending a dollar there. First the service, your servers completely ignored us. When we asked for appetizers the waiter said we couldn't get them unless they were with the meal! What restaurant does this?? Then the appetizers took 45 minutes to arrive. When we got the meal they missed one dish.. the Pizza the most simplest thing!! The waiter took the order for the pizza after we all got our meals. This is not the experience I had from Patsy's at Harlem.. do the public a favor either change the management or just change the brand of this location. Very very very disappointed!!"
355,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Pizza is better than the food but overall this is a good place for Italian food. My grandmother had an issue with credit fraud here, so I would pay in cash."
356,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I ordered from this restaurant through Uber Eats. I paid more than $40 for Shrimp Penne Alla Vodka. I only received three shrimps in each order. Ridiculous.
357,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I came on a Tuesday pasta night , we were a party of 5. Service was slow at first but it was not a crowded night. It was just our family and another couple or two there. It took a while before our water came out. The appetizers we ordered were the stuffed artichokes, fried meatballs and caesar salad were delicious.  I ordered the rigatoni with chicken and peas in a white sauce.  The pasta felt dry and needed more sauce and the chicken was not as flavorful as I thought , I think it was pan fried.  I think next time i'd try one of the other entrees. The tiramisu was delicious!! Definitely a must when you come here. All in all a cute spot in a great location. Very friendly staff."
358,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Really disappointed. Service was terrible. Waited forever for our food. Ordered a veal chop that was fatty and  raw!!!
359,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Honestly love this restaurant, this is me and my moms favorite place to talk the atmosphere here is so peaceful and perfff. Love this place. If you come get the meatballs and the four top pizzza"
360,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Thank you ! Thank you ! My first order ever from this restaurant and it consist of penne vodka, cheesecake,Chicken Parm hero and salad with French fries. A good chunk of my money for a Sunday hangover meal and it was totally worth it!Everything was fresh!  Thank you to the chef and patsy's team!  I almost forgot to mention delivery service was on point. I only waited 20 minutes!     Guys you really made my day! Please don't change anything your already doing right!      I will be ordering again very soon! Best, Luz"
361,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Patsys is one of my favorite pizzerias. I always get a pie of pizza, but whenever I have space for more, every meal I have tried has been just as delicious."
362,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,This is probably the worst pizza I've ever had in my life I've had Pizza Hut even dominos pizza taste better then this trash cardboard pizza with bland sauce on it
363,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,This pizza is not comparable to the Harlem locations. The pizza was typical and I've had better at lil ceasers. I was over charged for a basic pizza. I would have rather traveled to Harlem then wasted money on this place.
364,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I've never been to the Patsy's in Harlem so I can't use it to compare to Patsy's in the Bronx. After dining here for the first time, I feel this place has a lot of potential to roll with the big shots of Italian restaurants in Morris Park and Pelham Gardens. The restaurant has a very clean and open feel to it - there's an impressive counter-seating area as you walk in with the pizza oven in prime view. There's also a back room with more seating that I can easily see being used for private parties.We started with the fried meatballs and arancini. The meatballs came with spicy peppers and garlic and the rice balls were stuffed with cheese and came with marinara sauce on the side. For my main I had the chicken sorrentina style which was a chicken cutlet topped with a  sliced eggplant and prosciutto and mozzarella; it came with a side of mixed veggies and potato croquette. Overall the food was pretty tasty, the apps were good but my main was a little weak. The quality of the chicken wasn't up to standard (though the dish was overall tasty) and the veggies looked like they were from a frozen mix (lots of broccoli stems versus actual broccoli florets). Service was good, everyone was super friendly greeting us as we were entering and leaving - our waitress was very attentive to us. One kink was that it took longer than what is standardly acceptable for our food to come out. There was only one other party in the restaurant when I was there so it was a little unexpected.I've also had the opportunity to try their pizza, which is very good and probably the best thing they put out. They have a lot of different varieties and the crust is super thin (my favorite!). Overall, Patsy's has a lot of potential - it faces a lot of competition in this historically Italian area of the Bronx but if they up the quality of some of their products they'll hopefully gain a following here. I would go back, specifically for the pizza."
365,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Man I wish I read reviews about delivery before I ordered. My ETA was btwn 8:35-8:45. I ordered at 7:30. It is now 9:06 PM and still no food. Now I'm out $30 and starving. I should've ordered dominos instead. They're cheaper and arrive in 30 min.
366,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,DONT EVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!! You will be waiting more than an hour and a half for your food and when you get it it's COLD!!!!!!!!!!. Seriously the WORST take out place. Don't waste your time ordering from here. I'm mad Yelp doesn't let me leave NO stars. This place deserves NO stars for horrible service. HORRIBLE! Will never again order from here.
367,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Never get the order right. Please have them repeat the order back to you and make emphasis on specific things that's want & it's not a regular for them. John is very rude and impatient and inconsiderate. Horrible customers service skill.
368,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Bad service and mediocre food. I'm glad I've never ordered delivery since they seem to have even worse service with their delivery's. Not a place I would recommend to anyone.
369,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"So apparently this place is like a landmark that you have to visit in NY. I never heard about the place until this week when I was offered to have dinner there. I have found my new favorite Italian spot. The way they prepare their Octopus is the best I've ever had, and I love trying the foods I love at different places and that truly was the best. My date and I then shared the fried Ravioli and again great, along with the infamous pizza. Now I'm not a big Pizza fan and didn't try, but it got rave reviews. The location might not be close to me, but I will make the time to go back and try other items on their menu."
370,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Patsy's Pizzeria of Morris Park!! Each Patsy's that I have been to now have had there own style. But one thing I can always count on is their great brick oven pizza!! Perfect thin crispy crust with a great sauce and lots if cheese! I can't really compare this Patsy's with the New Rochelle or Manhattan Patsy's, they all are so different! Morris Park Patsy's is very big starting with a mirrored dining room and bar with brick oven in front to a middle dining area where we sat with a cool ""winery"" display on the wall to a private party room in back. It's appeal is of a vintage pizzeria but elevated tastefully. They just opened 15 months ago. We had a very nice waitress Crystal with a very upbeat can do attitude that was pleasing! Eddie the Manager also was very professional and attentive. I started with the lentil soup that was savory and pungent with herbs! Unfortunately,  the Caprese appetizer was not the best we have had with very hard tasteless mozzarella over tomato slices and a ring of balsamic around the plate. Eddie the manager did inform us they do not make their own mozzarella or pasta in house. Onto the entrees, my Ripini was wonderful with perfectly al dente orecchiette pasta with sautéed broccoli rabe and sweet sausage in oil and garlic. What made this dish perfect to me was the uniformed smaller pieces of sausage and broccoli rabe to match the pasta! The blend was delicious with just enough garlic to make this dish pop!My partners chicken Parmiginia with a side of pasta was huge with lots of mozzarella on top. The piece of chicken was on the thick side, but seasoned and cooked well. The pasta had a lot of sauce, maybe a tad too much, but he did not seem to mind since it was a great robust sauce! As I stated in the beginning, Eddie presented us with the famous Patsy's personal pizza which is a good sized pizza, perfect on every point! The burn on the bottom of the crust was perfect and expected from a good brick pizza oven! My manhattan cocktail was flawless and served in the appropriate martini glass since it was not on the rocks. Dessert went with the lunch special of $17.45 served 11-4 week days. The cannolis were miniature but served in a pair with powered sugar atop. It was the perfect ending to a good meal! Make sure you also check out their happy hour every week day from 4-7 pm in the bar area with 1/2 price drinks!"
371,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"This was our first visit here and we found the food variable.My guess is you are probably best off ordering the pizza.It was Tues., pasta night.  That made the list of pasta dishes rather inexpensive; one of us had pasta with clams.I had the special French onion soup and it was amazingly good - on par with what you would get in a French restaurant.  Unfortunately my chicken sorrentino entrée was disappointing (both the chicken and the mashed potatoes)."
372,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I feel like the food should be better. The name patsy's in NYC speaks to high quality food. I was underwhelmed. I had the ziti and meatballs. The meatballs were a rating of ""store bought quality""  on my scale and the sauce was very acidic and tangy. The pizza was not great. Crust was a little doughy. I would not order from here again."
373,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,First time here and won't be last. Pizza the best. Service very goodIt deserves 5 stars
374,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"A long-term fan of the east harlem location, I was skeptical to try this one, particularly after being let down by the manhattan locations. Turns out, this Patsy's is owned and operated by the proprietors of the establishment of east harlem fame, and that the other locations are franchises. Who knew?! Well- you can somehow taste the difference. The pizza is as good as east harlem, and the pasta, chicken alfredo, which i tried for the first time, was exquisite. Had a peroni- which was ice cold and delicious. The restaurant was almost empty on a saturday afternoon, and the server was not smiley- but he was very friendly. He even let us have some hot sauce out of his 'lunch stash' which was most appreciated. The bill was a little high for the area, but completely reasonable for the food we received which was fresh and oh so scrumptious. Will come back."
375,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Ordered pizza at 6:22pm, pizza didn't  arrive until 8:50 and it was ice cold. Driver ran away from door...maybe an indication that something was wrong. I called restaurant to speak to manger or owner. Young lady came back to phone & said he(John  or Joe was his name)was busy and couldn't come to phone...but he would send me a free pizza the following night. Too busy to talk to an unhappy customer. I have never heard of such foolishness in my life. Very disappointed with the service here. I had to heat pizza in oven....had I wanted to turn on oven I would not have ordered pizza in the beginning. I Don't believe I will  get a free  pizza  tomorrow or trust something hasn't been done to pizza...due to complaint. Won't be ordering from this place again.   It's Friday the day after & they made good on their promise. They delivered a entire pizza to my home along with a slice of cheesecake. All is not forgiven but they did right their wrong."
376,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"The worst management in the industry. It's called hospitality to the old manager. I have been in industry for over twenty years and the manager is by far the worst I have seen or heard. First, it is not respectful to make fun or take negative about your guests. A woman comes in with daughter and spoke negative to her. There is a sign that says wait to be seated. She was waiting to be sat. Manager starts talking negative asking her what do you want and continued to say she is rude and does not stop after he seats her. Than him and his pizza maker wants to make fun of me. Well all I know is I have and will always have a better life than the two of them combined. The manager says he needs to lose 50 pounds.  Hopefully he will lose his mouth in the process. Joe stop yelling all over restaurant. Pizza maker stop touching your dirty phone than touching pizza. Good luck to employees that work there because that is worst leadership I have seen and heard in the industry."
377,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,The service was fantastic and so was the ambiance. As far as the food we should have gone for the pizza since that is what they are known for and everyone seemed to have it on their tables. We had entrees and they were sub-sub par. I think they served me instant mashed potatoes-gross. There was also no bread basket with the olive oil. What kind of Morris Park Italian restaurant is this? Honestly do yourself a favor and go a few blocks down to Captains pizzeria. The only reason we didn't go there today was because we wanted to try something new.
378,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Ordered for the first time... I actually wanted to try the pizza, but my budget wouldn't allow both pizza and what I actally had a taste for...CRISPY CALAMARI... Actually, they gave me the opposite!  My calamari was quite soggy, and flacid... And underseasoned... I also paid for extra marinara sauce and the spicy sauce... However, I only received one of each (so I was jipped of a sauce...) Not only that, but the sauce was placed in the sealed container with the ""crispy"" calamari, and as a result, the steam melted the container, and the sauce was all over my calamari... I also ordered the rice balls, and though they weren't bad, they seemed to lack seasoning... I heard so many good things about the Manhattan location, so I really wanted to give the one in my neighborhood a try... Needless to say, I'm underwhelmed... PB n J tonight!!!"
379,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Delivered pizza was in time, hot and tasty! Thin and crispy, thank you gyes for this pleasure!"
380,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,AwesomePlace awesomePeople everything is 5Star.margarita is one the best I ever had and try Philly cheese  .the service itsAmazing was hot day and want the first table we walk in but the waiter said come inside is better ..wish all the best to this place
381,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Another Italian spot on Morris Park? Yes, another Italian spot. This, doesn't stand out any differently from the others, but is is very, very good. The atmosphere and the pizza is legit. Everything inside is shiny and new. Food came out quick and was devoured even quicker. Just another great spot in a great area."
382,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Found this place while walking around the Bronx looking for a place to eat. I was impressed with look of it inside right away. I was greeted and taken to a table and the friendly staff took care of us quickly. I ordered some appetizers and some drinks, then some pasta and a pizza... everything about the food was good, I would say almost perfect, specially the pizza. The beer selection wasn't the greatest, but they had a couple of imports on draft that were decent.When I checked in on my Yelp app I received a coupon for a free desert, I showed the waitress who said she had to check with her boss. She came back saying that the coupon was for a different location (even though I checked in at this specific location), but they would honor the coupon anyway. My thoughts on this; if you're gonna honor the coupon, just save the comment about it being for a different location, just honor it!Overall it was a great experience and I look forward to trying a different pizza next time!"
383,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Keep it!  We went for an office lunch and it was the most disgusting ""Italian"" nasty food.  Never, never again.  The only saving grace was the kind kind waitress."
384,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Amazing 10/10 recommend. If you're not eating here what are you doing? And have you seen the bus boy? Oooooh.
385,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Once again I find myself here at parsy as i checking in i see i have a free desert for one of my previous post here so that was a big surprise to me i show it to the manager and without a problem he gave me it . I'm always trying something new when I come and so far I have not been disappointed #LoveMeSomePasty
386,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"This my forth time here at. The Morris Park I'm usually here for lunch and I have not been disappointed i get a pie and salad and share it with my wife or whoever is with me at the time. It has a very relaxing atmosphere service has its up and down but not bad at all ,but I'm sure you won't be disappointed with this place"
387,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"The food I had today was great! Not to mention the service which was exceptional, as soon as we walked in the bartender greeted my friends and I, he even offered to make our drinks with love. Our waitress Karyn was great. The manager John is ""the man"". He's so personable and ensures he talks with all of the guest. I ate the Uncle Jay's Carbonara and it was delicious. I definitely will be coming back. Thank you guys."

The wait staff is super fast and helpful. the pizza was delicious as was our wine, soup, octopus and salad.  Can't wait to swing by during the snow days to enjoy the warmth of this little cozy restaurant."
389,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"While it doesn't seem fair that Yelpers are allowed to review an establishment after only one visit, I'm very sure that we won't be going back. With Patricia's three blocks away and Emilio's two, you'd think that they would try to up their game and stand out at this Patsy's but it was lack luster. I have visited the one in Harlem and it is great! When I think of Patsy's (or any neighborhood Italian restaurant), I think of delicious food, good service, and a warm environment. This location seems to have none of those. The food I ordered was bland and cooked way too much, the cheese looked like it was pre cut slices of cheese melted on top, like at a diner. You can really tell when the ingredients are sort of 2nd best when simple things like a sauce or a cheese isn't that good. On a weekend evening at 9pm, we expected to see many other patrons but there was not one single other person. The lights were on too bright for the bar and too dark for the dining area. The music was not appropriate for a place like this and the service was, mediocre. With 9 people staffed, not one of them asked us how the food was or if we needed anything. Save yourselves from your curiosity and walk a few blocks down for a good meal instead."
390,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Although the food was satisfactory, it was very high prised. They completely got my online order wrong. I received a medium pizza when I ordered Large. Ordered 2 cokes got two diet cokes. There pasta would have been good but they used less pasta sauce and allot more butter. Seems this place is ok but only if everything is closed."

392,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"It's down the street from Patricia's and Emilio's, both of which are probably five-star joints as well (I haven't been to Emilio's in centuries), and it's tempting to get all relative about that--it is Morris Park, after all, and Italian places are in no short supply. But on absolute terms, this place provides a service, they do it very well, and I can't think of anything to complain about. Get anything with the sausage on it, or the prosciutto-and-arugula. They actually cook the prosciutto in the oven (under the cheese) rather than stick it raw on top, which I always thought was a little nasty.They had a super-fresh salad in January, too, which is no small feat. I'm not much of a radicchio guy but it was very well-done.As an aside, here's a fun game to play at Bronx pizza joints: Count the Derek Jeter posters. I only saw two at Patsy's, but I'd be surprised if that was all."
393,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"This is place is slightly sentimental for me. My family's bakery was there for 80+ years (Russo Bros.). I mention this because Patsy's was going to have to be pretty damn good for me to five stars on it. They had big shoes top fill!Well, they do not disappoint. Pizza is top notch, and in this neighborhood, that is saying a lot. So much great pizza on Morris Park, and these guys found a niche; thin crust. Very thin, great sauce & cheese. Wonderful pizza!"
394,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Very rarely do I ever give out 5 stars. But this place deserves it. Overall: atmosphere is very good with staff being attentive. The three times I have been here all were superb with service and food. Love the on tap beers they supply which was crisp and cold. Four sections: outside, front, bar and back (with supplemental party room, that Is used when crowded). Service:Was a Hispanic male who was very attentive. He knew a lot about the menu and consistently worked with his back waiter to ensure our party's need were met. Was prompt when we sat,  checked on our Apps and main course and was quick to keep our table free of used items. Manager also came by to check on us. What I liked was there was a table next to us who were friendly to him and offered him a seat. Normally when a location is empty, employees and management tend to get lazy and unprofessional but this manager politely declined and kept it curt. Food:Had the fried meatballs which come with optional hot peppers and onions. They are a mix of 3 meats that tasted extremely good. The sauce was not too much nor too little. (5/5). I have had here the fel"
395,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Extremely rude on the phone when I tried to order delivery!! The girl who was taking my order made a sarcastic comment about my name. I'll stick to Patsy's in Harlem. Customer service is everything and they failed. Thumbs down!
396,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Best pizza in the Bronx. Better than the Patsy's in East Harlem. Please never change or go away :) Margarita and Napolitana were delicious.
397,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Just found this Bronx location of Patsy's in the Morris Park section of da Bronx. Ordered a pie ""to-go"" and it was ready in no time at all. I had time to look over their menu and see that this Patsy's is affilitaed with the East Harlem location, which is one of my favorite pizza places to have a slice and the ONLY place I would go to if I'm above 30th Street in Manhattan.OK, review time. Ordered the Margarita Pie with fresh mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil. Very good, ultra thin pie, crispy crust with nice overall flavor. Would definitely return for pizza here and would try other toppings. The pie wasn't completely covered with cheese, meaning too many large, blank portions of pizza without cheese (see my pic.) Also, the basil was just small bits of basil. Could have used more and bigger pieces of basil for a Margarita Pie. Didn't have exactly the same flavor or consistancy as the East Halem location. The dough seems off a bit and I'm guessing the oven must make a difference also. The East Harlem's Patsy's usually is more burned from the oven but has a nice taste. In E. Harlem, you have to specify not to cook the pie too much if you don't want it burned. No specifying if you're getting a slice, or two, or four! No SLICES (only pies) at this Bronx location. This sucks! Pizza by the slice is a NYC institution. But they're going for the italian-style, sit down pizzeria-restaurant, except the pies are the smaller 16 inch pies, which you'll still need help devouring. The resataurant is very nice also. Cozy place, clean with friendly service and decent prices from what I could see."
398,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,We've ordered from them b4 always a pizza to take home.  Tonight was decided to go in and sit.  Everything we ordered was so delicious.  Can't wait to come back and time something different.   Staff was attentive and extremely friendly.
399,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Mmmmmmm DelishService was great & the Margarita Pizza.... was Devine I loved it. Great for kids and groups
400,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Really REALLY disappointed! I've been waiting MONTHS for this place to open and now that it finally has, Ill never go back. It isnt like the 1ST AVE one AT ALL! Small portions and WAY over priced. The first pizza on the menu is $15. It's regular pizza, like the kind I find across the street at Luciano's but 10 times the price. 1st ave charges $12 for reg coal oven pizza and 18 for margarita and they are both MUCH bigger. The margarita pie here is $20 for a shrunken 16 inch. Are they friggin kidding! It was nothing special. No oregano on the table either. Got the ceaser salad. It was 10 bucks and very small, the one in Harlem is 7.95 and huge!Also the hostess wasnt all that nice either. She rolled her eyes at me when I wanted to sit in the back where it was nice in cool and empty, instead of RIGHT IN FRONT OF THE STOVE. Please! And I wasnt the only one who asked to move.Sorry but I will stick with the neighborhood's heavyweight Patricia's when I'm home and I want thin crust pizza...much better food, service, atmosphere, staff, prices and portions! YOU HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT PATRICIA'S!"
401,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Nice location but food is not all that. Pizza is not what I expected. I love real deal Italian food and this is not the real deal. Who ever is making the pizza there must be a beginner. With a famous name like Patsy's you expect the best, was disappointed. The main coarse was delivered before the appatizers. Smh. I give it two  starts because the place is clean and colorful. But other than that the food is not all that. Im surprised they can still exist with Patricias of Moris Park and Emilios near by, Places where they know what real italian food is supposed to be like."

403,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Original pizza pie was delicious as well as the shrimp scampi risotto excellent. Service very good and attentive. Bomba for dessert also great. Definitely will return.
404,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"HORRIBLE.  DO NOT GET DELIVERY. Waited 90 minutes, pizza showed up cold.  My mistake for not ordering Emilio's.  Emilio's makes me wait but at least the pizza shows up hot.  $20 cold pizza.  Woman who answered the phone offered to send another one, but why? So I can have 2 cold pizzas? I didn't realize the ""brick"" meant cold.  Hope you go out of business soon like most places in this godforsaken neighborhood."
405,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Being a big fan of East Harlem's Patsys I was excited to learn The Bronx had one coming its way as wishing the food would be as good. The service itself was great, very attentative waiter, it was the food that I wasnt to happy with. Alot if my favorites arent on this locations menu which wasnt a deal breaker new spot new choices. The pizza is different may be due to the oven not being as seasoned as East Harlem's.  Had a seafood dish that was ok, but I was expecting first bite to have me stop and say ""Man that's good"". Ravioli's were ok again no pow factor as well as the sauce didnt taste the love. The place is busy, im sure Morris Park locals want it to be great but if your used to the East Harlem Patsys like I am, this one will let you down."
406,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I took my family at Patsy's for pizza and it was fantastic.  The waitress was great and I went a second time withe my family for pizza was great and the waiter was great.  I went with my daughter and her future husband and had then very tall waitress was horrible.  I will never have her serve me again.
407,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"My girlfriend and I were pleased to be part of the very first hour of service at this New York pizzeria chain's first location in the Bronx borough (they've been open in Queens for quite some time and plan to open a new eatery in Brooklyn, as well; these, of course, in addition to the several Manhattan locations, starting with Harlem, where it all began in 1933). Try their ""Red & White Pie"" - we did, and we love it!"
408,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Meh! Much better options in the Bronx for italian pizzaOur pizza was soggy... the service wasn't that great... we had fried ravioli and pasta... which was okay.But I feel like we could've just made it at home...The place is more for families pros: brick oven pizza, more choices than your average neighborhood pizza shopcons: quality is not as good here. You might as well just eat in Harlem or Manhattan."
409,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,The food was very good. Server was very friendly and attentive but not intrusive. We will definitely be going back. Parking is a bit of a pain.
410,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,No on the clams in butter&wine sauce! Way too salty! Not using beef steak tomatoes  in salads either.  Packaged sliced bread not from local baker . Seems like this is the place for pizza for sure!
411,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"2 stars barely. Got take-out tonight consisting of Chicken Rolletini & a sausage and broccoli rabe' pizza. The chicken dish was one medium sized piece of chicken with a small potato croquette & green beans (which were supposed to be sautéed in garlic & oil but was cold and flavorless) The pizza was very small & for 20.00 wasn't near worth it. IMO, you'd be better off going to either Patricia's, Captains or Emilio's before spending your hard-earned money here. To sum it up: Below average food with above average prices."
412,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Ordered the chicken and Broccoli Rabe hero and half the hero literally had no chicken on it.  Very inconsistent.  Only plus was fast delivery.
413,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Pizza is excellent.  Service is rushed at dinner time and not very personable.  However, it is a nice family-style restaurant.  I have never eaten anything else off the menu, but the pizza is enough to make me stop by when I'm in the area with the kids."
414,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"We recently stopped in for lunch during the week. I ordered a chicken Caesar wrap while my wife ordered spinach chicken wrap. Both were fresh and tasty. The waiter took our order and our food was served relatively quickly. No one stopped by while we were eating to see if we were pleased. It all seemed very matter of fact. Unfortunately there are very few patrons. They need to get a buzz going. No one wants to walk into an empty restaurant. I would urge that they get tables out onto the sidewalk. The scene of people eating alfresco attracts other diners. Otherwise, I fear they may be closing this newly renovated eatery."
415,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Excellent! Came here by myself as the wife and kids were out. Usually take out from here and it's always been very good. Ate a whole pie by myself!!
416,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"We have eaten here a couple of times since my first review. It would appear this place is suffering due to the high prices and really, the quality isnt any different than the local competition. The pizza at Patsys in NYC tastes better."
417,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Staff was attentive, courteous and especially accommodating. My wife and I went for lunch. The ambiance was nice, perfect for a pizza joint. We shared a margarita pizza and I had a meatball parm hero.  The dough of the pizza was tasty and as thin as it gets with a delicious sauce and fresh mozzarella. My wife raved about it while it was a little too thin for me...surely enough slices would rectify that silly comment though. The meatball parm was very good although it could have used an extra meatball. The waiter asked for our critique and was receptive to our comments. Everyone was friendly and the noise level with the party going on was nicely mitigated by the pocket wall. This place shows promise as a regular spot for my wife and I."
418,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,Ok pizza. Very thin. Went there a week after opening with my wife and we were seated and then ignored. Took a while to get the food. Drinks were never refreshed. I went back today and the service was much better. It's overpriced for what it is. I honestly wish it was better.
419,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I'm basing my review on two delivery orders.  Their Harlem location serves great food and this location is just as good.  I was impressed at how our drink orders came with complimentary cups of ice and straws in plastic bags.  I found this thoughtful and convenient.  I will definitely be ordering from here again...and again!
420,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"If you like the Harlem spot then you will love this place, pie is just like the original Patsy's and its much closer then going back to east Harlem"
421,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Awesome! Great first experience here. My server was friendly, the pizza was delicious and the service was speedy. I was surprised at how quick our bar drinks and pizza pies came out. Highly recommended and will definitely come back again. Had the Margherita pie which was delicious btw."
422,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Need to ask customer their preference as to what order the food will be served. Our salad came out after 10 minutes, then the soup came out with the main dish. Food quality overall was great. Dessert was fresh and cappuccino was spectacular."
423,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"I used love patsy's - unfortunately the one in the bronx is AWFUL!!! they get orders wrong, their pizza arrives cold, they say delivery orders come in 30 minutes and it takes 1.5 hours, and they refuse to come inside apartment buildings. Literally the worst service in the Bronx. Very disappointing since the spots in Manhattan are so much better. What a pity for the bronx...."
424,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"Was excited to try this place, had heard from my parents way back in the day that their other location had the best pizza and Italian entrees. The restaurant is nicely spaced where you don't feel cramped. The service is a hit or miss. I have been here twice. The first time was a takeout order and the young girl behind the counter looked lost. I asked to add grill chicken to my salad and pasta dish she said she would need to ask if they can do this? She asked an older gentleman who said ""of course"" we can. I asked for a diet soda and again she said she was not sure if they had diet soda????  She asked another women working and she said yes we carry diet soda!!!!! I thought since it was newly opened that I would ignore this incident and give it another try. I went recently for dine in and had a salad and specialty pizza. It was good but nothing that sets itself apart from the NUMEROUS other pizza/Italian places in the area. I also felt that the pizza was salty. I do think with some tweaking it has the potential to be much better. On a positive note, the server was attentive. But for now, given the choices in the Morris Park area I will not be returning any time soon."
425,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,This place is way over priced. It sucks. Terrible food. I will never go there again. I hope the owner sees this. Not like the 1st Avenue one at all.
426,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I went to Patsy this evening with my family. I'm from East Harlem and grew up on the Patsy's on 1st. Ave. I really hope these are not the same owners because the food was very different from 1st. Ave. My son and I first noticed the menu is very different. Some of the things they have in Harlem the don't sell in the Bronx. Second the price is more for the Bronx pies.  They don't even sell slices. Also it doesn't seem like they are using the best ingredients on the things they served. If this is your first time ever going to have patsy's I would not suggest you trying this location. East Harlem puts this bronx location to shame. The reason for them getting a three is because one they take credit cards unlike east Harlem and the waiter. The waiter was very nice. He spoke to us came back to see if we needed anything. He was a five star waiter. We thought on a Saturday night out it was going to be packed but no one was in there. We made reservations and all. Honestly with Patricia's near by I don't think they will last in the Bronx.
427,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,I love it here !!! The service is great the place is clean which is important to me ... They have a great chef Anthony who is great his dishes impress me. Pizza is great thin slice I don't feel bloated when I leave good to have a place like this in the neighborhood
428,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"What a let down! We have been waiting for Patsy's to open for a while now.  My dad, daughter & I picked this Friday (10/10/14) to go for a bite to eat. Dad and I split a large pie which we had heard so much 'hoopla' about. Well...it was like eating cardboard!!!  I do not mean dry but more like flavor-less! We are Italian and consider ourselves pizza-snobs. We agreed this could not rate higher than a 4 on a scale of 1-10. Yes, add garlic powder and salt and you get a garlic-y flavored thin crust pizza with a bit of flavor. Without the condiments, you are left, after the first few bites, with a taste-less pie! The tomato sauce on my daughters ziti was good. I did not try the meatballs but she said they were very good. Bread on the table was not great quality. Butter hard as a rock. The atmosphere in the middle dining room was not great. A bit too close to other tables, dim colors and the place is narrow.  So, if you are in the mood for good pizza and atmosphere, pass on this place. Feeling like a pasta meal? Get it to go!"
429,RlFG4WZhJV5V3Xu3ywWXVw,"ridiculously amazing italian food!!! a must for everyone in the bronx and westchester area, highly recommend the clams oreganata, rice balls, prosciutto pizza, regular pizza, chicken ala patsy pizza, risotto, linguini with white or red sauce and so much more! check out the daily specials for lunch as well as dinner, also a fun place to grab a glass of wine, the best of the best"
430,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Yo.Simply put, Just go. The vibe is right, the food is amazing ( had the skirt stake, it was fire), The staff is beautiful, and the area by the water is good for a date night. Fellas, Take your girl here and You'll get brownie points. Also, make sure you ask about the Happy hour specials. Mondays drinks are half off.  Peace."
431,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"My daughters pick for a double celebration venue. I have higher expectations to the place  basing on the reviews I have read  prior dining. Seeing  few guests wearing sneakers and jeans was a turned off when we checked in. I know it's not in the control of the management if guests are more comfortable wearing those style but to diners... have consideration as the owners are trying to level up their place. The wait staff service was excellent... it covered my dissatisfaction in the beginning. Additionally, the food was delicious  ( I had paella, my family seemed happy with what  they've ordered) and honestly their sangrias were the best. Although the Manhattan  skyline was partially covered now by the ferry station, dining with the best skyline in the world view still one of the restaurants best perks.  Did I mentioned that it was pleasantly surprising to know that they allowed us in bringing our own birthday cake and oh well served to us with no trouble asking for it? Parking spot is difficult to find so it's  valet service is a big plus. It was funny though that the attendant took time looking for our car where it was just parked on the street in front of us. There is a free photo opportunity of the skyline within walking distance. A recommended place for a celebration."
432,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I attended a Yelp Elite event at Blend on the Water many years ago, and decided to celebrate my 29th birthday here since I remember having such a good time! Be sure to make reservations, and dress to impress because the evening atmosphere will call for it. They dim the lights a bit too much, but their menus have LED backlights and the staff will provide additional candles upon request.As far as food and drink goes, everything I've tried here has been very good - but I especially recommend the seafood paella and pernil. My brother is vegan and I appreciate that they offer a meatless pollo a la plancha, as well. Valet parking can be a little slow on the way out, but it's easier than trying to find a spot in this part of LIC. Speaking of location, be sure to get a few photos with the waterfront view of the skyline right behind the restaurant afterwards - it truly encapsulates our beautiful city."
433,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"this is my second time here and I have to say I love it ! first time me and my bf went for a quick lunch during the week , I ordered a mimosa (yum) we ordered the skirt steak and shrimp mofongo , (soooo good) , small portions but definitely tasty !The second time me and my sister went on a Saturday and it was jam packed ! But we were lucky enough to sit at the bar & then get a table by the bar , we ordered some food and drinks ! So good ! I ordered a dragonberry drink that was lit on fire  that made for a good picture . Service was fast & friendly ! Love this place"
434,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This place is AMAZING. Everything about it is top notch. **Strongly suggest making a reservation**First, we arrived and were greeted by the valet gentlemen (very busy.) We had a reservation for 8pm on a Friday and were seated right away. Our waitress came over and asked our drink order. We got a frozen margarita and a margarita on the rocks.We shared with the guacamole and then Chorizo Mac & Cheese as an appetizer. Guacamole we thought was going to be table side. It wasn't that great, so we'd skip that next time. But the Chorizo Mac & Cheese was OUT OF THIS WORLD. Strongly suggest. Wasn't too spicy.Entrees; we both did the Churrasco skirt steak. I asked for my steak well done but it came out medium. Our waitress didn't check on us for a while that I ended up eating it, but I definitely would have sent it back. The view is what makes this place. The restaurant has huge glass windows that you can see out of. Very dim light, romanic set up.  We saw lots of birthdays being celebrated here too."
435,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,It is a must to make reservations! I have never stopped by once without it because of how busy it is. They do offer valet parking.The drinks were strong but worth the price.Starters came out very quickly. Entree took a bit longer. I don't think the food comes out in the correct order as people next to us who ordered after us got their food before us.Needless the say the food was worth the wait! I would definitely come back again maybe to sit outside instead. The inside is a bit dark and loud to may want to keep that in mind.
436,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Beautiful spot by the water. Perfect for date night or any event.We started off dinner with the guacamole. Fresh fried chips is the way to go, it makes all the difference. The restaurant also gave us complimentary crispy arepas. I will definitely be ordering those my next visit. Tender shredded short rib on top of a fried little arepa. For my main, I had to get the skirt steak and my wife ordered the salmon. My skirt steak was super tender perfect with the chumichurri. I do with they offered a little more rice with the meal. The tostones were a nice addition, soaking up all the meat juices and chimichurri. My wife enjoyed her salmon, she said the pineapple sauce was a nice touch.All in all, delicious food and friendly staff. We will be returning soon."
437,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Alexandra was such an amazing waitress!! She was so attentive and kind! The view from this place is the best I've seen in LIC. Happy hour is from 11 AM - 7 PM with sangrias being $7 each and shots being only $5 each! I got the chicken lomo and it was huge and delicious. The other dish we got was also so good (rancho huevores). Sangrias are free with check in! SO SWEET and yummy fresh fruit! Free dessert for birthday celebrations :) Great service, great views, great service, very reasonable pricing"
438,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Blend on the Water is the more scenic version of the original Blend. Although it's the same style of food, I prefer the original. It's tucked away, a bit more private. That's not to say the food here isn't great, because it was quite tasty, and you can't beat the backdrop of the city skyline."
439,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I had dinner here on July 4th. The interior was nice with high ceilings and large windows. There was live music but it was way too loud. I had to be yelling at my friend. I requested to sit outside but it was closed for that day. However, you were allowed to buy drinks at the bar and access the outdoor area. The hostess did her best to accomodate and seated us by the window. Huge plus!- Crispy Arepas: Pretty good. The arepas came warm, crispy and soft on inside. No complaints on the pulled short rib, avocado and cotija cheese. - Chorizo Mac n Cheese: Beware this was very SALTY. There were plenty of chorizo and bread crumbs. It was rich but a bit too liquidy for my liking. - Pernil: Delicious! But it could use a little more seasoning. The pork was super tender fall of the bone. It paired nicely with the hearty beans and rice. The portion size was great. On Thursdays they have $7 martinis all night which includes various flavors. What a steal! We also checked in for free sangria (rosé or white) but it was really bad. It tasted like sugary juice. Service was okay. Our waitress was missing the entire time. Dress code was a mix. I saw people both casual or dressy. Overall, I think it's a nice place for a special occasion and I highly recommend making reservations."
440,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"For this visit I was not as impressed with the food as I was the first time. The quality has definitely eroded from my first visit. The specifics are simple.... over cooked rice on  the arroz can Moriscos and a shameful serving on the smallest mussels I have ever had.  Honestly it was just bad, I could have had better on Roosevelt Avenue. But maybe tonight was not a good night for them as my meal came when the rest of my party was almost  finished with their dinner! They did bring out a complementary dessert platter, but sorry that does not compensate for a lousy dish!!!! The crispy chicken I am told was good, as was the Grilled salmon and the appetizers.  The service was also not as good as our previous visit."
441,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"What a great view for a restaurant. Parking is an issue so save yourself the headache and go for the 7 dollar valet parking! The interior is very appealing with a huge bar area that was fairly crowded. We were seat within minutes as we made a reservation, you should always make one because it was very busy and walk in are not really appreciated, so I have overheard. The service was very good and the menu had enough dishes on it that you would have no problem finding a meal. Meats - Seafood - and poultry. But don't forget their appetizers! Really excellent and served in an eye appealing fashion (see my pictures). The skirt steak is one of their most popular dishes and yes it does not disappoint. The seafood over yellow rice was delicious and plentiful! But for dessert --- just get the sampler platter.. it was all gone !!!! Lol"
442,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"The ambiance and location are what make this great. I'm pretty sure at night, this is the spot. However, aside from the free Sangria I received due to checking in on yelp, I'd say everything else was mediocre. I say this with all due respect, I'm sure some people may find the food here phenomenal; we however, did not. The guacamole and chips were pretty average at most, hard to really mess up. The mofongo was not traditional, or anything special. It's literally just balled up plantains with some gravy / shrimp tossed around it for presentation. The steak tacos, they weren't bad but it lacked a kick/pop you normally get when you first bite into a well made taco. Again, I'm sure the experience here would've been different had this been at night given the location is pretty good. The food however could use an upgrade. Sangria was on point though!"
443,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Lively restaurant on the water in Lincoln City, just over the Queensboro bridge from Midtown, we ordered small plates to share. We had the Lobster and crab filled Tequenos. If you e never had these before they're like Venezuelan spring rolls but the wrap is a thicker tender almost pie dough like crust.  We also ordered the short rib topped arepas which are slightly sweet and the short rib is shredded over top with tomatoes and micro greens. Yum! The arepas are crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. It also comes with a mayonnaise dip which is a little heavy for me, I would have preferred something tart and/or spicy for the dip to cut the heaviness a bit. Otherwise the filling is delish!Our main arrives but it's so dark I can't see it! We ordered the crispy chicken with fried rice and avocado salad to share and it was fantastic! The chicken breast with wing attached is lightly breaded and fried, is served with a honey mustard sauce. The fried rice was amazing! I wish I could see what was in it, but I'm pretty sure there were chicken pieces in it too!A delightful evening, it's definitely a place to celebrate a special occasion, romantic, there is also outdoor seating if you prefer a little more intimate and quiet! Wait staff is friendly and very casual"
444,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Wow! I wish I had tried this restaurant sooner. I have always seen social media posts about how awesome this place is, but never tried. Fiancé and I made reservations on the Open TableApp. We were late because we were finding parking. (Side note: parking is tough even on a Tuesday night. If you have good luck, and don't mind your bumper getting tapped - street parking is for you. If not, just throw it in a lot and save yourself the circle for parking agony) Despite being late we were able to get sat outside straight away. The restaurant has cool back lit menus which is nice for us with bad sight in the dark. Our waitress was patient, and attentive. No rush - we were able to dine in peace. They also came out with sparklers for my fiancé's birthday - he loved it. Food was seasoned very well, and drinks were great too. Definitely looking to return and enjoy the view in the park."
445,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Perfect Date Night! The food was delicious, the drinks were amazing and the fact that it's right by the water it couldn't have been more perfect! Service was fantastic and our waitress helped pick our appetizer which was the best choice and very delicious. I will definitely come here again."
446,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"So I've been here before for a birthday brunch in the past and even though it was packed  and we sat at one of the tables near the bar- I enjoyed both my drinks and my food! I had the coconut mojito , sangrita ( sangria and margarita) and then I had the mofongo con Camerones and I loved it . Friend had the churrasco and  eggs and loved it also ~~~~~~~~I recently came back on Saturday for a friend's bday. Reservations are held for 15mins . Otherwise you go on the list and that can take 90mins+ on a Saturday There is valet for $7 . Get cash Place is super crowded on Saturday... lFor starters - We had the guacamole , wild mushroom flatbread and the short rib arepas which were good . Dinner entree I had the Churrasco with chumming sauce . Eh it was ok . Friends had the salmon , arroz con mariscos and the vegan chicken and they all loved it . Place is super loud on Saturday. Hard to hear others . I like Sunday brunch better ."
447,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"50/50 review on the place. I went today for lunch after my cousin's wedding (party of 15), and the location is beautiful, by the water, the scenery was pleasant. They have valet (not sure the price), the food was okay (I've had better Latin food elsewhere). The food was typical. Some items needed more seasoning on them. I had the Mazorca for an appetizer, and the pernil for lunch. I had two strawberry daiquiris and a pina colada (the drinks were the best things I had today)."
448,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Came here for my 24th birthday brunch and was very happy. Everything from the mimosas to the food was filled with so much flavor. Our waitress was nice and attentive when asked for recommendations because it was our first time here. They even gave a complimentary desert dish wish was very nice. Would definitely recommend this place!
449,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This place is an absolute joke! We had a dinner reservation for my birthday at 7:15 PM. We arrived at 7:10 PM with the expectation that outdoor seating would be available because that's what we were told on the phone. Upon arrival the manager (tall, Hispanic male) was very unwelcoming. There was a young lady at the desk with him who asked us to wait at the bar or the waiting area until our table was ready. We waited 10 minutes and ultimately decided to go to a one of our fave restaurants in Manhattan. The seating area looked like a modern cafeteria and I just was not around for that. From sitting in the waiting area I was unimpressed with the wait staff and cleanliness of the restaurant. The photos most definitely look better online and we shall NOT return. Long story short, save your coins and go elsewhere. This place is trash and so is the staff."
450,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Great food, drinks and beautiful place. I just wish they had more on their menu or changed it up from time to time."
451,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"DOUBLE CHECK YOUR BILL!!!!!!I came to Blend for a birthday celebration last night with a party of 11. Wait time was long, even with reservation they don't seat you unless everyone from your party is here. Some people came a few minutes late and they gave our table away so we waited an additional hour +. However, my complaint is about the bill. Their policy is that they add 20% gratuity for party of 6+. Our 20% gratuity was $82.40. The total bill came out to be $530.96 with the 20% added. However, the amount I was charged on my card is $613.36. The difference between the amount on my card and the bill is exactly $82.40 so they charged my card with gratuity twice. Honestly, I thought it could be a genuine human error. I called the restaurant the day after to get it sorted out and the response on the phone was that ""the person that's in charge of dealing with this isn't here"". So I left my info awaiting a call back. However giving this a little more thought and looking at other yelp reviews, I saw this happened before, the same exact issue. From what I saw on yelp, the response the manager gave was ""this happens all the time"" , ""you must have pressed the add tip button when you signed"". No. I signed my name and did not press any buttons. It's honestly so shady and disgusting restaurants think that it's okay to fool people and to play dumb and make you the fool when caught. People come in your restaurant, drink, have a good time, have means of celebration and they think it's okay to take advantage, cause who really checks their bill the next morning or who even remembers right? Currently still trying to resolve this and get my money back."
452,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"My colleague has been telling me about this place for over a year. Now I see why she frequents this place. Customer service was A 1.  The hostess, waitress, busboy and valet were all pleasant and inviting.The view of the Ed Koch bridge along with views of the Chrysler and Empre State Building are reasons why this place has over 2500 reviews.In addition to the views and service the food is pretty good too. The salmon was good as well as the chicken skewers. My sister had the pernil and cleaned her plate. All that was left was a bone. The apple empanadas were not too sweet but a nice end to the meal.I enjoyed the salsa music and was told by other patrons that they do have live salsa bands. Totally enjoyed my time here. They also have a NYC ferry stop on the water side of the restaurant."
453,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"LOVED Blend on the Water! My boyfriend took me here recently for my birthday. Everything was perfect. We were a bit late for our reservation so it took us a little while to get a table but what can you expect from a very popular restaurant on a Friday night. The atmosphere was great. The music was very authentic to the culture and the lighting was just right for a romantic candle lit dinner. Not to mention there were glass windows from ceiling to floor almost all around the restaurant showing a beautiful ocean view.There were people dressed up for bigger occasions and other dressed casually for just a nice dinner out with their loved ones. The staff was super nice and friendly. They were very attentive and genuinely cared about the kind of the experience you had. The food was super good. I had the churrasco with rice, beans and tostones and my boyfriend had the chicken with Hispanic fried rice and fries. Both dishes had a great amount of flavor. To drink my boyfriend and I shared one of their fish bowl drinks. I do not remember the name but it smoked just the way the drinks at the sugar factory do. It had the perfect amount of alcohol for the both of us to share and not need a second. Overall , I'm very satisfied with my experience. I can't wait to visit again."
454,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came here to celebrate my friends birthday. The place looks elegant with their lights and decorations. It has really nice view of the east River and Manhattan skyline. Noise level was a little loud but was still able to make conversations with my friends. The bathroom felt a little awkward with the girl opening the sink and handing the towel. I felt obligated to tip but since I didn't carry my bag with me, I didn't have cash. I just thanked her awkwardly and I return back to my seat. For food, they have few vegan option. So I got the Vegan Pollo A La Plancha. It came with vegan chicken with almond milk sauce, rice, beans, and maduro (plantains). Their take on this classic dish was great. Definitely enjoyed my meal. The serving seems small because of their big plate but it was definitely filling. My non vegan friends definitely enjoyed their meals also. The staff were very attentive and helpful. We also ordered drinks that were pretty good. Would definitely get their pineapple mojito again."
455,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came to this place on a Wednesday night after hearing great reviews of this place but I felt rather disappointed with the food and service. The surrounding area and the ambiance of the restaurant is nice (but super dark). We ordered 3 appetizers to share, the crispy arepas, lobster and crab tequenos, and mussels. I thought they were just okay- the braised short rib on the arepas was super dry. For my entree, I got the filet mignon (it was under seasoned and bland) and subbed out the arugula for the cilantro mashed potatoes. Overall, was disappointed with the food since I heard such great reviews about this place and while the servers were nice, the service was just super slow."
456,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"My daughter and her new husband picked Blend for after their wedding, and everything was top notch. I love the openness of the window views. They even had a nice note for the newlyweds and a surprise sparkler presented to them in a lava cake."
457,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Starting super corny intro in 3 2 1...BLEND = Best Latin Entrees No Doubt!! Came here for a graduation dinner and I couldn't be happier. The food and drinks were amazing and the atmosphere was equally as nice. Pros                                        Affordable drinksWide variety of entreesGreat view Polite staff Cheap valetConsLong wait time even with reservations(expected when the food is this good)PS:Blend if you want to use my acronym for promo slide me my coin :) Lol jk but really tho
458,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The food was extremely delicious esp the pernil and the churassco dishes. The drinks were full of sugar esp the frozen margaritas. The service was a bit slow at the beginning and then they were rushing you out the minute you put your fork down. But overall great atmosphere and food.
459,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Me an my husband went here first time for our anniversary, we had a great time the food  was amazing an not to mention the awesome view an great staff, we are looking forward to dine again"
460,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Alright so this is one fancy, classy restaurant and yes it is on the pricey side. Its great for groups, couples date, anniversary  or just a date. You have to make reservations in advance. The skyline view is beautiful especially at night. Resturant is clean, trendy, elegant  and for all age groups. Delicious Latin food, decorative and worth it all. Vibe is upbeat and there is music. Bathrooms are clean which says a lot about a restaurant. The white sangeria hit the spot."
461,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,This place is immaculate classy well set up. As soon you get to the front they offer valet parking. Outstanding I love when o done have to park far. Even better when someone roles your vehicle to you. Make me feel like I'm vip status lolThe food is awesome. It's a Latin restaurant. So I had chicken rice and beans. Prices are decent for the environment. They have a water front view so you can see the water while you eat. It's a great scenery. The place is huge. It was my first time a friend recommended me there. The customer service was very professional and upscale. They did a great job. I had my food out very quickly and they checked on me quite often. The place is 15 minutes from the city so If you on a date night you can drive right across the bridge in be in the city in minutes. It's also 15? Minutes from Brooklyn. It's right in the middle of everything. Huge plus for me!!!!
462,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I live right next to this restaurant and I finally eat here a few nights ago with a group of friends. It was a Tuesday night and the place was fairly busy. I know well Blend on Vernon Blvd, and I always thought that one was better, and I have say my dining experience was great! I particularly love the sangria, which was made with rose wine: really tasteful. The group shared guacamole, and various appetizers, including salmon cakes, piononos, and crispy arepas. We were delighted and made a few order of all. Everything was delicious. This restaurant is perfect for a party or group of friends night."
463,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"We came here to celebrate Fathers Day with my in laws. Although the place was pretty full we were seated with 5 minutes of our arrival. The restaurant was large with with cool decor and big windows which allowed for natural light. I ordered the passion fruit Mojito and it was tasty. We ordered guacamole, salmon cakes, chicken skewers, lobster and crab tequenos as appetizers. For my main dish i ordered the  arroz con mariscos (pictured) with a side of Maduros. My meal was delicious! It was seasons really well and the portion was just right. Everyone enjoyed their food and we plan to come back soon!"
464,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Went here for my birthday and it was wonderful! The coconut mojito was bomb and the food was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to others.
465,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Of all the Blends we've been to, this is our second favorite (Vernon is #1). We came here a couple times after they first opened, however the most memorable experience was the day after Christmas! Absolutely noooo restaurants were open and we were starving to eat. Blend saved the day... they were open and it actually wasn't that busy go figure.. Food is always on point service is pretty good, but mostly you come for the ambiance and this is their strength."
466,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Best restaurant / bar for a big celebration with friends!I always see people with huge birthday balloons here. Atmosphere is always so great! Love the view!
467,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This restaurant is beautiful. Big glass windows and a nice, big patio to sit outside. I was worried about getting in at first because the website says there is a strict dress-code, however I was able to get in with a tshirt, flannel and flip flops, my friend was able to get in with a tshirt and shorts. No hats or athletic gear is allowed. I'm glad we were able go to in because the food was great. The buttered chicken we got as an appetizer was okay but I hate that it is offered as 3 skewers when there are two people. I ordered the lime salmon and it was incredible and I could eat that meal every day. The service was great until it got to the point where we asked for our check - which took FOREVER. I must say, I am a sucker for nice water glasses and I loved theirs and they kept it full! If I'm in the area again, I would love to eat here again."
468,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Celebrated my anniversary at this restaurant. We visited this location during brunch. They serve Latin dishes and some American. I had the seafood paella which I would rate a 8/10 as the rice was a little mushy and could had a bit more flavor.My boyfriend had the chimichurri steak which he loved!We also had chips and guacamole as an appetizer which was good.We ordered the pitcher of sangria not realizing how large it would be. It would have been nice for our waitress to give us a heads up on the size of it as we struggled to finish the whole thing which was definitely for a 4-6 person party. She also could have been more friendly.The restaurant itself has great set up and ambiance with a beautiful view.Whether you want a nice view or want to watch the game at the bar, Blend is a great option.I would visit again!"
469,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,This was one of my favorite parts of my trip. I'm originally from Miami and I visited NY during the holidays with some family. Being away from home and what I'm used to was weird but Blend on the Water really gave me that Hispanic feel I'm so used to back home. It's a beautiful place and you have a view of the city from the inside. They play all types of salsa music - my favorite! The food was delicious. I ordered the churrasco and the meat was cooked to perfection. The beans were great and the tostones weren't overly fried - nice and crisp just how I like it. For dessert I ordered the coconut tres leche. It was good but I didn't really get the gist of the tres leche. It was too coconut based. Just tasted like a coconut pastry of some sort. I highly recommend Blend on the Water for any sort of dinner whether it's a date or a get together with family and/or friends. I would love to visit again.
470,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Yes. Yes. YESSS. Once upon a summer day I came here for margaritas and they were so delicious that I decided to have my birthday dinner here as well recently. Upon walking in, you have the most beautiful view of the city and the inside is decorated with such lovely chandeliers! It's all quite pretty and the space is large enough for corporate events. It's a fancy place come dinner time, but much more casual during happy hour. As for the menu, they've got a wide range of chicken, beef, dish, and pork. My faves are the lomo saltado and coconut tilapia. A dinner for 2 will range $85 for app, entree, drink per person. Now, be warned that they have a 15 min policy. My friend came for her bday and they turned her away at the 20 min mark. Also, must make reservations and request a seat by the window! (:"
471,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I came here on a Thursday with my parents for my mother birthday brunch celebration. When we came in, the hostesses was great and seated us to our table. Once we were seated our server Angelica came and introduced herself and began taking our order. We ordered a bottle of wine and informed her that we would like 3 glasses since there were 3 of us. When she returned with our wine, we had only received 2 glasses. Informed her that we just need one more glass of wine and with an unpleasant gesture she stated that she will bring the other glass once my dad came in from parking. Our entrees were served, my parents and I were having a great time UNTIL she took away our plates once we were finished. While she took away our plates SHE DROPPED FOOD onto my mother's white shirt. She then had the look of surprised due to this event. SHE DID NOT APOLOGIZE after this event and left once my dad PICKED up the food that SHE HAD DROPPED onto my mother's shirt. After few minutes when we asked for the check i informed her that she had dropped food onto my mother's shirt and that she didn't even apologize for the action. She stated that she did, she THEN TRIED TO BLAME IT on my father stating that it was him who picked up the food and that's why it had stained. I had to remind her that regardless who picked up the food the shirt would've still be stained because the food directly dropped on my mother's shirt. She apologized and left the table. While i was waiting for my check i saw that her and the bartender were having a discussion and i was SURE that it was regarding the conversation i just had with angelica b.c the bartender kept giving unpleasant stares directly towards our table. After the incident she bring over a dessert informing us that the dessert was on the house for her mistake. Although she gave us a ""dessert on the house"" I am leaving a 1 star review because during my time there I felt very uncomfortable during my interactions with the server. She was not friendly and tired to blame her mistake on someone else. I would not have felt sour or upset with this experience if she just owned up to her mistake and apologized from the start."
472,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The food was amazing however we were charged for things we did not order. Our table ordered 2 bowls of guacamole and we were charged for four. Each guacamole was $12 dollars. We should have been charged only $24 but we were charged $48. I would just be careful checking your receipt before leaving.
473,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,This restaurant was incredible. My boyfriend made reservations for date night at the other location because he didn't realize there were two different restaurants in LIC. But the people in the front were soooo nice and understanding about it and they still seated us. Our waitress Genesis was so sweet and even surprised me with a sparkler and dessert. The food is amazing and the location is so perfect. We can't wait to come back. Thank you for such amazing customer service and food!!!!!!
474,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Blend is one of my favorite restaurants in Queens. The location and atmosphere are amazing! The best time to go is right at sunset! My boyfriend and I ate outside and I think we should have chosen inside instead. It was just really buggy but that was our own fault for choosing outside. For an appetizer, we just got the guacamole and chips which was great! We also both got Rose Sangria and it was free for checking in on Yelp! For dinner, I had the fettuccine with shrimp and tomatoes and it is always so good! It comes in a garlic/butter/white wine sauce that is amazing. any boyfriend got the yellow rice with the seafood and he loved it.  We were too stuffed to even look at the dessert menu. Our waitress Alexandra was great and very nice! Our food also came out really fast- probably because it was a Wednesday night."
475,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"One of the best meals I've had in a while! My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were not one bit disappointed with the service, atmosphere, or food. We arrived about 20 minutes early but the host was able to seat us right away in their beautiful outdoor area. The corn appetizer was delicious and had just the right amount of spice to it. We both got steaks as our main course and an extra side of mashed potatoes. My skirt steak was cooked to perfection and came with a small side of rice and beans and fried plantains. I knew that the food was amazing when I didn't even need to ask for salt or pepper. For dessert we split the warm chocolate cake that melted in our mouths. We devoured it in about 2 minutes. The rose sangria was also very good- not overly sweet but definitely packed a punch! We will absolutely be back to try more items on their menu."
476,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Great location with a beautiful view of Manhattan. Decor on the inside is pleasant with a smooth dim-lighted ambiance. Food selections are cleaver and interesting. Everything was very tasty. Unfortunately, Blend On The Water, although very pretty with tasty food, has fallen into the category of a Once-A-Year type of place due to their high prices. The type of place you go on someone's birthday. Parking is little shotty, but worth it if you've never been here before. The staff seems nice but sometimes too overwhelmed when it's busy. Great neighborhood to be in as a nice stroll before or after dinner on the boardwalk is a really nice touch."
477,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Went to celebrate a friends birthday.  Ambiance is always great (as always)  Sangria and seafood ""paella"" was good.  The place was busy for a tuesday night."
478,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"We were very disappointed with this restaurant, especially after all the great reviews. We went for Dinner on a Thursday night round 5:30. When we got there, there was only one other table. Water came after about 10 minutes, and a waitress came after over 20 minutes. The waitress that came said, I'm not your waitress, but I'll take your order because I see you've been waiting a long time. The waitress for our table passed us many times and ignored us trying to call her. The apps came out, we ate, they were taken away. We had the lobster and crab tequenos, which were ok, nothing special about them at all. We could barely taste the ingredients, it was all mush.  Dinner came, we split the eggplant rellena, which was decent, again nothing to brag about. Our ""waitress"" or anyone never stopped to ask how anything is. There were 2 other tables when we finished eating.  The manager that leaned on the bar the entire time we were there, came over after my wife was trying to flag down a waitress. He asked how he could help, and he sent our waitress over who then dropped off the check. I've Never experienced a service this bad in my many years of dining as an adult. My wife and I have been together for over 14 years and we always enjoyed going out to eat.  I would never come here again, and never ever recommend this place to anyone."
479,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I was a little iffy about coming here because 1. It's all the way in LIC and 2. Latin food is not my fave. But I'm so glad I did. I came on a rainy night so I missed out on whatever view this place offers. Blend on the Water was ""yuugee,"" there was a bar area, tables in the main dining area, and some more seats in the back in a more quiet section. My party of six was brought to the quiet section which was good because we were able to hear ourselves talk (until a loud drunk party was also brought to the back). Our waitress, Sayuri, was very sweet and knowledgeable about the menu items. We kept asking her about the portion sizes. She told us the fish bowl (midsummer night's dream) would be good for two people, so we also got a pitcher of rose sangria (good for four people). We still shared the fish bowl among us six people (she gave us six straws). We all thought the fish bowl was a lot better than the rose sangria. 10/10 would get again. For the table, we got the chicharron de pollo skewers (lightly battered chicken breast, mango beurre blanc) which only comes with three skewers but we just split it because we still wanted to save room for our entrees. You must must get this! It was soo delicious, mainly because of the mango beurre blanc. We also got the chorizo mac and cheese for the table, some people loved it and some people didn't care too much about it. I also got the chorizo mac and cheese as my entree cause I'm a mac and cheese fiend. It was a bit too liquid-y for my taste and the chorizo was good at first but became too much after awhile. Two people got the pernil (pork shank) which was pretty good; the pork fell right off. Two people got the arroz con mariscos and both only managed to eat half.We told the staff that it was our friend's birthday celebration, and they gave us the complimentary birthday platter with a sparkler/candle. The platter consisted of four different desserts including chocolate lava cake with ice cream, coconut flan, and pina colada tres leches cake. Anyway we had a lovely time here thanks to Sayuri. I would definitely come back again (albeit far) to try the other dishes! Oh, and the menu freaking lights up when you open it. How cool is that?!"
480,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"So my first time at blend on the water.Honest opinion- I made reservations and when we gotThere we still had to wait for a table about 30 minutes. Which is fine. The hostess/Manager was very nice and pleasant.Felt welcomed. At first glancethe atmosphere at night is very intimate. Very romantic.  Got a passion fruit margarita and it was wonderful. Got a classic and it was evenStronger. The appetizers wereWonderful. Guacamole and chips, crispy arepas and the pionono. The piononos weren't your classic piononos, so don't expect sweet plantains on it. I ordered churrasco/ skirt steak medium well. I wish it was a little more cooked? And the steak had almost no flavor. But the rice and beans were good. And the mofongitos it bring. My husband had a the seafood plate and it was really small for him. He wasn't satisfied. My friend ordered chicken in lemon garlic and is good. Her husband orders fettuccini with shrimp in garlic sauce, and literally was just bland and a bunch of olive oil with basil. Bland bland bland. Our waitress was wonderful. The food took forever to come out. About 30 minutes for appetizers and 45 minutes for our food. After the appetizers. The manager came and said dessert was on them just for the long wait. Which was nice. Overall will I come here again? Yes. Definitely. The drinks are awesome and the appetizers were delish. The entres? Not my taste. Little bland. The place was beautiful and the people are great. The vibe is wonderful and the view is lovely. definitely will return."
481,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The service was horrible. It wasn't that busy and took awhile for the waitress to come over so we immediately ordered food and drinks. I ordered a Bellini and my friend ordered Prosecco and for food I did Huevos Rancheros and she did Churrasco and Eggs. Somehow we ended up getting our food before our drinks so we asked the server. Either she never put the order in or the bar forgot because it took a few more minutes for our drinks to come. On the plus side the food was good but they had to much oil with the steak.
482,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I came here to celebrate my bf's boyfriend. I was disappointed with the lack of professionalism with the valet service. Other than that, my visit here was great. The food and the ambiance was awesome."

The food was very good albeit the service was a little slow. Random discrepancies though because some of us asked for iced coffee while we were waiting for our tables but the bartender said that wasn't offered. When we sat down at our table, the waitress offered it to us, so we were quite confused. Other than that, we had a good time."
484,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Blend on the water was a last minute decision as I was heading into the city. I called prior to coming in and asked for a reservation, which I dont even know why one is needed seeing as I made one via google and I still had to wait 30 mins. After finally going up to the hostess stand twice we followed a hostess to what I thought my table was going to be and than she told us to wait in the corner because the table wasn't cleaned. We were seated and menus were given to us and it was after 11:30 at this point so I was looking around for our waitress because there wasnt one to be found. After waiting a while a girl pops up and stared that she was going to be our waitress tonight but if we could wait again and she would be right with us. Finally she made it back to our table, orders were taken and than we finally got water on the table.... Our food came to the table and it was 12am I wanted to get dessert elsewhere so I told the person that I was with to hurry so we can make it to this dessert spot that I was looking forward to. I ordered the salmon with cilantro mashed potatoes, which was great but the mashed potatoes could have been eased up with the cilantro. After another 15 mins of looking and getting up from my seat to find the waitress I stopped her in her tracks and asked for the check. I quickly handed her my card and signed. I didnt think that it would take so long just for dinner but I guess it is what it is... There were so many birthdays being celebrated that night it was literally almost every table... too over rated"

488,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,A group of 8 of us had brunch reservations on a Sunday at 12pm; upon arrival we were immediately seated. Our waitress was really nice ( I cannot remember her name she has beautiful light eyes); she even treated us to shots. We ordered a few appetizers which were good ( one of the appetizers arrived with a hair & the waitress immediately brought us out a fresh order). My friend & I ordered the shrimp mofongo which was OK both meals were cold our waitress instead we order something else which I didn't :/  everyone else enjoyed their meals. Their frozen Sangria were really good!! Towards the end of brunch they were playing music.
489,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Stopped by with my team members after a meeting to have lunch. The restaurant was clean, spacious and had a great view of Manhattan. Our meals were very well prepared and presented beautifully. Restaurant staff were very nice and pleasant and all looked professionally dressed. The music wasn't too loud and the drinks were mixed exceptionally. The price was not too high. It was an enjoyable experience and we will definitely be back."
490,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"As much as the reviews portrays this place as a ""4 star"" restaurant, that review is mostly based for parties less than 5. My family and I came in for dinner with a party of 10, and the service was HORRIBLE. The waiter (Stephanie G), did not care what we wanted and in most cases did not even remember our orders. My sister ordered a drink and it never came, so she eventually had to cancel it. I get it, after 7 people, the gratuity is automatically included, but that does not mean the service has to be horrendous. I would not recommend this place for dinner. The one star is only for the food and the support staff."
491,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Love, Love, Love this place.  I visited Blend with a co-worker after work for her Birthday on a Tuesday evening. The place was packed. We had a little wait but it was worth it. When I checked in I received a free white Sangria which was made just right. *Five stars for the drink alone!*  Our waitress was fabulous - No complaints. The ambience was Beautiful-Definately No complaints.  Music on point. Food presentation was Beautiful and delectable. My Favorite evening spot. Valet parking available...street parking is also available after you ride around for a while. Subway station is a little ways away. Everything is fairly priced"

493,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This is my second time here, the first was better. The appetizers were excellent and the food was okay. The server was not attentive and was gone for long periods of time. It was really dead in the restaurant which made it odd but nevertheless, food was good and my family enjoyed it."
494,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"1 free sangria with a yelp check-in; spotty service in this area so make sure you have the offer pulled up before you sit downThey have WiFi, but that is also very spotty.The restaurant itself is very big and spacious with high ceilings. For a party of 8, we came on a Thursday at around lunch time and was seated immediately. Our waitress was very friendly and took our orders right away; I ordered the Taquitos de Carne. The drinks came out approx. 5 minutes after ordering, and all the food came out pretty quickly, approx. 15 minutes after ordering, except for mine, even though we all ordered at the same time. I can only guess that the waitress forgot to put in my order. Because my order didn't come, every one at the table had to wait another 10 minutes or so for my food to come out before they ate.The Taquitos de Carne was a 3 pieces of soft shell steak taco - taquitos may confuse some into thinking it's the deep fried egg roll. The steak tacos were good; I just wished it came out when everyone else's food came out because by then all their food went cold. Whilst drinking my sangria, I noticed an odd blue object floating around in the drink. I dug it up and found a part of a scrubber in there. This grossed me out, but it was too late to say anything about it as we have already paid and was about to leave. It was just a bit disappointing to end my meal that way since I had a decent time here aside from my order never being entered, and the blue dish scrubber floating in my sangria. Perhaps some quality control and revision is needed here."
495,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came in here due to the great reviews & tasty pictures posted... unfortunately it looks better than what it is... I'm not saying it wasn't good, it was just ok...Service, they weren't excellent but they were good enough... let's start at the beginning So they have Valet parking but you have to pay for it ($7 not a lot for city location) but really ?! You're getting my money in the restaurant & out of it too ?! (Mind you they park it in the street, i didn't see a lot!) There is a door man, which was very nice & friendlyWhen you walk in about 6 hostess hanging out in the front & although they weren't rude they weren't friendly.. they did sit us down almost right away (for a party of 12!) that was really nice Waitress came, took our orders but didn't ask us what we wanted to drink, nor gave us a drink menu.. since they serve water I guess we didn't notice to half way through which is when everyone called/ ask waitress for them Food came out in a nice timely matter I had the arepas appetizers, they were goodAlso ate the churrasco & it was a bit mediocre... steak was a bit tough, not juicy, edible... but I had better meat, at tons of other places for a lot less My husband had the seafood rice which had tons of seafood taste, in every bite but too many vegetables over powering the dish My son had the sausage Mac/ cheese & he loved it, super cheesy Last but not least, I checked in on Yelp & received a free sangria offer & they wouldn't acknowledge it .. she said it had to be redeemed during certain days/ hours ..which I thought was so horrible...& no I wouldn't go back so there goes that !!!"
496,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I came here for brunch two weekends ago to catch up with old friends. Our waitress was Sayuri and she was an absolute sweetheart! Not only did we all love our food and drinks, but she made our experience even better. The restaurant does offer valet parking for $7, which we opted for after making one circle around the block (parking is difficult in this area, don't bother). If you check in on Yelp you get a free sangria (per person/per check-in). Do so before entering the restaurant because even when connected to their WiFi, the connection is still pretty weak. The sangria is strong and full of flavor. Definitely recommend it. Some people from our group had other drinks and enjoyed them as well. I am looking forward to returning to Blend on the Water again for brunch and trying it out for dinner as well."
497,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I've been here too many times to count and the service provided this time around was atrocious. I missed a reservation for 6 people, by a FEW minutes due to unforeseen traffic. I called and informed we would be late. My mom and my sister walked in explaining the situation just to be ignored and be given attitude by a short girl with long dark hair. It's unwelcoming people like these that compromise businesses. Long story short, we ended up having to wait MORE THAN 2 HOURS after we were told the wait time is ONLY 2 hrs after we missed the reservation. Every time we checked in at the counter with your hostesses, they counted down the time (you've been here 51 mins, 1 hr, 30 mins, etc) as if they have some sort of hierarchy. What happened when you have me waiting for more than 2 hours? I could've been to another venue, and home. I stuck around because it was an important occasion and I set my mind for ONLY a 2 hour wait time. Word of advice.... it's better to over estimate for a customer than under estimate. It was complete bullshit what was going on. So many people leaving and entering. How hard was it to put 3 tables of 2 together? You had me waiting for parties of 12 and 16. I ended up speaking to a supervisor and he said he would get back to me on the situation, he never did. He was too busy cleaning tables although he was aware of the commotion going on in his restaurant. I was told I would see him throughout dining, and the funny part is... I never did. Is this how you guys run business when you have unhappy customers? You seem like you don't want to be bothered and settle problems that can be avoided. This is what managers at most places of business Shout out to you Amanda, after all the frustration was let out, at least we came to terms that this was a really ridiculous situation and I appreciate you taking in all the constructive criticism. Overall - atmosphere, food, drinks and waitress.... you guys were top notch and still have a 5 in my books :)."

499,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Second time at this restaurant and they exceeded my expectations. Food was amazing as usual. Prices are VERY reasonable. The location is great! Minus the fact that it's freezing outside, the water side is beautiful after a nice dinner! Our waitress Alyssa was lovely! She was extremely attentive and very helpful since we were all very undecided! She took her time out to explain many things. I love the fact that everyone was so kind also! Even the doormen were kind to make sure I was okay after waiting forever for my car. Valet took an extremely long time to get my car though, and when they did, 3 guys came out of it. Not sure what that was about... The doorman came outside thinking they valet guys made a mistake also! Made me a bit worried. Valet service is where I took one star away from. It shouldn't take 20 minutes for me to get my car when it's not that busy, with 3 guys coming out the car. Overall, the restaurant is great and I will be coming back!!!!"
500,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This place was really nice and I think I would've loved it more had the service been a little better$ It's definitely one of the better places Long Island City has to eat. There's a beautiful view of the city where you can take Instagram worthy pictures. I came here to celebrate my birthday. There was a few things about my last experience that bothered me though. I made a reservation two weeks in advance and still waited about half an hour before I was seated. I felt like my server was a little inattentive when I first arrived. I waited about 10 minutes for her to come and acknowledge my table. We had ordered appetizers and drinks. My appetizers arrived in a timely manner, however- it took about a half hour for my drinks to arrive. Another thing that kind of took me by surprise was that she walked away right after she took our drink and appetizer order when I was already ready to order everything in one shot. By the time she came back to take our order, a table that arrived after us had gotten their entrees already. On top of that, we literally still had menus when the appetizers arrived and we had to sit the menus on our laps while we ate our appetizers which made things kind of awkward. I had the crispy arepas for the app, the sangria (it was delicious!) and the churrasco. The food was great, but the service really lacked and it kind of put a damper on my night. I would go back, maybe at a different point in the night or make my reservation earlier than my intended time to be seated."
501,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came here for my cousin's birthday. We ordered the guacamole and the arepas for appetizers and they were delicious! The churrasco was on point (esas habichuelas rojas were so good).To be honest, the service could be faster but I kind of used to being patient when it comes to latin restaurants. Our waitress was very nice and proactive and even sang Happy Birthday.I recommend this place for dates since it's very romantic. Also try lomo saltado, it's flavorful."
502,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Was seated immediately at the table requested. Used my free sangria upon check-in. Had the deviled eggs as an appetizer and the arroz con mariscos for my entree. The food was yummy and flavorful. It was a birthday celebration so they brought out cake with sparklers which was also yummy. I will say that as it gets closer to dinner time, it's almost too dark. The menus are illuminated but it will be hard to see your food in front of you. I would definitely go back here again. Wonderful food, great service and the view is to die for!"
503,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I have visited all three locations . For obvious reasons this one has the best view. The best view also attracts a lot of other things to look at ! :-) I would recommend making reservations Thursday to Sunday . The vibe is upbeat , the music is good, the ambiance is great and the food is on par with what you would expect from blend . This is more of a boutique style Spanish menu... what I mean by that is don't expect the entire pork shoulder on a plate like other establishments . All the food is presented nicely and has a balance of good flavors. I am a whiskey drinker and they serve healthy portions with large block ice which is a plus. Visit all three locations . If you are single visit blend Astoria or Blend on the Water. If you are with a date ... Blend on the Water and for lunch blend on land :-)."
504,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Oh man, so disappointed! :-( 1 star for great location(right by Gantry Park that overlooks the Hudson river and NYC) and tasty sangria, that's all I can say.  Food was mediocre, service sucked...we went for my Parents birthdays on Memorial day, we waited almost 2 HOURS, yes you read that right, just to get our food, which was cold and tasteless, not to mention the fact that your entree is like appetizer size portions! Small. I was still hungry. That day was not packed, we still dont know why it took that long to get our food.  Also beware when you pay with your credit card and you are in a party of 5 or more, obviously the tip is already included on your bill but when the waitress ran my credit card, I was charged $21 extra, when I questioned this, I was told I must have pressed the ""add tip"" button when I signed...Lies! When the waitress asked me to sign, I only signed my name and didnt press any buttons! So check that you are swiping your card for the correct amount as printed on your bill! Manager said ""that happens all the time"" wow really?? So people when they sign they mistakenly press that ""add tip"" button? Yeah right!  Needless to say, I don't plan to go back."
505,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,I normally go to the Astoria location but I decided to switch it up since it was date night & I wanted views... & I'm not just talking about my honey ;) Kimberly was our server and she was beyond fantastic. She always made sure everything that was brought out was on point and in a timely manner. She was very attentive & payed close attention to specific requests. She was very knowledgeable about the menu having find out she's Hispanic herself. She recommended some really good drink choices and food options. Churrasco with the pickled onions were my fav & so was the coconut mojito. She made our time here so pleasurable. Can't wait to be back soon!
506,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Visited Blend yesterday and had a great time. We had reservations and were seated right away. The drinks here are at a different level of AMAZING worth every penny! The appetizer were great, specially the chorizo Mac & Cheese and the short rib arepas. My salmon entree was good but not great the cilantro mash was good as well. The desert platter was out of this world so so yummy! Perfect flan and delicious ice cream!"
507,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came here with a large group of 17 for a celebration.... It was a Monday night so not crazy busy... we waited 2.5 hours for our entrees. 2.5 HOURS! Maybe even 3, we lost track. While we waited many drinks were ordered and appetizers came out around the 1 hour mark... unfortunately not everyone ordered an appetizer. While we were making the best out of the situation it's definitely something we criticized while there's a mandatory 20% gratuity on top. I guess there's nothing to work for when you know it's guaranteed.I'm hoping this situation was due to our large party and it doesn't happen regularly. Maybe it was an off night. When the food did eventually come my salmon was OK. Apps were better. I don't see myself visiting this place again for a dining experience."
508,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Very good ,  love you can reserve , they have valets parking and as of today they charge 7.00 flat rate . Food is extremely good , if you wanna celebrate birthday, you buy the cakes from them."
509,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I visited this restaurant on a Tuesday night, busy, yes. Made a reservation for 8pm. Seated at 8:40pm. Took awhile longer than I anticipated due to a reservation but we waited. Plus, we paid the valet already. In any event, I didn't have any expectations about the food. I was pleasantly surprised, it was actually good. I like to visit restaurants that have the authenticity of the culture, not water or seasoned down. The food was very good.  I had a few appetizers along with a bottle of wine. The vibe and environment is pleasing. Yes, loud but I was having a great evening because of the food, conversation and music. I will definitely visit again. I finally remember to take pics of my food. So here's a pic of our entrees. Oh, our waitress and the service was amazing. Attentive. She didn't tell us her name but she was great. Visit and happy eat!"
510,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Very rude personal from the front door bouncer, the reservation desk to the waitresses . I live in luxury building across and usually we have very good quality people and services around. Unfortunately Blend on Water is not one of them and most of their customers come from other areas. The location and design of the place is nice and the drinks are good but the staff and some of the customers-bad taste."
511,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Great place for dinner! Beautiful and modern interior, spacious and relaxing feel. It was very crowded when we arrived for dinner and we had to wait a bit at the bar before being seated. Service was friendly and the food was top notch. Strong latin vibes and the flavoring was absolutely scrumptious. Portions aren't huge but between apps, drinks, entree and dessert, you'll definitely leave satisfied. I wouldn't recommend sneakers and ball caps. It's a slightly classy place. Dress up a little. I would absolutely go back. New fav place. They also bought a birthday dish for me which had the awesome sparklers. Only complaint -  the bathroom is horribly lit and needs a bit more light."
512,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,second time around came for brunch last weekend with reservations -asking outside seating when i get there they tell me we don't do outside seating at brunch because it's not too busy but when I go to sit down place is packed once seated waitress took forever to come over and once there had the nastiest attitude I have seen in some time Food was still pretty good and drinks still on point pricey overall for this hoodhad arepas with short ribs poached eggs and home fries brunch mate pernil arepas were yum but way too sweet and poached eggs a little over done pernil was served shredded  and way too dry so next time i might hang at bar and just have happy hour specials which are pretty good  and a few apps
513,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Spacious loud restaurant on LIC waterfront Good food great drinks great view We went to sit on waterfront patio but it was crazy windy so they had closed it when we got there Came without reservation - next time will absolutely reserve Crazy busy on a Friday night Waited over an hour for a table at the barServers at the bar super attentive and friendly Drinks are the bomb here and not crazy expensive . Strong large and not too sweetGenerous food portions Apps we had guacamole , fried shrimp , wild mushroom flatbread Least favorite was the fried shrimp because sauce super sweet Mains arroz con mariscos, churrasco, chorizo mac and cheese and garlic shrimps The chorizo mac and cheese was so delicious smoky perfect creaminess . I couldn't get it out of my head for a week and made my version the following weekend.Dessert flan was good not the best I have been to the other Blend and preferred menu and drinks here much betterWill be back with reservation and on waterfront patio"
514,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Love this place. But MAKE RESERVATIONS! It's always packed, even during week nights. Perfect for date night, valet parking & right on the water."
515,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Everything is amazing! All the food had amazing flavor. The drinks are on point. Music is good volume, and you can go for a nice walk afterwards by the water. Very great spot !"
516,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Ive been to the original Blend but this was the first time that I have been to this location. It was much smaller than I expected but this place is pretty. It was an hour and 45 minute wait so we decided to chill at the bar and have some drinks and appetizers. We started with the tostones, wings and mojitos. The tostones are fantastic. The wings had a teriyaki sauce on them which I am not a fam of but if you like teriyaki Im sure you will enjoy them. The mojitos are good buy my gosh were they sugary!When we got to the table we ordered some skewers that tasted like the chicken satay at Phillipe Chow and it also looked like it too which I thought was odd. We also had the Piononos, which was sweet plantains with chicken picadillo. At this point I could barely fit in an entree so I ordered the short rib arepas as my main dish. Everything tasted good and the service was on point. Would I come back here? Absolutely! Would I make my way all the way here from Brooklyn? Probably not. I think I'd have to already be in Queens or LIC as I was on this occasion to pass by again. Overall it's a nice spot I am sure anyone would enjoy just make a reservation!"
517,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Being here a few times with friends. The food is great. Although it looks more like a bar, they have a good varieties of decent food on the menu. Quality of food: 5/5Service: 4.5/5Atmosphere: 5.5The check comes lighted in the background. Very cool. I will come back more for friends gathering."
518,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This review is over due. When my sister choose this place for Easter dinner, I was so looking forward to it. After all, we had gone to the sister restaurant last year and had a descent time. I was shocked to see the menus selections were so limited for the main course. I must admit the appetizers were great. They were the reason the rating is this high. It was a busy day, but we waited an hour plus with reservations. That's uncalled for. Plus the restuarant was less than clean. The waitress seemed nice, but when she told us they didnt have dessert I couldn't believe it . It was Easter Sunday and you didn't make enough desserts? We had to go to Martha's in Williamsburg to top off the meal. Some family members choose to go home though. So disappointed."
519,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,I came here to celebrate a birthday and we had an amazing time! Our waitress Kim was nothing short of amazing. She made sure we had everything we needed. Food was delicious and prompt! ALWAYS ASK FOR KIM! Thank you Kim for making sure our night was successful! Greatly appreciated!
520,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The food and drinks here have gotten a bit bad. Used to be one of my favorite spots due to location and it's amazing views. The drinks were all super sweet and so was the food. Maybe it was just an off night but definitely not worth the price.
521,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came here for my friends birthday dinner on a Thursday night. I arrived a little early so I sat at the bar until my friends arrived. They have $7 martinis all night on​ Thursday. I ordered the forbidden fruit.When we sat at our table the waitress was very nice and patient as we looked over the menu and placed our orders. I ordered the skirt steaks for dinner, I was contemplating on ordering the mussels as an appetizer but decided not to. The skirt steak was amazing the rice and beans were nicely paired with the meal. My friend ordered the seafood rice which looked good, I tried it the last time I came here for dinner but the rice was a little too wet in my opinion. My friend ordered guacamole as an appetizer which was delicious!!! And the lobster and crab meat rolls but wasn't my favorite.Cashing out went really smooth since we were paying with a card the waiter walked over and processed the order right at our table with this a device. I will definitely come back here again."
522,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The food and drinks were amazing and service top notch. The only problem i had was that i order asparagus  and i literally got string beans . The asparagus were so tiny it was halarious. Other than that the service was amazing staring  from the valet parking guy to the guy opening the door for you  to the waiter. Wow i will come back. Amazing views and food.
523,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This was so delicious. My only complaint is that I wish I had more lol. I added hot sauce to my rice just to give it a bit of a zing. The hot sauce isn't hot though, it's just tasty.Waitress Sayuri was the best."
524,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"- Birthday party central Each time I come, theres at least 6 birthday celebrations- Food is kind of salty- Awesome service- I do not like the rushed bill presentation, as the waitress stands over you. It doesn't give you time to think and calculate- Margaritas are great - Wife did not like the alcohol content coconut mojito- Don't forget to ask about (or check the menu for) daily drink special- Everything is tasty  My favorite is the mussels sauce"
525,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,I made a reservation online and they completely messed up when I got there. I waited to be seated and sat there and looked at an empty table for a good half an hour before we sat down at the same empty table that we saw. But after sitting down. The service was good. Didn't have to wait long for food . And the drinks were good. Not cheap with their liquor at all. But I'll be coming back hopefully i have a better experience next time.
526,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Great food, great service, and great prices especially during happy hour. Brian the bartender is great."
527,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"What an amazing place!!, excellent ambience, food and drinks. We celebrate ours Christmas Eve dinner. Absolutely recommended. Mario was an excellent server. |Ambience:Perfect for special occasions, you can take beautiful pictures there, the views and the decorations are five stars|Appetizers:- Crispy arepas: $13- Lobster and Crab tequeños: $15|Entrées- Churrasco: $31- Arroz con mariscos: $30 |Drinks: - La Flor: $12- La Medicina: $14- Blue Moon beer: $6|Bill:We pay about $175 for 3 people + Tip"
528,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"The location is goregous of course;  I've been here for many special occasions and they never disappoint!  Definitely the spot to celebrate, enjoy the view, great food and drinks.  Parking... Don't even worry about it, they have valet!  Which is cheap but worth it because you will not find good parking on your own, especially if you're in heels."
529,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Great seafood Arroz con mariscos. Latin America vibe, wicked caipirinhas. Thoroughly enjoyed our meal.  Rose Sangria is also good."
530,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"The food was delicious! Fresh orange juice mimosas are awesome, the service was great too, nice view"
531,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Skirt steak is phenomenal.  It just has so much flavor. Made a reservation for 4 and we were seated right away, no wait on a Saturday at 7pm. One person we were with had the skirt steak as well and happened to overcook it twice, third one was perfect,  and they comped that dish for the inconvenience.  Listen no place is perfect but the way they handled the situation and the customer service is what we left remembering. Rosè sangria was good (a little on the sweet side). Guac and chips appetizer was excellent.  This was my second time visiting, driving took me an hour from long Island but definitely worth the drive and I hope I can get there again soon!"
532,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This is my 3rd visit to Blend Long Island City.Take my stupid advice. Please make a reservation especially for the weekends.This place is packed and rightfully so, the food and drinks are AMAZING..for the location the prices are extremely competitive. It's right by the water so the ambience is pretty cool too. My only issue was with service. The waitresses always seemed in a rush and very abrupt. I understand you're busy and all but welcome to the service industry. If you must serve then do it right or not at all. If a customer is making small talk with you be friendly ... Despite the service I would definitely recommend. Remember the reservation."
533,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Brunch reviewWent there with girlfriends on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. The food was better than I expected as I am not crazy about latin american food but wow it was delicious! I had the Huevos Rancheros with scrambled eggs instead of sunny side up. It was delicious I cleaned that plate in no time. My friends had the Chicken Vacafrita and the Pernil, both delicious. Cool space but slow service. They were really busy when we left around 2pm so I'd strongly suggest a reservation. I would love to come back for dinner with a night view of the city."
534,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I haven't been to Blend on the Water in years, because they're usually crowded. But with Friday's beautiful weather we wanted to sit outside. Blend didn't disappoint, they actually stepped their game up. Wait time was minimal and we were seated outside as requested when we made the reservations. Though it was still quite early, we had 5:45 reservations, and were seated a bit after 6 since one of our friends didn't get there until almost 6. The drinks are always consistent, I always get the PassionFruit Mojito, a bit sweet for my liking but it's a good strong. My friends like there Coconut Mojito and Mango Margarita on the rocks. The guacamole is always good. It's our go to app, not discussions needed. They add a good amount of jalapeños when you order it spicy, and the chips are house made. We also ordered the Poke Tacos, which were loaded with fresh yummy tuna atop of the traditional taco condiments. All in all very refreshing, I'd strongly recommend it. For the entree, I ordered the garlic and oil shrimp with fettuccine. The dish appeared small but was quite filling. The shrimps were decent in size, and the pasta was cooked well. There was fresh tomatoes diced into the garlic and oil, garlic was just rite, oil was a bit much. But good none the less. One of my friends ordered the Salmon, very decent in size and served with charred cherry tomatoes (yum). Pineapple reduction (yum, again) and asparagus. Nothing spectacular, but surely good. The seared Tilapia with coconut sauce was delicious. The coconut sauce was fitting, not overwhelmingly sweet and perfectly present in the mean. Coconut sauce can sometimes overwhelm the dish.  Not in this case, everything went together well. We didn't have any room for desserts, maybe next time."
535,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,This is the third time I've gone here and the food is always great! We had a server her name was Charline and she was sooooo nice! She made sure we were always good on drinks and made us all feel extremely comfortable. I definitely will be coming back soon!
536,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"My husband surprised me with a dinner to Blend on the Water and I can't thank him enough.  You can't help but to see how beautiful the restaurant is from the outside but when you go inside, it's even more beautiful and looking out at the water.We had a reservation and since out entire party wasn't there yet, we sat at the bar.  We ordered Passion Fruit Mojitos at the bar and they were pretty weak so we asked the bartender to pour a little bit more alcohol in them and then they were good.  The last of my party showed up so we were seated promptly and the waiter came and took our drink and appetizer order - it was a Tuesday and they have a special on Mojitos, so we ordered those again.  These time they were delicious.For my main course, I ordered a pernil with rice and it tasted good but I've had better elsewhere, nonetheless, everyone did enjoy their meals and we were plenty satisfied.Overall: Good food, fantastic service, great view - I'll definitely be back."
537,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came on Saturday around 5:30 PM. We were late for our reservation, but they were still able to squeeze us in, which I was happy about (damn NYC traffic). Luckily they have a valet service for $7, because parking was nowhere to be found. The place is very large with high ceilings and lots of windows. The ambiance is really nice at night, when you can actually see the bridge on the water. During the day, there is a lot of natural lighting. For an appetizer, we got the piononos, which had garlic chicken and sweet plantains. This was a great appetizer, as it had a variety of flavors. The sweetness paired with the garlic chicken was nice. I also got a lychee mojito, which was incredible and came with real sugar cane. As an entree, I got the salmon, which was really finely seasoned and cooked. It came with asparagus, which was cooked tender and also had good flavor. Complemented very well by the pineapple reduction sauce that it was placed in. The mashed potatoes seemed like they were pureed a bit thin for my liking--it was hard to even get them on my fork--but the flavor of the potatoes made the salmon really excellent. My boyfriend got the filet mignon (medium-well), which I had a bite of, and it was great. Since it was someone's birthday, we did do a dessert; we got the sampler of 3 different cakes; the chocolate, the Pina colada, the coconut flan, and a scoop of vanilla ice cream. It came with a nice fancy sparkler. The chocolate cake was EXTREMELY rich. Like, I'm talking you can't have two bites without having a gulp of water in between. It was perfect for a chocolate lover like me. The Pina colada was a lighter cake, with real pineapples over the top. Coconut flan was good as well. I have to give only 4 stars because of the service--our waitress was a bit dismissive, and kept trying to walk away before we could even finish a sentence. I understand that the restaurant is busy on a Saturday night, but your job will be easier if you actually listen to people before you walk away and they end up having to flag you down again just for a refill or bottle of hot sauce."
538,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Came here for a birthday brunch Saturday at 1:30pm and it was quiet packed. Definitely make reservations ahead of time. Delicious food with a view. Blend is located alongside LIC pier and although it's not the best view of the pier, there's still something to look at. Although parking is hard to find around the area, the restaurant provides valet parking for $7. Upon entering, 4/5 guests were present, but we had to wait for the entire party to be seated. I mean, makes sense for a restaurant that's so busy. We got the churrasco with eggs, seafood paella, and guac. The churrasco was delicious; meat was cooked to order and was paired so well with their savory chimichurri. However, the eggs were kind of nasty. We ordered 3 plates of churrasco with eggs and all 3 plates of eggs were undercooked and tasted cold. My boyfriend liked the seafood paella a lot; loaded with tons of real crabmeat and other yummy seafood. The seafood paella is definitely shareable amongst two, he was barely able to finish half on his own and had to take it to go (no complaints there, so worth the price). The guacamole was mediocre, nothing special, probably would've tasted better with a drizzle of lime. Our server was kind. We brought cake and decided last minute we didn't want to eat it there and she still lit up a sparkler candle for us to take pictures and repacked our cake. If you're in the mood for some Spanish food, definitely make sure to check the place out! I'd say it's worth the travel, but remember to make reservations!"
539,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,The food was very tasty we had to wait a longggg time because we didn't have a reservation and it was graduation week. However the food was really good and the drinks were even better. We had a really nice waitress also
540,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I get people come here for the view. But the food is underwhelming, regular. The service is trashhhhhh. You don't get seated right away even with a reservation. The servers take forever. They don't even partner with you beforehand to let you know they're busy. Just the worst. Just because you have a restaurant in the best real estate in Queens, does not mean you're allowed to provide trash service and mediocre food."
541,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Hands down the best Mojitos, multiple flavors! Come with a sugar cane stick in it, that's super cute! Also the crispy arepas are soooo delicious! Highly recommend evening or weekend lunch time! It has a spectacular view of the NYC skyline!"
542,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,I celebrated my 35th bday here and I loved it the food was great the price point was ridiculously affordable and the drinks were to die for it's a Latin restaurant so I get that they play Latin music but they should switch it up a little the only thing I did not like we had reservations and we still had to wait to be seated
543,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"It was okay, you get a free drink when you check in on the app. Food was good small portion but good. Nice view! Waiters are cool as well"
544,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Angelica was the best server ever!!! Lovely smile!! And great hospitality. Would definitely come back!
545,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Food was excellent especially the tequeños and camarones al ajilo my drinks were ok I really like the views over looking the water .you can dress up here or you can wear Jean's and sneakers alot of bday parties givin here and it cld get pretty packed the servers were really nice and welcoming .my waiter giselle she was a sweet heart and the host lance was also great my only downfall was the wait time for food and drinks it was a little ridiculous and they have is the menu but didnt give us the drink menu so we ended up ordering our food before our drinks which was a little crazy but over all I had a good experience I will be returning in the future the bldgs in the are so beautiful so u can leave there and catch the nice views overlooking the park area a little further dwn or just go for a nice walk in the area ...you can make a full day out of just hangin in the area.
546,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Beautiful atmosphere and views! Food and drinks are amazing! One of my favorite places to go when out with friends !!!!
547,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,One of the hottest days of the year (112 degrees F) and with reservations we were not allowed to enter the restaurant because we had sandals not a closed pair of shoes. Absolutely ridiculous!! No restaurant is worth that torture. Nope!!
548,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"This place is absolutely overhyped and overpriced. I, as well as many other Yelp reviewers, are shocked by the plethora of high-rated reviews. My friends and I made a reservation for a Friday night to celebrate a birthday. I would highly recommend making a reservation, especially for Friday-Sunday. The restaurant was completely packed. Prior to arrival, I was a little stressed out about what to wear since the restaurant enforces a strict dress code that is posted on their main website as well as on the Open Table e-mail confirmation. However, they seem to contradict each other on whether or not sneakers are allowed. On Open Table, it says sneakers are allowed (with a collared shirt and blazer), but boots of any kind are not allowed? On their main website, sneakers are not allowed. Since this was a birthday dinner, I didn't want to get turned away for not abiding by their dress code. I ended up wearing straight black jeans, a plaid collared button down shirt, blue blazer, and Oxford boots, and thankfully didn't get turned away. Aside from their confusing dress code, here are some other of their other house rules:1) they don't seat you unless your whole party is present2) there is a 15 minute grace period to hold your reservation before your table is given away- plan accordingly, the closest train station (21st Street/Jackson Avenue on the G-line) is approximately a 15-minute walk to the restaurant3) Yelp check-in for 1 free Sangria- only applies to Monday-Thursday, but the 7% Yelp cash-back applies to Monday-Friday4) there's an automatic 20% gratuity for parties of 6+5) another Yelper mentioned that you're required to order an entree, regardless of how many appetizers/desserts/drinks you order (I'm not sure how true this is since I didn't personally experience this)- but, worth a mentionThe restaurant is beautiful and has high ceilings and floor-to-ceiling windows with panoramic views of the East River, the Queensboro Bridge, and the East side of Manhattan. They also have menus/receipt folders that blind your eyes with fluorescent light because the restaurant is so dark and you can't read the menu without it. The whole experience was a complete let down. I felt like this place was ""trying too hard"" with an air of pretentiousness/stuffiness from the dress code, to the Guido bouncer/doorman/gatekeeper, to the overdone, heavy-make-up hostess + waitress, down to the bathroom attendant. Listen, this is Long Island City. This isn't even a Michelin-rated restaurant (far from it). It's not Per Se, it's not Le Bernardin, it's just not of that caliber.The food isn't spectacular and the prices are considerably high. My meal was also interrupted at least 5 separate times by sparklers- by, the 4th or 5th time I saw a dessert with sparklers, the excitement had already worn off and I was getting annoyed. Overall, I wouldn't recommend coming here. The view is nice, but aside from that, the restaurant is really far- isolated from the rest of LIC- probably great for people who live at or near the LIC waterfront and are limited in dining options. The food and drinks aren't anything special and the ambiance was too much of that of a nightclub you'd find in the Meatpacking District- it just wasn't my scene. I would rather eat at a restaurant down the street on Vernon Blvd."
549,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"First things first, I was blown away by the breath taking scene you get right by the water and the beautiful city. Came here today for mine and my mother's birthday and everything was fantastic and perfect . Lets start off with the apps! I choseeee the guacamole and chips. Omg, the flavor, the zest, the freshnessss dear Lord i have sinned haha. Then the mushroom flat bread. Deeeeelicious till the last bite. Fresh mozzarella cheese anddddd, GOAT CHEESE . Can't knock it till you try it. 10 out of a 10. Thennnnn we got the corn, the ""Marasca"" sorry if i spelt it wrong HOWEVER, there were only 3 pieces but they were bites of heavennnn. Restrooms were pretty poppin too if I may say. Theres a lady waiting for you after you're done with your bizzznes and waits for you with the water running andddd a paper towel  it was brilliant. Threw her $2 for being sweet and thoughtful. Our waitress Kimberly was THE SWEETEST and so loving. Mouth watering. My mother ordered the tilapia following some delicious white rice and my father ordered the grilled chicken, MUAH! Delisioso . My sister and I ordered the Churasco..THE PHENOMENAL mouth watering steak with these red onionssss that had this lemon squeeeeze and lemme finish...TOSTONASS. The whole meal was just amazing and you just had to be there to witness and exxxperience this fantasy of food brought to me. Take a little trip down to Long Island City, and folks you will not be disappointed. Fantastic atmosphere, fantastic staff, phenomenal food!"
550,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"I came here for brunch with a group of friends. It was great! We got a booth near the windows facing the water. The view was a beautiful view of Manhattan, I would come back for dinner just to see the view at night! We started off with mojitos and mimosas and the fresh made guacamole. All of them were delicious.Between us, we had pernil, taquitos de carne, blended burger, mofongo con camarones the French toast, and of course tostones. All of them were prepared beautifully and tasted amazing. I would say the best dish we had was the French toast or the mofongo because of garlic butter sauce! The service was good and quick! And I would definitely come back here for another visit!"
551,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,One of my favorite Latin restaurants. I've had THE best AREPAS at this place. I recommend their huevos rancheros any time. Great brunch place literally by the river! Only complaint is the wait time but the food is worth the wait!!!
552,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"Getting a reservation was simple and the drinks were delicious. It was an overcast evening so we didn't get to enjoy the backdrop as much, but it was still quite beautiful. The food was pretty good, and I'd def come again.We had the deviled eggs, guacamole, the lobster pastry, pernil and rice, and the arroz con mariscos. The pork was sooo tender."
553,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,Great spot for a night out. Amazing scenery and food. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for birthdays or any other special occasion.
554,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"So many great things to say about this restaurant,the food, the view, the staff just amazing.We had a birthday reservation for 15 ppl and each one of us loved the service. Our waitress was very patient and sweet her name was Sayuri. We were a very picky group a lot of confusion on picking time, meal etc . That's when a very nice gentleman Lance came to the rescue and helped us pick something that we would all like and enjoy.Lance and sayuri thank you for making our first time at Blend a beautiful memorable night.The food is excellent we all had a different plate from the menu and everything taste very good.The view is so beautiful and romantic.Will go again with more friends and family ."
555,Hh9glEE_xDYT_pPUsRPXlA,"After a morning in LIC, my friends and I stopped by Blend for lunch. It was their second time, but it was my first time. I personally ordered the Taquitos De Carne. Except for the fact that it was corn-based tacos, I liked everything else from the rice/beans/meat bites. I ended up eating everything with a fork cause it was getting messy. But, it was good.Besides the food, the thing that made this place special was the fact that I got a birthday candle and my friends and I got to get free dessert on the house for sharing a picture to social media. They offer many small perks like this among other things. They don't ask questions and are generous in doing so. That's what made me like this place even more."
556,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,Typical Chinese restaurant... But considering the other option two blocks away this place is very very very good.
557,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"I've been a loyal customer for a year and have never ever complained about the service as I was very happy with my food and the service i was receiving . Today I order my usual "" spare rib tips ( with short bone )with pork fried rice ""  and it came with BBQ sauce which it never has before . I called and spoke to manager "" Kate"" and explained I was allergic and who at first understood and said she would replace my order ( just the meat ) She requested separate my food and give her driver just the meat portion of my order . I gladly said sure will do . Shortly after Kate called and stated she would not replace my order . I explained I've been a loyal customer and never once complained and said anything and didn't understand why . Kate was unbothered by me . Worst customer service . I suggest no one ever have a problemWith your order because they don't care to lose customers"
558,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"Wanted a quick meal and of course went to the best choice in nyc for fast delivery. I ordered the panda special #2- general tsos with chicken and broccoli with fried rice and wontons. The general tso was just ok, the chicken from the broccoli section was chewy and the sauce was practically soy so salty as heck. The fried wontons were the best part but hard to mess that up. The fried rice needed flavor but mixed it with the general tso's sauce so that helped. This was the highest rated chinese store in the vicinity so will just hit up the nearby pizza joint or taco truck. No type of rush is worth wasting $9 at lunch time."
559,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,I've been eating here for about 20 years. It's one of my go-to Chinese restaurants. The delivery service is quick and the people are always friendly. I've must've eaten a dozen different items from the menu. Never had a bad experience. It does get a little packed but they manage everything very well.
560,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"Food was delivered fast. Accurate, and great prices. Food taste great. Def great fast meal."
561,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,It's an average take-out American Chinese restaurant. Nothing special but good to satisfy a Chinese take out craving.
562,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"Based on over a dozen orders, not one. I say they're truly awesome. The fried rice is perfectly cooked and tasty (every time). The service is excellent as well. Truly nice people. I'm that annoying customer that always either forgets something and has to call twice or doesn't have enough $ and they are soo sweet, every time. Never have an attitude even when my dogs bombard the poor delivery guy. The time I didn't have the money together, it took me forever to gather it. The lady not only held my order but kept it on the warmer and when I finally got there she said ""I got worried about you, what happened ? No attitude - Can't buy that these days.. Worth it and then some. Forever my favorite"
563,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"Great food, great family running it. Sometimes, rarely, get your order wrong. Be sure to speak very clearly on the phone."
564,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"the best Chinese spot in the hood the tso chicken always on point and with veggies and the delivery guy is amazing always hooks it up always smiling even says hi to us just walking down the street he is the homie, just make sure you tip them well too many broke people who don't tip these heard working peoples."
565,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,I had the General Tso chicken with white meat and it was close to what I get in Nj. Overall pretty good nice and crispy the way it should be. Best so far in the BX I've tried.
566,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,Good food. Excellent delivery service.  They actually go inside the apt building to your door to delivery the food. Unlike other delivery service that calls you and asks you to come outside smh.
567,W66iSwQ8pWgxOT3Ss97vpw,"They actually make the seame chicken CRISPY!!  I am a loyal fan.  Beware the brown rice, though, it's a little mushy.  Deliver guy is super nice.  We threw all our other Chinese take out menus in the garbage..."
568,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Cafe Royale is a pleasant diner in this section of the Bronx.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The diner itself is somewhat old fashioned looking in a good way and it feels like you're back in another era.  The menu has all of the diner breakfast and Greek food classics, but I saw on the back of the menu a Mexican specialities section, and so I assumed maybe these would be pretty legit.  I opted for the shrimp quesadilla and enjoyed it.  It wasn't super flavorful but hit the spot for a quick sit down lunch.  The accompanying salsa was probably the only downside.  I was naively expecting some sort of authentic Mexican salsa but it was definitely just mild American salsa that you can buy in a bottle.  The guacamole was also bland.  All in all though I left full and content.  Recommended!  A solid diner."
569,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"I've been coming to this diner for over a decade. This place is the perfect diner. The food has always been great except one occasion. My mom ordered an omelette and it was burnt and disgusting and my pancakes were burnt. When the waitress realized my mom didn't eat her food, they did not charge her for her meal. Besides this incident, I really like this place. It's my go to diner. They have delivery, pick up service, and take out. The waitresses are friendly and this place is pretty clean. Most importantly it's very affordable."
570,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"The recommended buffet down the street was closed on Mother's Day, so I had a late breakfast at Cafe Royale. They don't take credit cards, but the prices are reasonable enough that it's only an inconvenience, not a real problem.My veggie omelet was big and tasty, the coffee was above average, and the service was prompt and super friendly."
571,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,Being that this place is near my job and they deliver this is a go to spot for my job......I have had breakfast there a few times and it was simply ok....nothing to go out your way for.....however the lunch is much better.....or rather the Dominican food they serve is much better.......it is very on point.....since they remodeled their prices went up.... but it's still ok......two downfalls of this place.......if you go in the summer this is NO AC......and be it delivery or on site they ONLY accept cash.....
572,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"The place is renovatedThey have better seating compared to previous years, more vegan choices Good service and good good Place is now CASH ONLY"
573,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,I came here few times. Near by subway and good location. Just needed A/C today! Very hot outside...Foods are generally okay. Good services!
574,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Today was out first time dining here and it has become our 2nd favorite breakfast spot.  Everything we had was good, especially the coffee!!  Our waitress, Veronica, was pleasant and attentive to us as well.  For vegfie lovers, the Garden Omelette was delicious.  We will definitely come back again."
575,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,This is not a fancy restaurant at all but its pretty clean.The food is good and always prepared well but nothing special. Their are so many menu choices that i couldnt really recommend whats best. The service is decent but the staff tends to be a bit unfriendly. I can't say that  Ive ever seen any of them come across as rude but you will not get a smile here or a friendly hello. Food delieveries are prompt.
576,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Oh, hell yeah! Sunlight is THE place to go in the Bronx.  All positives here. Good food, good prices, classic New York diner atmosphere. Yankees fans heaven.  They're just doing it right.  Eat in, take out. Just go to the Sunlight!  Just remember, it's cash only, that's the only thing I'd change."
577,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Okay so I ordered a Ham, Egg, Provalone Cheese with mayo/tomato on a hard roll. Not too hard right? I didn't think so, especially since this is a restaurant,  and that is your one job, to get my order right. I got a Bacon, Egg, Provolone cheese, on a roll, plain...  for $4.25, with only 1 egg...Not gonna lie, just a little embarrassing....Never again."
578,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"If you're not sure what to order, the great thing about Sunlight is that it probably has any of your cravings on their menu. Sunlight has an old school diner feel to it with servers who are attentive and friendly. You walk in and you feel like you've traveled back in time to what diners should be like. I like that the place is not too big, its just big enough. The feel in Sunlight is retro for sure, I find the pink seating to be charming.Working near by I do not always have time to go out and look for what I want to eat. Going to Sunlight, you know you will find a great option and wont have to wait too long to get served. Even when they are super busy with their morning crowd, they still aim to please and make sure your order is correct. Whether your ordering for take out or dining in you will be happy with your service.Sunlight is very generous with their portion sizes as well. If you weren't that hungry, you will be leaving with leftovers. Sunlight is reasonably priced for the most part. You get a healthy size of food regardless of your order. They can get pricey with the add ons so if you're on a tight budget just make sure to ask for the prices. The friendly staff is more than happy to accommodate.I enjoy breakfast most of all at Sunlight. If I need to take it to go, my favorite order is the egg sandwich on toast. If I'm sitting, one of the more hearty breakfast choices is the way to go. They have yummy pancakes and will put anything into an omelet! (again will satisfy any craving). Other than that the food is pretty decent. If I could change something it would be their shoestring french fries. I love French fries, hear me out, but not shoe string fries, I find them to be too skinny and not crunchy enough. Other than that I'm usually pretty happy with my service at Sunlight. Its a great go to reliable spot in the area for a causal and relaxing meal."
579,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,Good food and good service. Large menu with lots of options. Authentic NY diner feel. Would cone back if I'm in the area.
580,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Great food with great prices. I've ordered breakfast, lunch and dinner and I've never been disappointed with my choices. The restaurant is operated by Mexicans yet there is a variety of items on the menu: Mexican/American/Greek as well as other Latin countries. Amazingly everything is cooked to perfectly right. I never hesitate in ordering out or dining in."
581,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Dropped by for lunch after class around 1p and was able to catch their lunch specials from 11a-3p and had a great meal. They have $8 lunches that include chicken/beef/oxtail/pork with rice & beans, salad & toasted bread along with a free drink of ur choice. Portions were large and it tasted good. Cant go wrong. Service was very friendly and fast. Very pleased. They have also fish and other dishes too but those were for $12 and higher i believe. Only accept cash though."
582,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Visited this place because it had great reviews. The three of us were seated quickly for brunch. The brunch was delicious and the portions were large. Really enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice! I can't wait to go back and get it again. However, the service could have been better - it was inattentive and impatient, we didn't feel the staff were very welcoming. Also the hash browns were so greasy they were nearly inedible. I'll give this place another chance and will make a final judgment then."
583,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,I found it to be just ok. Pros:Bang for the buckCourteous staffCons:Food is so-so.Some booths have exhausted the seat cushioning.As far as diners go Sunlight Restaurant has that authentic look with a worn appearance that teases your senses into thinking you're about to experience an incredible meal for a fantastic price.  But that's just you.  Sunlight gets pretty high marks from many other reviewers but I couldn't see it from their point of view.  The meals taste average in that they're not overly lacking but they're also unremarkable.  Booth seats are *really* worn out.  I did appreciate the staff cooperating with each other and being attentive about service when a particular table was not assigned to them.
584,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"I like this place, used to come here since my high school days and is pretty much the same. The food is decent and so are the prices. This place is definitely worth coming by for some panfish food and a solid breakfast."
585,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"It's a love/hate relationship with this place. The food is cheap and the portions are good but whenever I order, they seem to mess up at least one thing whether it be greasy maduros, missing orange juice, or something else. Also would be nice if they took cards instead of forcing you to have cash or use their ATM machine."
586,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"I come here all the time. The food is great, and the service is friendly and fast. I come here so often that the ladies already know what I'm getting. The coffee is always delicious and I really like the oatmeal. Sadly it's cash only but they do have an ATM inside. They also deliver and will actually come all the way upstairs which if you're from the south Bronx you know is rare. Definitely recommend this place for breakfast."
587,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,I come here often and I order from here frequently because I work right by this diner. They have very reasonably priced meals and the portion and quality is good as well. The staff is always friendly and attentive. I love their breakfast choices like the lumberjack which included pancakes choice of bacon sausage or ham with eggs your choice of style. I also tried their nachos delicious!!! Their tacos are delicious and tasty as well. They deliver very promptly as well overall this place is a win win. I always have a great experience eating here.
588,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Stopped in here, not expecting much to be honest. I was pleasantly surprised though, the service was prompt and friendly. Prices were reasonable and my Reuben was terrific. Glad I stopped in!"
589,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Very disappointed. Came here for my lunch break and ordered a Gyro, the gyro was very bland. The chicken was over-cooked and their white sauce was basically sour cream watered down. I had to put tons of salt and pepper (even added ketchup and hot sauce) to make this taste good. Then the other problem was that the gyro on their menu is supposed to be $4.75 (very cheap) yet when I received my bill it was $9 for just one gyro? According to them it was due to tax and tip but double the price is ridiculous. Tax is 8% and tip is 16-20% depending on the service and if you sit at the counter tip shouldn't be included it should definitely be optional for us customer to calculate ourselves. I was charged 50% tax/tip without a choice, that is outrageous especially for a diner! I feel cheated and I'm never coming back!"
590,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Cheap, quality food here. It is cash only, but there is an ATM on sight. I had a lumberjack breakfast for under $9?!!!!?!. The wait staff was very attentive to us. No one tried to rush us out once we finished our food and got the bill. I live all the way in Long Island City, and I would consider taking the train up to the bronx to have breakfast here."
591,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"A Latino diner in the South Bronx. It's awesome. Since I work and live within walking distance, I eat in the Sunlight probably 5 or 6 times a week. It's my favorite local diner, and the breakfasts are quick and inexpensive. The service is so excellent. I know all the waitresses by now, and they recognize and greet their regular customers by name. It really makes for a friendly, happy meal. I think the best thing about the Sunlight is the daily lunch special. Ready instantly, and always great. My favorite is oxtails with sweet plantains. It is cash only, but there is an ATM right there. Remember to tip properly, as the ladies really do deserve the consideration. They deliver, and quickly at that."
592,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Imagine a diner that has every item on their menu taste amazing. Look no further..Sunlight Restaurant it is. As a former student at a nearby College campus, Sunlight has been a favorite spot for me amongst many other students where food is not only reasonably priced, but also very satisfying! One important mention is the staff...they are INCREDIBLE. Attentive, caring, and always deliver. I'm not saying this because all my experiences there has been delivered with great customer service, but because the atmosphere as a whole resonates to my feelings as well. So if you're in Grand Concourse via 149th, give this place a shot! It will be well worth the score."
593,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"I love coming to the Sunlight for Brunch.  Ir's hard to find good food and good service in the Bronx, but this is a must.  It's awesome for Yankee fans, come here before an afternoon game and you won't be disappointed.  A bit of a walk to the stadium, but worth it for the eats!  Good food - farmer's omelette for 7.95. Comes out fast and cooked the way you like it!  Wait staff are friendly and there is never a rush to get you out the door.  Sometimes there's a bit of a wait to be seated, but this intimate diner experience is worth it.  Definitely coming back for brunch!"
594,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Family and myself love this place. Friendly staff, great food. I always get the sunlight omelette, kids love the pancakes and the grilled cheese. Free coffee refills, which is good for a hangover. Must go early, gets really crowded."
595,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,If I'm working in the a.m I am at Sunlight eating pancakes to start my day
596,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"I've been here twice after running errands in the Bronx, and I absolutely love this diner! Very rare to find one these days uptown. The prices are very reasonable and I never have to wait for a seat. So far I've only ordered the lumberjack breakfast, and it always hits the spot! The staff is attentive and the food is prepared quickly. Already looking forward to my next visit!"
597,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,"Nice spot for an easy bite.  The corned beef is amazing!!! Very good quality, not fatty.  They r cash only FYI!"
598,rzTDNNnqksThPVu2lvI2fQ,It's a cozy little neighborhood joint with decent diner food.  They offer some mexican specialties that are kind of mediocre considering the fact that they are cooked by Mexicans.  I think they would do best by sticking with the diner fare.
599,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This is our go to spot in the area. We walk in and the staff greets us with hugs. The atmosphere is amazing. A great place to enjoy a glass (or bottle of wine). The wine selection is great, they have happy hour every day which is nice. The food is great. They are tapas so they are not the hugest servings but everything is delicious. The yuca fries and mini cachapas are my go to. Ellen the sommlier is such a sweetheart. She always gives us new wine to taste and ensures we are taken care of. The servers always make sure we are okay and are great people. Some Fridays they have live jazz which is also great. Long story short we love coming to Barepas. If you're in the area definitely stop by and you wont regret it."
600,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This place was great. We went this past Wednesday night on a whim. There were maybe 3 other tables there when we arrived, but the waiter was super attentive. He made some great suggestions on wine and food.We got the yucca fries, reina pepiada arepas (chicken salad inside cilantro infused arepa), amanecida arepas (pulled pork inside a sweet plantain and corn flour mixed arepa), and the red wine marinated beef sliders with brie, carrots, honey and ginger between a crispy but tender corn arepa shell. We finished with the torta fría, which was essentially chocolate pudding with layers of vanilla cake. Let me just say we were basically licking the plates clean.Our favorites were the sliders and amanecida arepas, but the torta was amazing too. The waiter came over to chat about the food after and tell us some of the cool things that go on there (live jazz music!). We will definitely be coming back soon!"
601,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"My new favorite spot! I've been eyeing this place since my boyfriend and I passed it one day. The atmosphere and decor is very inviting. This is THE perfect place for a date night or just to catch up with an old friend. There is a large table near the bar for a larger group and plenty of tables throughout the restaurant. The staff is super friendly, attentive and willing to answer any question you may have. A large part of the menu is served tapas style. A must have is the mini cachapas and the yuca fries. The cachapas are a perfect combination of sweet and savory. The yuca fries are so well presented and fried to perfection. There is also a really great happy hour which is $6 for a glass of wine. I will definitely be coming back here!"
602,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Based on the reviews, my friend and I decided to check this spot out. We got there on a Friday at around 6pm and no one was inside besides the staff. We took a seat and were quickly welcomed. We asked if they had happy hour but they said it's only Mon- Thu. (Ya'll definitely need to change that and have happy hour on Fridays as well. Perhaps it wouldn't have been so dead inside). We ordered a glass of rosé and some yucca fries which were bomb. Overall the place is super cute and I like the decor. I'd come back again."
603,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This spot had shown up on my Yelp, so I had to check it out! My friend and I came on a Friday afternoon at like 4pm and we were 2 of 4 other clients. The place is super cute and an ice place to catch up with friends. After a while more people came in and the noise started to pick up, but nothing crazy. There was also live jazz which was nice but didn't quiet fit the vibe. We shared three tapas (arepas, tostones, and tequeños) plus happy hour wine. The wine was delicious and $6! The food was good, the tequeños were so soft I could sleep on them. Would definitely come back to try more"
604,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Barepas has such a warm, comfortable atmosphere. I love the art on the wall, the hardware, and all of the wine bottles all around the restaurant. My husband and I came in for a meal, but this would be a great place to catch up with friends over wine and small plates when you're not too hungry. There's a long table attached to the bar that looks great for groups.I had the cachapas which were topped with chorizo, very tasty. I also knew I wanted an order of arepas and settled on the amanecida arepas which are made with maduros, pulled pork, and goat cheese. It was a little too sweet for my liking, but the pork and goat cheese combination was really good. If you like sweet, I highly recommend these. My husband ordered la parilla which is a combination of mixed grilled meats. The blood sausage was a bit out there for him, but the steak, chicken, chorizo, and little arepa balls were delicious. The very friendly waiter recommended wine which was perfectly paired with our meals. I think it's a great addition to the area, we'll definitely be back!"
605,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Great Ambiance and excellent food.  Waffles were light fluffy and delicious.  Chicken was perfectly seasoned.  They serve only wine, no liquor.  This is why they received 4 stars."
606,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I live just above this place so I come here all the time just to have a drink. My one suggestion to the owners is to try to get rid of that chemically-chlorine based smell that's permeated ever since the place opened. I mean, great I know you guys are clean and I love how friendly you guys are and the wine list is tolerable and the beers and foods great!!!! But if you get rid of the smell I'll upgrade to 5 stars."
607,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Amazing venezuelan food. Service was on point and the food was amazing. The atmosphere was perfect as it was so cozy!! Will deff recommend this!
608,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Amazing: the beef and blue cheese arepas were like the best thing I've eaten in the past million years. Each bite had such... depth or something. I don't know how to talk about food!I'll definitely come back to this place. I just wouldn't recommend it if you're starving because the servings are small - it's tapas after all. Eat something beforehand and then come here.
609,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I think Barepas just became one of my favorite restaurants! We came in at about 5:30pm for an early dinner. All the reviews were great so I knew we were in for a treat. First thing I noticed was the decor - very nice and industrial. I especially loved all the wine around the walls. The restaurant was pretty empty so we were tended to right away. Ellen was our server and she was very friendly and fast all throughout. They have a pretty extensive wine selection and a couple of beers. I can't recall the name of the one we selected but it was delicious. The menu is mostly composed of tapas and arepas - we went with the following: (1) Pabellon Criollo: my favorite out of all the dishes we tried, the sweet plantain with the beef and the rice fritter with the refried beans was the most perfect combination; (2) Spicy Chorizo Patacones: these mini bites of fried green plantain with cheese and chorizo were heaven sent, very flavorful; (3) Mini Empanadas: an assortment of cheese, beef, chicken and sweet plantain and I loved them all; (4) Mini Cachapas: the cheese and sweet corn tortilla were perfectly balanced; (5) Sour Mango Salad: the citrus highlights in this one were everything, the mango, radish and the sald dressing together were amazing; (6) Tequeños: very crispy and full of gooey cheese on the bite, I could've ate 5 alone; and last but not least (6) the Quesillo: the venezuelan version of the flan (custard) which was good, but I think the caramel had bourbon and it became a little too much at one point. We also had a glass of a Porto dessert wine to finish our meal which was marvelous. Additionally, they had live music for the night; we decided to stay until it started at 7:00pm and it was great. All in all a great dining experience. It's a beautiful chill spot for some good wine and delicious tapas and I'm really glad I found it. Its not cheap per say but the quality and taste of the food makes up for the prices. There's no doubt in my mind I'm going to become a regular and will be coming back veryyyy soon to try their cheese platter!"
610,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Food A+Interior A+Service BValue A-This bar is relatively new in the West Harlem area and it's clearly doing well. The arepas menu is impressive with lots of variety. I ordered cameron (shrimp with a carrot arepas) which paired great with rosé. Portions were a bit on the small side. Service was a bit slow too but not bad. A solid first impression and I'm pretty excited to come back again
611,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"That fourth star is mostly because of the nice decor of this place. It was a very warm cozy place to hang out. I noticed they changed the menu items a bit from what I saw on the pictures here. They switched the slow cooked shredded beef slider with blue cheese to pretty much a burger patty with blue cheese. It was tasty with the onions and all but not what I was hoping for/expecting. I feel generous with that 4th star bc I wasn't happy noticing the price of the blue cheese slider went up and the portion went down :( plus they switched from slow cooked beef to a burger patty :/   They went from 3 sliders to just 2 and raised the price from 16-18, that's 9 bucks per slider!  We had an app, two slider entrees and two beers each and the total was around 80 bucks w/o tip. If it wasn't for the beer I'd be coming out of there still hungry."
612,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Probably my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood right now! It's definitely not the most economical choice (the portions are tapas-style), but the food is fantastic. Although basically every item on the menu could be described as ""rich"" (chorizo, goat cheese / brie, pulled pork, shredded beef, fried sweet plantain), it's not super heavy, and the flavor balance is really finely tuned. I wanna come back to try all the items I was too full to get. Also the service was very speedy + staff are attentive! And decor is nice, with new furniture. Intimate but not cramped. Comfy experience overall."
613,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"If you read any bad reviews about this place, those people are haters or they're gentrifiers that don't know how to appreciate nice things. First off, the ambiance of this place is amazing. You walk into an airy establishment with wine lining one side and local art along the other side. The tables are strong and the servers are attentive. My girlfriend and I ordered two apps and food and it was all great. The yucca fries were perfect with the house sauce, the reina pepiada arepa yummmm and the mini cachapas were a nice surprise. Lastly the roques parrilla finished everything off so well. Amazing flavor and taste. We also caught happy hour and enjoyed rose. Will most certainly be coming back. Can't wait!"
614,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,This is an amazing little restaurant of Venezuelan food. It's very clean and shiny.  The decor is absolute amazing. When passed by it I had the urge to enter. So I went ahead and ordered an arepa. It is made out of corn and they filled up with blue cheese and beef although they tell me that its most common with white cheese (Queso Fresco). But you can basically fill it up with whatever you want. If you're hungry and want something made fast come to this place. I recommend it.
615,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,I go every week. The customer service is sooooo awesome! I've celebrated my bday there and I can't say enough nice things about this place! Try the sweet lab! It's amazing!
616,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"What an amazing experience. Venezuela is a country always have a special place in my heart. It's great to see Dominicana and Venezuela to bring to life a Venezuelan tapas style with so much beauty. Great decor taste, well done wine list and amazing flavors in the tapas. Customer service as amazing. Highly recommended."
617,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Amazing cozy place for the area. New and fresh environment for the neighborhood. Lovely concept, Fusion -Venezuelan,  and only wine and beer bar so far so good., with a tapas menu pretty yummy. The music is great, lighting, decoration and everything else it very comfortable. They're still working in the menu and some other stuff, as a new business requires time to really take off.  A little pricey for the area and what they offer but I Expect them to extend their menu and so much more. The staff is very friendly. I've heard they had the mini opening 2 weeks ago and it was bigger than what they expected, looking forward to look into the big picture, the bigger Party is coming soon. I will definitely give it a try, and come back."
618,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I just wanted to explain that they've decided that they've dropped their website in favor of their social media presence.  But they're still here!  Unusually quiet on a Friday happy hour, not sure why.  The same warm staff, and 'tortillas' made from grinding fresh sweet corn, etc.  The happy hour now has two of each of reds and whites instead of the full menu, but that's all you're gonna drink anyway."
619,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"this place just feels right - cheery atmosphere, the right music, wonderful staff very invested in their business.  The happy hour wine is wonderful: $6 a glass, almost a dozen selections you get to taste first, rotating every week.  The food is meant to be small plates to complement the wine - fairly well done and priced about right for a wine bar.  Unfortunately the namesake dish, arepas, are far overpriced and too small to put all the goodies in like we are used to down in the Village.  If they would cut a quarter off the price of the arepas all would be well with the world, even if these aren't the over-stuffed street fare we all know and love."
620,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Wine selection is excellent, service is wonderful. Their happy hour ($4 for beer, $6 for wine) is good and includes some tasty wines. We tried the yucca fries and the garlic tostones. Both were delicious. We'll definitely be back!"
621,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Came here a few weeks ago with close friends. We all had a great experience here. The food was delicious and the service was impeccable.
622,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"My bf and I found Barepas on Yelp yesterday and hit it up for some happy hour drafts and wine last night. The IPAs and Chardonnay were great. We ordered two plates of arepas - beef and brie and mango ceviche ....The arepas were really good! Bite size finger food. Perfect flavors, as well!  We got to speak with the owner/manager - Yensin - and preview their new brunch menu. We'll be going back!!!"
623,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Great place! The food truly brought great childhood memories. I love the Venezuelan food tapas. Highly recommended
624,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Love this new addition to the neighborhood! Came here for a date and the ambiance lent very well for a romantic evening.The staff are friendly, prompt and the food is fantastic! The ceviche was wonderful and I cannot rave enough about the Reina Pepiada Terrine which was the favorite tapas fish I ordered. Will definitely be back with friends very soon."
625,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I had heard great things about this place and finally decided to come in to try it out. As a Venezuelan, This place really nailed it in terms of flavors but also concept. The wine selection is incredible and the staff is really friendly and made really great suggestions in terms of food and wine for me and my mom when we came in. We had the tequeños, pabellón plate and 2 types of arepas. Everything was excellent! You MUST have the quesillo! It's so authentic, and honestly next to my grandmother's, it's the best quesillo I have ever had. And I've had a lot! Haha Also, great date spot if you're trying to do something different and new."
626,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Cute little spot we stumbled upon on a Saturday night. Recently opened and still gearing up their menu. The wait staff was friendly and helpful - Camille was a great waitress. The mini cachapas (fresh sweet corn tortilla with white cheese) was sweet and savory; a great pairing for a glass of wine.
627,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I just found this little gem  in Harlem. Cute place, nice jazzy atmosphere and great selection of wine. Good choice of Venezuelan traditional street food dishes but with a twist...a quaint place to discover...ohh they also have beer for beer lovers..."
628,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Fantastic food and fun staff that made us feel at home. Highly recommended for a casual evening out. And thanks Maria for our great happy hour pours!!
629,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"We love this place! We got in weekly since they've opened. It's women of color owned and run (chef & sommelier), and very focused on building community. They source many of their products from other local, family-owned businesses too. The food is delicious, the staff is friendly, and the wine selection is top notch.The menu is rather vegan-friendly, which is always a plus. The atmosphere and decorations are cozy and romantic while still being sophisticated and sleek. Best wine happy hour in the neighborhood with $6 glasses.Prices are a touch high for serving size and the area, and they're still working out their work flow. Overall, so grateful to have this spot in the neighborhood and excited for the many upcoming events (like wine dinners, theme nights, live music, and more) to come!"
630,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"The food is very fresh and vibrant, the ownership is so kind and attentive. This is a hidden gem and definitely a great neighborhood spot to come for a drink or some food but always both"
631,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Our new local favorite.  Wonderful staff and a great rotating selection of wines, beers and delicious Venezuelan arepas and tapas. Such a Great addition to the neighborhood!!!   Thank you Barepas and keep doing what you do!One bold suggestion:  1$ happy hour patacones ;)"
632,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Incredibly delicious food and wines. The most outstanding service we've had in ages. Have now been repeatedly and always consistent....will continue back many more times. Great live music too on weekends!!
633,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Clean, relaxing place (went on a Thurs and it did start to pick up around 8/9 but wasn't overly crowded), great music (they were playing 90s/early 00's R&B), LOVELY, KIND people who work there. Charming, neighborhood feel.Had the mango salad which was good, and these little corn ""pancakes"" with cheese in them (forgetting what they're called right now), which were nice as well.Great addition to the neighborhood."
634,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I love love their apricot salad! Their YUCCA fries OMGGGGG it is to die for! Everything here is great. everyone should come out and try everything on the menu from food to wine to beer. Tonight we had the privilege to try their flan and woooooooo buddy, wow, I don't usually like flan but this right here... it made me a believer!! Thank you and come out here ya, you don't want to miss out!"
635,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,This place is a new gem! Definitely coming back here for the amazing service and delicious food! The apricot salad is a MUST! Sunday happy hour is ALL DAY!
636,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Great date night spot and happy hour for those who love wine! Went here shortly after it opened and service and atmosphere was great but the food was so-so. Tostones were a bit chewy and tuna arepas were not working for me. I chalked it up to new restaurant growing pains. The next time I went the menu had changed and the food was much better. Their Roasted Garlic Patacones are my favorite and their sommelier is super friendly and helpful. If your focus is a great glass of wine and a light bite go here but I wouldn't go for just the food or a big meal.
637,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Amazing food and superb wine list. The food was out of this world, I went about a week after they opened and I can't wait to go back. Such a wonderful addition to the neighborhood I can't wait to be a regular !"
638,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I love Barepas so much. The first time my fiancé and I ate here we knew we wanted to host our engagement party here--and they threw us an amazing event! It's so much less expensive than any of the other options we considered, and everyone on staff was so committed to making sure we had a good time. Also, the food is amazing!!! The cachapas are my favorite but I'll eat anything on the menu"
639,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,This place is awesome! Great ambiance and they have a really good happy hour and great brunch specials. Food is delicious. Not necessarily traditional arepas but really delicious!
640,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I went for happy hour and dinner with a girlfriend on a Tuesday night and it was a wonderful experience. The happy hour wine list was short and focused, and the glass of Portuguese red that we each got was delicious. We ate the apricot salad, the yucca fries, the tostones with slaw, and the pork arepas. Everything was absolutely delicious and we couldn't have been happier. The service was so gracious, with both the host and our waiter doting upon us. The chef is from Venezuela so you can rely upon the authentic flavors and preparations. I will definitely be coming back.Oh also, it was quiet on a Tuesday night so we didn't have to shout over other drinkers to chat with each other. We loved the interior design, too - exposed brick, wooden tables, etc. Very tasteful and rustic."
641,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"A spectacular place with very nice atmosphere and above all very good service, exquisite tapas and a great selection of wines. without a doubt this place I recommend it to all my friends try it you will love it !!!"
642,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"My husband and I were excited to try this place out when we saw the sign go up! The interior is absolutely gorgeous, the ambience is wonderful and inviting! We got there pretty late in the evening so only tapas, salads and soup were being served. We decided to start off with their chicken soup! The soup's flavor is spot on but unfortunately it was not hot or warm, which was weird because it came in little mini pot, so I was expecting it to be hot. We also tried the surgical empanadas cachapas, which were excellent, and the patacón with chorizo! I wanted to love the dish so much but the patacón had a bitter/burnt taste to it which didn't go will with the rest of the elements. The most disappointing part of the evening was the side of Yuca fries we got, they were delicious but at 5 dollars for 4 fries, I can't justify ordering that again. The reasoning for leaving 4 stars and not 3 is because their service was great. The young man serving us was extremely friendly and attentive and I enjoyed the whole experience. Barepas is so new that I want to give them a few more tries, but they have tons of potential and I know they will do well!"
643,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,I live a few blocks from Barepas and happy to have this option in my neighborhood. I haven't tried the main dishes (yet) but the arepas are pretty good - good variety too. Can't remember my red wine choice but I remember ordering another glass. Staff was welcoming as well.
644,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Why isn't anyone talking about the ridiculous high prices of this place and the absurd food - price relation? Little arepas (made from corn with something else... plantains, pork, everything cheap!) that cost 14 and 21 dollars!!!!!! They charged us 21 dollars for an order of four little arepas because we accepted the offer of the waiter of adding an extra minuscule arepa (one and a half inches in size) to an order of three that already cost 14 dollars! What? Charging 50% more for 30% more food!? Dishonesty, there's no other word for that! We didn't accept the charge and they didn't charge us the 7 (7!) extra dollars. But they expected that to be ""normal"" or they just wanted to fool us. Go somewhere else to eat. We left the place upset and hungry and went to the classical Harlem Public to have a decent drink and a meal, although we wanted to try something new. If you want to try Venezuelan arepas, go to Caracas in the East Village or in Williamsburg, Brooklyn. If you want to eat in this part of Harlem go to Bono pizzeria, which is a nice and decent place in terms of food, price and ambiance. This Arepas is the mix of snob and Venezuelan bullshit."
645,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Ive been eyeing this place about a year since I saw they were working on it. I couldn't wait to stop by! And finally did since their opening about three weeks ago. Right now they are serving tapas until they get gas to prepare main courses. But let me tell you that was find with me! The atmosphere and the great service provided by Kimely and Sael made it worth while. I definitely recommend this place to anyone. I hope it succeeds. It is a great addition to the neighborhood. We had the chicken terriene, mini cachapas, yuca fries and ceviche. All amazing and super delicious!!"
646,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Delicious new little Venezuelan tapas place. Small but tasty menu, and a good by the glass wine and draft beer selection."
647,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Delicious and healthy tapas-style Venezuelan food. Definitely had some unique food I haven't tasted in ny before. Very attentive, friendly and knowledgeable staff.  Great happy hour prices until 8pm. Decor and music is modern without being overpowering or pretentious. Space is big enough and invites you to linger over beer or wine and tapas at the bar or at table seating."
648,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Food was really good but if you are hungry be prepared to have small portions. Ambient was nice with the live music band. I think it's a little overpriced.
649,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"We went to have dinner at Barepas with friends and had one of the best meals we've had all week. I've been to Barepas several times now and every time the food is fresh, tasty, and creative. The service is friendly and quick, and the wine list is exceptional. We live in the neighborhood and are so happy that Barepas is here."
650,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I've been here twice this week! The happy hour deals are great, and the staff is so nice. The menu is still limited since they just opened but good. Very small tapas style. I'm excited to see how this place grows!"
651,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I'm not sure why people rave about this place. It was way too expensive for fairly average food. The menu is much different in person than online (no octopus, no tuna tartar, no build your own empanadas). We ordered the apricot salad, which was actually mixed greens, not flavorful apricots, random peanuts, low quality goat cheese, and served with actual mustard. Not mustard salad dressing. Just mustard. The chicken arepas were just chicken salad on buns, also pretty mediocre and way too expensive. The pulled pork arepa was also pretty underwhelming. Our favorite thing was the fried yuca, but let's be honest, it's fried, so of course it's good. save your money and go somewhere else!"
652,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Very simple and delicious food in a well appointed space with great service.  Apricot salad is a delicious treat on a chilly fall night.
653,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Amazing.  Low-key, very stylish decor and comfortable neighborhood ambiance. Long bar, with fantastic beers and wines (the wine selection is wonderfully curated). Nice tables, great for friends night out as well as date night, or a casual solo stop after work.  The owner is such a great host. Now...let's talk food.  The Venezuelan arepas are hand made, with so many choices.  The pulled pork and braised beef are my favorites,  but really everything is delicious. Cannot recommend more highly. GO NOW.  What a great new neighborhood joint."
654,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Just got home from Barepas. As a Venezuelan American I was happy to find this fusion restaurant two blocks away from where I live. Was even happier to taste the flavors of home. We will be back. Gracias.
655,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I came here and sat at the bar one night and needless to say the service was lackluster.  They were inattentive and behaved as if they did not want to serve me.  I had to ask for utensils when my food arrived.  The women behind the counter did not ask me how my food was.  I believe they may have been family members helping out.  When my wine glass became empty they did not ask me if I wanted another round.  As I was getting ready to leave, the owner did not thank me for coming nor said good night.  He can clearly see that it was my first time at his establishment.  Not sure why there are so many glowing reviews.  I don't think I'll be coming back but if I do It'll be awhile until their service improves."
656,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This place is cute, the food was Delicious and the staff was nice. I really enjoyed it. The food was fresh, melting your mouth savory good, my friend ordered the ceviche and it was the best I've had in s long time. Highly recommend"
657,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"The best place to have a great time and best wine. The staffs are super friendly and knowledgeable about the wine. I highly recommend barepas. In addition, their products are gluten free and from the farm to the table"
658,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,Amazing Venezuelan food! Can't recommend it enough. We tried four tapas and they were all delicious. The drinks and the ambient were also good. Great addition to the neighborhood.
659,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This new restaurant and wine bar was a great find and addition to the neighborhood! The servers and chef are very warm and friendly, and the food was delicious and there's nice ambiance. Most meals seem to be tapas style so it's best to order a few and share!"
660,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Do NOT Sleep on Barepas. This family knows what they are doing. Thoughtfully prepared small plates where each ingredient receives the attention it deserves. The yucca fries are like pillowy croquettes enveloped in an addictively crunchy crust. The idea of an arepa as more of a concept and flavor vehicle transforms a greasy street fair food into an elevated and creative canvas for sweet plantains, red beets, blue cheese, and other non-traditional ingredients. Patacones are basically seasoned tostones with cheese and chorizo (at least the variation we tried). Whether or not you understood the last sentence you need to eat patacones at Barepas, and the arepas, and the flan (which had that homemade texture and thick caramel instead of some way too smooth, euro-style custard). I could not be more happy for our new neighbors. Best of luck and keep pushing yourselves! It's a breath of fresh air to experience the love and care that goes into your food."
661,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Great spot! Decor was beautiful, the tapas were VERY GOOD! Happy hour served wine and beer. Staff was very nice.  Quiet atmosphere so that you can talk. Nice crowd. Would go back!"
662,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"This is a wonderful restaurant and we had a splendid dining experience tonight.  Although it's a fairly new place, there were none of the usual slip-ups.  In fact, the only way you'd know it was new was because the waitperson explained that the menu was smaller than it would eventually become: two salads, one ceviche, and about four tapas-sized dishes, delightful combinations of rice, meat, chorizo, cheese, arepas (I guess). All consistently delicious.  We kept on ordering more (there were three of us) so the dialogue was ""Please bring us another order of those wondrous things stuffed with cheese, and the rice ball stuffed with meat. We also had ""surgical empanadas"" (I believe) -- I got the ""surgical"" right -- and they were do-it-yourself with tasty beef, chicken, bean-puree, etc. toppings.  The ingredients were first-rate and very fresh, from the sliced radishes in the salad to the delicate yet tasty dressings, and most of the food was gluten-free.  We devoured what we ordered.  The second part of this rave review is about the staff.  So nice, so eager to please, so warm and friendly.  One of us asked to send a compliment to the chef and she came out -- a lovely young woman of 24, who glowed.  At the end of the meal, we shook hands with the waitstaff, and I think if we'd stayed a minute longer, serious hugging would have ensued. It's a new place, but it's like being bathed in love and being fed tasty things all at once.  And I think that as word gets out, there will be lines out the door.  Hooray for these nice folks who make yummy food!"
663,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"I went here for date night and was thrilled that this spot has opened in my neighborhood. The decor was beautiful and the staff was warm, making us feel like we were right at home. The owner and the chef even greeted us at the end of our meal, which was delicious! We split three tapas from their appetizer menu, all of which were winners. The full menu is coming soon and I can't wait to check it out. This will definitely be a go-to place for us."
664,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"A great addition to the neighborhood!, Barepas exceeded my expectations. Beautiful design inside, a REAL wine bar that offers an extensive selection of beautiful wines to try by the glass (organic wine selection is A+), all hand selected by the wine director and owners. All the food I tasted was delicious, and the service was prompt and friendly. I wish them lots of success, they're off to a great start."
665,lVXassEQUuQbL2L6eMddDQ,"Let me start by saying, what a great addition to the neighborhood! I've worked in the neighborhood for the past 5+ years and there is nothing that compares to this place. I came across this place randomly; was walking down Amsterdam Ave and noticed their happy hour sign out front so I decided to give it a shot. This place is so clean that you can literally eat off of the floor. Staff is unbelievably friendly and will bend over backwards to make sure you are happy and your drinks are good and replenished. One thing I liked was that they don't automatically refill you without asking, they ask you first. FOOD IS UNREAL! Tapas style, I ordered the ""make your own"" empanadas and the Patacones with the fried cheese and spicy chorizo...this food will knock your socks off. The chef is AMAZING. Very minimal wait time for the food and everything is made fresh. There's actually a little window in the back that looks into the kitchen and you can see for yourself how fresh everything is made and prepared. Bathrooms are spotless. Great beers on tap and great wine selection. Beautiful place to unwind after a hard days work and have a nice drink with some delicious food. An employee ensured me that the menu will be expanding and that the Arepas are coming soon so this place is going to be even better than it is already! Highly recommend, will definitely be coming back!"
666,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Cea-Lo Cafe is a fantastic spot for Comfort Food and Soul Food. It's soooo hard to find a place that has authentic Soul Food nowadays, that isn't soaked in grease and salted to Hell. Cea-Lo's is in its on league.Cea-Lo Cafe was introduced to me by my parents. They were driving by one day and decided to give it a shot. I'm so glad they did because Cea-Lo's dinner specials will leave you feeling like Thanksgiving came early.I would definitely recommend calling your order in advance for pick-up--I don't think they deliver, unfortunately--(especially on a weekend) because everyone knows Cea-Lo Cafe is the place to get some mouth-watering Comfort Food and Soul Food.Place an order; I'm 99.70% you'll love it! (I say 99.70% because you can't please everybody. But only the weak hate Cea-Lo Cafe.)"
667,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This place changed for the worse. I'm not sure if there are new owners or new Chefs. The food is not what it used to be. Please do not waste your time getting the Mac & Cheese. I'm taking a star off for that. The prices are too high, minus another star. We wanted rotisserie chicken but they didn't have any so we were forced to get fried chicken. It was poorly seasoned & not good at all. Minus another star! I will give a star for the fried shrimp. I'll give another star the nicely newly renovated store. 2/5 stars is a 40%.  It's not worth driving 40 mins to the BX to support this small business. FYI this is my 1st time writing a review for this restaurant but it's not my first time having a bad experience.Cea-Lo! Some things are better left alone!"
668,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Mac & Cheese! Collard greens! Steamed cabbage! Grilled Salmon! Broiled shrimps! You might as well come & get a few plates of different dishes, you will be left wanting more."
669,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The quality of the food changed after they renovated. I was disappointed with the fried chicken and macaroni and cheese I got there recently. It was memorable not because it tasted great, but because it made me sick pretty soon after eating it. Disappointing..."
670,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This place appears to be very clean which is obviously great. So far I've had the fried shrimp, fried flounder,fried shrimp,fried chicken,mac and cheese, and collard greens. Everything was great where the stream shrimp kinda sucked. It was flavorless/bland. Overall, everything else was pretty good."
671,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Loved it ....I had Mac & cheese collard greens & fried shrimp it was 5 stars to me very well seasoned & delicious ...The cashier was very nice & friendly this is goin to be my new soul food spot
672,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Food is bomb 5 star, the MAC and Cheese fried fish and fried shrimp is great . I love their Lemonade and ice tea as well"
673,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Had food from here last week because my boyfriend raved about the quality. Unfortunately; the Mac and cheese was filled with so much grease that after a few bites I felt really sick to the point that I could not keep the food down. They need to remove some of the grease or maybe use a less oily cheese for the Mac. The hush puppies were good and so was their corn bread. I might never eat their Mac and cheese again.
674,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Excellent and better food! I had the wingette dinner!   Very tasty!! So tasty I ate it in the car! Will definitely be back for more!
675,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Great soul food. Unlike alot of soulfood spots all the staples are on point. The fried chicken & whiting Good!The greens Good!Mac&cheese Good!Cornbread Excellent!What sets them apart is the even have healthy versions: Broiled whiting Good!!!Strickly take out though. Small venue.
676,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"First time ordering from here, and I say it will be the absolute LAST! Soul food? Where? I ordered half a chicken with Mac & Cheese, and an order of 6 piece hot wings, and I must say that there was no soul food taste in it at ALL. Same 6 piece hot wings you can find at the Deli grocery on Southern Blvd and Freeman for $3.00. Same exact ones, don't believe me, see for yourself. Half of chicken was bland! Come one, where's the love? Better chicken at Popeyes! Mac & Cheese? Well, it was okay, but the place on Melrose ave is slightly better.  A waste of $18.00. Never again will I go to this place."
677,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"You want good soul food in the Bronx, you gotta hit Cea-Lo in Soundview. We got take out and we went hard. I recommend the fried shrimp, potato salad and baked macaroni & cheese. The menu is ENORMOUS so you gotta take time with it. My sister got shrimp and grits (the grits were BANGING). Just so you know, they only take cash. *DISCLAIMER* I will say this though...THEY DON'T HAVE HOT SAUCE. What soul food spot in the Bronx in 2017 doesn't have hot sauce? Yooooo. It went down like this...Me: Damn, this smells good. Where's the hot sauce?Cea-Lo: We don't have any. Me: Say what? NO HOT SAUCE? How a brotha gonna eat greens with no hot sauce? (Insert side eye)I still recommend Cea-Lo because the food is DAMN delicious."
678,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,The best soul food ever!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Mash potatoes cabbage Mac n cheese the potato salad I never know which one to choose so good everything they have... the guys are really nice in there as well if I can add more stars I would
679,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Loved it! I ordered the broiled shrimp and grits with an iced tea and sweet potatoe pie for desert.  My friend had fried whiting and shrimp with two sides of mac and collard greens. We both enjoyed our meals very much.  The only down is, I thought the menu was a bit pricey and the location is directly next door to a liquor store where there were a lot of men hanging in front of seemingly under the influence which made me a little uncomfortable as I had to walk by them to get to the restaurant."
680,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Ok so it's hit or miss here the steamed shrimp was disgusting my daughter who loves shrimp was so turned off by it that she has not been able to even look at shrimp since then. Also check your order before you go because I learned this the hard way more than once because it's so long of a wait you just want to get out of there... check it! Mac and cheese is delicious crab cake is also good although I also got a bad batch one day so like i said hit or miss. I will still go again because when it's a hit it's out of the park!
681,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Food is great but wait time is not and the menu online is unreadable so here is my favor to my fellow yelpers and here is a picture of the menu call in advance and enjoy!
682,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,This is a prime example of trying to support a black business and getting what u ask for....this place is 1)very unprofessional and ignorantly staffed 2)Acts like it's a pleasure for you to meet them and take your money and is  3)overpriced for undercooked food...very unpleasant experience....ate here once and it was disgusting gave it another shot and was further disappointed....I was better off going to White Castle around the corner basically smdh
683,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Make a long story short. Food is a bit bland. I had the fried shrimp with yams & macaroni . The yams & macaroni were both oily & sloppy. Taste like leftovers from the business day before. The shrimps were few but tolerable. Everything else including the rugged cornbread went in the trash outside their restaurant. This place either began to slack on the food quality recently or they were over hyped from the beginning. Harlem is my next stop for Soul Food!Cea-Lo ........ Never again. In nyc restaurants are required to display their dept of health grade........ From past yelp pics it look as if they were graded a ""B"" then went on to ""grade pending"". Now they have removed their health inspection notice altogether. Should I be worried?"
684,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,in the last weekThis food was horrible! No regular chicken wings ONLY wingetts. The wingetts were under COOKED I had to throw them in the oven when I got home; no seasoning just raw and rubbery! Mac & Cheese was mushy with little cheese and a sour taste; collard greens were bitter and tough. I ended up throwing the food in the garbage! On a lighter note the cornbread was good and the restaurant was very clean! I WILL NOT be going back!
685,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,It's pretty good. Second time me coming here. Last time I got the 3 pc whiting fish w mac and cheese and corn on the cob for $10. The fish was fish perfectly and tasted really fresh. The mac and cheese was really good as well. Really good taste. This time I got breaded chicken dinner w mash and corn on the cob. B A N G I N G!!!!!
686,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Amazing food, great vegetarian options! Everyone was super friendly, place was clean. Will definitely return"
687,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,I gave 2 stars because I wasn't satisfied with the packaging of the food. I ordered 2 dinners Catfish with colored greens and mac and cheese and Jumbo shrimp with sweet potatoes and corn. The dinner with the colored greens and catfish was placed in one packaging I was basically eating wet catfish from the colored green juices. Aside from that the food was ok. I really enjoyed the fish and the mac n cheese. I wasn't crazy over the colored greens and the sweet yams/potatoes probably gave me diabetes. I also ordered 2 lbs of Crab legs which was pretty good. The food is decent. I will try something else from there to see how it taste.
688,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This place was so pleasant, but is on its way down the drain if it doesn't conduct better background checks with their employees. The young lady who answers the phone ""Shay"" is unnecessarily rude and too ghetto to be dealing with customers over the phone. She should take a class in phone etiquette or something. ""Yea yo..."" truly is not how a respectable business employee should be addressing consumers. Food is great."
689,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Recommend this place.  Fried fish was on point, French fries yummy, not dried out.  Corn bread was moist and oh-so-good.  Will be trying the mac and cheese and strawberry cake we here so much about.  Oh and the fried shrimps.......finger licking good."
690,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Parking: Street parking available- or just double parkPrice: FairFavorite Food: Dinner Combo's Service: GoodFood: EXCELLENT!Best soul food spot in the Bronx! Def. recommend it to all.Their mac & cheese is on point!
691,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,I came here for the first time a few years ago and ever since then I'll take the necessary drive out of the way and then wait like 20 minutes for their fried or broiled shrimp. I believe the French fries are homemade and the mac and cheese is hit or miss. Most times the Mac and cheese tastes fresh out the oven but I can recall two times in which it tasted like it had a long day.
692,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"So at the beginning of the month,  on a Saturday evening,  at around 4pm I ordered food (called ahead) for the family (8 people),  I tried to get 2 whole BBQ chickens, with 3 large mashed yams, 3 large mac and cheese, 1 large collard greens (to try)and 3 orders hush puppies.  They told me that they could only give me 1 whole chicken. (I guess any large orders should be called in earlier, or maybe they just limit orders.)  Anyway, the young woman who took my order was very nice and told me that I could get everything else,  and that she could only give me 1 order of hush puppies.  However, when I came to pick up my order, she was able to get me 2 orders of hush puppies.The chicken was well seasoned and wasn't dry. The mac and cheese was very buttery- fattening and heavy,  but it was yummy.  The mashed yams were a little sweet, but well seasoned. Collard greens were OK, the family couldn't agree on a review of them. I feel collard greens are up to personal preference. For me, too bitter, but I'm not a fan of collard greens. The hush puppies were great, one order was perfectly cooked, the other was a little  burnt, but didn't taste burnt. The place is small & was packed when I picked up my food.  The staff was very nice to me.  It seems this is a family owned place.  It's a very small local business that does run out of food. I read earlier reviews of people being upset. But this is not uncommon with small businesses. I'd rather eat at a place that runs out of food, that way I know what they are serving is what was cooked for the day. Just call ahead to make sure you get what you want.  I'd also say, avoid the typical lunch and dinner times, or just call when they open for a 1 o'clock pick up. Then you're guaranteed to get your food with minimal wait time. :)"
693,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Hmmm... So mom suggested this for dinner last night 10/13 so the five of us drove there.  Wasn't too crowded so we decided on our eats and placed our order.  Ok orders were taken by name to keep it simple. Wait time was border line long..  Ordered for us jumbo shrimp and fries and fried fish wings and fries.  The abundance of fries served with each meal was terrifying.  I knew the fries would be horrible from the way they looked.  Mom asked about the corn bread and was told with every meal you would receive a slice of corn bread.  Of course when we received our food they stated that these wee not considered meals.  What are they?!?  For the wait and the education on what constitutes a meal or not the food was actually very good.    I suggest calling ahead to avoid the wait - took a menu with the number to use on our next feeding. They have eat in tables but the setting is very small and the ambiance from the PJs from across the street kept me on my toes so I can't really see anybody enjoying a meal here.  Cash is king here which also leads me to wonder why a restaurant in 2014 doesn't take credit cards debit cards or even EBT‼‼Good food in the end. I recommend this place.
694,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The food is good, and fresh. The sides aren't that great! I don't like that the green beans were over cooked. The customer needs help to, never call this place during lunch time."
695,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The food is good, and fresh. The side can is some work I don't like that the green beans were over cooked. The customer needs help to, never call this place during lunch time."
696,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,This is My third visit to Cea-Los . The food is great and the prices are affordable. I'm not a Big Potato salad fan but I always get it when I come here . The half half is always on point. And make sure you try the Mac and cheese.
697,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Bake Mac is good, the whiting fish was fresh and the wings was crispy and good but the collar greens was a lil off too me maybe next time it will be better"
698,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Needless to say trying to find good soul food in the Bronx can be a challenge.  I stumbled on Cea-lo via Yelp and let me say I'm glad I did. The service was awesome and the food even better.  I will definitely return to try some other dishes.  Good Job guys!
699,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Let's face it, there's a genuine dearth of decent soul food places in NY. Enter Cea-Lo. It truly reminds me of southern cooking. You can't go wrong. It was on my stop during a very rare trip to the Bronx. I especially remember the fried fish being quite tasty.It's a standard no-frills spot."
700,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The two times that I visited the establishment during my vacay I tried the 12 piece fried shrimp and fries. The fact that I ordered the same thing each time I went back is an indication that the food was good. To be quite honest, the shrimp was seasoned to perfection. Not to mention that they were also fried perfectly. My only complaints are that I wish that I could have had more shrimp and that my fries were a bit more crispier. As far as funds are concerned the price was definitely worth it... quite affordable if you ask me."
701,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"So I called cea lo for a take out order the person who answered the phone by the name of Shay was so rude and nasty. Instead of politely greeting me, she answered the phone with a bad attitude and it continued through the duration of the phone call. The food is great so that is the only reason I proceeded with my order. But the customer service was just horrible. It's like they just hire anyone off the street."
702,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"I love this place, their fried shrimps are the best I ever had, the cornbread is good too.  The other food is ok.  I alway look forward to going to Cealo.  I wish they had other locations, like in Westchester County.  The trip to Cealo is well worth the drive.  The food is affordable, and not to expensive for what you get."
703,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Excellent food for soul!!! Convenient take out restaurant in three Bronx. The evenings are crowded, come early."
704,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,I honestly don't know why this place has such low reviews. It has some of the best soul food you can find in New York. I have been to this place more times than I can count. The food is always fresh as you have to wait for it. It is always packed when we come. I think people maybe aren't ordering the correct things. We always get the whiting with shrimp mac and cheese and yams. It is so good. This is my stop for my soul food cravings. Yea the neighborhood isn't the best but that is where the best food is. I've never been disappointed with the fish or yams. Once the mac and cheese wasn't the same but came back again and it was on point. Cea-lo I wish you had more locations!
705,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The food is good to me. My favorite is shrimp with Candy Yams and Mac & Cheese. Now if I had to rate the atmosphere  I would give them 2 stars. The reason why I say tht is because the neighborhood guys are forever standing in front of the establishment rolling dice, playing loud music and trying to talk to every woman that  pulls up. It's disgusting. Now as far as the employees, the men are very kind and respectful but the women tht they have working there seem to always have an attitude and they always come across like you're interrupting their day. If the guys in f/o the place would hang out elsewhere and the females tht work there wld get a attitude check they   would get 5 stars because the food is really good."
706,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Small place but the food is ok.I had the mac & cheese and fried chicken. the mac and cheese was just ok, nothing really to scream about. The chicken was good though. I would be willing to come back and try something else, not the mac & cheese though."
707,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Always great food. They have catered food for my family and they are always a hit. The only cons are the location and the crowd minus, BUT it is great to see a black owned business surviving when so many don't. I can't take away a star for location...it is what it is. Cash and Carry. You're welcome!"
708,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Decent jamicain food can't front... Order out from here a couple times..The service is fast the least to say..But gotta watch for them rosedaleBoys cause they will catch u slipping by the can base lol
709,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"I was going to give this place one star even before I got my food. I was excited to Come here because I heard the place was really good. As I walked in, I saw the prices on the wall. The food here is way over priced. It's not in the best neighborhood but what shockingly high prices. I really wanted broiled shrimp and cornbread and that's what I was gonna have. So I made my order and 45 minutes later,  I got my food. I was pretty pissed off by then.  What a disgusting amount of time to wait for my food.      So I then tried my food. The shrimp was incredible. Maybe the best shrimp I've ever had. The cornbread was way to tiny. The size was kind of insulting, but oh my God was it good. It was moist and perfect. I'd Come here again but I'd probably call ahead and I'd prepare myself of the high prices."
710,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"It's located in the North but this is the place to get that good  ole original southern soul food at its best. Just like MOMMA make it. Service friendly order taker with the care of the customer securing that the customer has what he/ she desires before leaving.. Come on in and get s delicious meal or get it catering service,"
711,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Love hate relationship with this place. Most of the time the food is good. They do have quite a few bad days.
712,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This place is starting to become a hit or miss when it comes to flavor.. Yesterday I had fried chicken Mac n cheese and yams, and same sides and fried shrimp. The chicken was fried perfectly with no flavor/ seasoning at all..  I was quite dissatisfied.. The fried shrimp was pretty tasty....the sides was just ok.....No corn bread in any of the orders, and the half and had was a large cup of ice... For the cost it definitely isn't worth it any longer..."
713,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This is one of my favorite spots in the Bronx.  Everything I've tried tastes like magic.  My favorites are the whiting, shrimp, yams and mac'n'cheese.  Get their iced tea, too, while you're at it."
714,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,We have has Cealo before and the food taste alright last night we both had fried shrimp and we got food poison. This is my first time getting food poison and it is not fun. Both my husband and I have been sick since eating this last night. I know I wasn't expecting fresh or the best quality but I didn't expect feeling like the devil is inside of my stomach (dramatic I know) but I will never return here ever!
715,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Great the food is delicious. That great southern sunday dinner your mother grandmother cooks. I'm addicted to this place. the only bad part is that they don't deliver. It gets crowded but they're pretty quick
716,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"A few of my coworkers and I ordered take out food from this restaurant. The order was made over the phone and picked up later. The order was placed and double checked for errors.When we arrived to pick up the orders, they did not have an item (mozzarella sticks) and did not bother telling us until we got there. There goes one upset coworker. They forgot a few items so we had to wait a little while for them to gather the missing items.The good thing was the food smelled great and we got free iced tea/ lemonade.When we arrived back to our job and distributed the food, everyone that got a fish or shrimp item has no tar tar sauce, and no marinara sauce. Luckily,  I had hot wings, mac and cheese and potato salad.The food tasted good, in my opinion, but I've had better experiences with take out food."
717,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Best soul food ever. Staff is always friendly and courteous. Be sure and ask for the half and half drink of half iced tea half lemonade. Also that's the only place I found the great sweet potato pies
718,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"New York City's Soulfood secret. Nuff said. The greasy, well seasoned, tasty ol'school soulfood ya gran-ma made; oh yeah, with a big butter soft slice of corn bread on tha side. Good stuff."
719,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"My boyfriend and i took a cab to try this place out cause it was close by and it had mixed reviews on yelp. I had the fried jumbo shrimps, Mac n cheese, collard greens and potato salad. Good points: Mac n cheese was greasy but buttery, cheesy, moist fatty yumminess lol. The potato salad is very good added a lil salt and pepper and was good to go.Reality hit when: i tasted the shrimp which were oily, the breading was dry and cracking to pieces and tasted as if it was fried in week old oil as the color was deep brown... Yuck! The greens were bland yet they tasted like it was boiled in hotdog/ mop water.Now my bf had fried chicken, yellow rice, coleslaw. His chicken looked beautiful but tasted like cardboard, rice tasted like Goya box rice and I liked the average coleslaw that came with his meal, bc he hates all coleslaw lol ... Not sure how I feel about them ... Might give them another shot might not"
720,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"I decided to try this place because I had heard a lot of good things about it. The lemonade was good, although definitely not homemade. If you like sweet cornbread, then you may like the cornbread here although I thought it was a little too moist. The salmon cakes were tasty, but a little salty. The catfish did not have enough seasoning, but the fried shrimp was absolutely delicious, if not overpriced for the amount that you get. The macaroni and cheese was good, but not great. The only thing I had that I absolutely did not like was the collard greens. Way too sweet. Overall, the reason why I'm giving this place only two stars is because you really just don't get what you pay for."
721,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Only place that sells chicken and waffles around here and I love it even tho chicken wings aren't my favorite cut of chicken. It is all u could ask for in the dish semi soft sweet waffle pairing up perfectly with great fried chicken. The Mac and cheese isn't the best but there isn't anything like it around sound view. Ill continue to go back just just for that
722,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This so called soul food was disgusting the rice taste like it was cooked In dish washing liquid. The mac and cheese taste like perfume was in it, the best thing was the half n half neva again"
723,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,It use to be great. Now the food is just rushed and watered down. Mind u it's already too expensive for the portions they give. They use to have great yams. Now there just canned garbage and they try to say it the same thing. Just about done with them. With the fuckin baby portions of cornbread.
724,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Recently went to the Harlem location. One word: Horrible! I waited one hour for a basic salmon steamed fish order. Never in my life. The employees were rude and did not communicate that the cook lost the ticket. After making a complaint and asking for an apology, they offered one. The workers that are handling the register need a class in customer service. I won't be going back. Don't waste your time!"
725,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"If you want some simple delicious soul food without any of the unnecessary pomp and pretense, this if your place. None of that overly trendy ""trying too hard"" bull this is simply good food , just like you'd get in grandma's kitchen."
726,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,This food is the bomb! I keep a menu on deck as I coming from Manhattan from work   I call ahead so hubbie can pick it up so I can eat immediately. One of few spots in the  Bronx that still exists for soul food real soul food! Took my dad there an ole country boy from NC he enjoyed so much he rode his bike back a week later to get Sunday dinner.
727,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,Omg did I just find a soul food jewel in the Bronx?!!! Food was awesome! As I was ordering I couldn't decide which side to pick. The guy at the counter kindly gave me a sample of all the sides! I went with the Mac & cheese and strings beans w/ fried shrimp. My food was great! They're not super expensive and not cheap. But the price is worth it for fresh food. I will definitely return!
728,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"By Far When the restaurant opened up several years ago, the food was amazing , the employees took there time with making the dishes.  However, over time the food gets worse and worse there are not making any effort in taking there time preparing  the food.  I stopped by today , I was not even greeted by the counter person , she looked very upset like usual, In any case she slapped her pad on the table with pen in her hand and said "" What You Ordering"" I ordered the Greens, Mac & Cheese and baked chicken, during my wait, there was a gentlemen in the corner with his movies laid out on the table trying to push movies on me.  Then there was a crowd of young individuals that came in yellling and screaming, MGMT did not do a thing I could'nt wait to leave, The Waitress/ order taker said "" Your Order Is Ready""  told me with a diminshed look on her face, She really need customer service classes.  I paid the money, and hurried out of there .  Once i saw my food the mac & Cheese was as if the eggs was scrambled on top of the Mac & Cheese, and the cheese was very clumped together.  But the worse was the greens it seems as though they are so tired of cutting them up, they were as if they were whole not cut up at all , and they were very GRITTY.  the chicken the worse!!!! Im so disappointed with how this restaurant in the south bronx that once stood out, is falling tasteless."
729,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,The food was was awesome! i had the beef ribs potato salad and  collard greens. i ate it and got to the last piece and spoonful and got upset that i didnt have anymore lol ive had alot of the other dishes and they were just as good. best soul food in the BX. I def recommend you stop by and experience this food orgasm :)
730,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"All I have to say is, my complements to the chef. Came for the first time last night and I can honestly say that it will not be my last! The food is seasoned and cooked to perfection. 5 stars no question!"
731,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"The food is very good, but it is extremely overpriced. They are convenient for small catering jobs"
732,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,The food is good BUT *** the attitude the lady has who take your order is DISGUSTING
733,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"Food was HORRIBLE!!!! Yams were from the can,overly breaded chicken with no flavor...corn bread was dry. Mac n cheese tasted like nothing. Shrimp was edible (unlike everything else) rice and beans was OK..but I wouldn't order it again...all in all I can say whoever but positive reviews were either paid to do so or never tasted authentic southern food. I would highly suggest ppl to oversee this area and go to Amy Ruth's in Harlem. Since I have to rate a star for this place yo warn ppl not to go I put the lowest possible rating ever!!!"
734,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,ive been eating from here for years... this is by far the best soul food in the bronx!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! the fried shrimp the best ive had period. the potato salad is yummy.... everything is yummy...love love love cea-los
735,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"This is absolutely my favorite soul food place.  Whether its chicken or seafood, it's delicious.  All orders are made fresh, so the wait is usually 10-15mins, but boy is the wait worth it.  My favorite dish is the Broiled Shrimp & Flounder with a side of Yams.  Earth-shattering good.  Beats any seafood dish on City Island.  This is a family-owned restaurant that delivers on food quality and service.  I'll be a life-long customer.  Thanks Ceo-Lo."
736,Z-8pLenKRMwAftAWDNZA2w,"SOO GOOD! This place has really good food... tastes homemade, no artificial taste. I've had the rotisserie chicken, buffalo wings (hot!), mac & cheese, potato salad, string beans, and corn bread. EVERYTHING I had was good except the buffalo wings which was too hot (although the guy assured me it wasn't). I didn't give this place 5 stars because they do act a little ghetto, the wait time is too long, and there isn't enough room to accomodate all the waiting customers. I'd say check it out if you're in the area- or not. It's worth it!"
737,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"My new favorite hotpot. I live in the middle of Flushing but go out of my way for this hot pot. My favorite thing is that it's a real buffet so if I only want 1 fish roe fishball or 1 fried tofu skin, I don't have to commit to an entire order. The most interesting thing about this place is that they slice the meat to order. Not sure if it actually adds anything, but it is interesting. And yes, the beef, lamb and pork are included in the price.They have desserts & drinks included as well, but honestly it's not the greatest, but I'm not too bothered because I'm usually too full anyways."
738,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Came to check out this hot pot place after seeing it multiple times.We came around 7pm and noticed that it wasn't busy at all. The inside is clean and well lit. This All You Can Eat (AYCE) hot pot features a good selection of food - vegetables, seafood, meat, fruits, desserts, and sauces.I ordered the House Famous Spicy Pot, which is their spiciest soup base. As a person who loves to eat spicy food, I definitely enjoyed the spice level. However, one thing that I did not like was the amount of oil in the soup. It was very oily, almost felt a little bit too much.Considering that it wasn't busy, I felt that the service was average. There was nothing special and felt it was typical to that of an AYCE restaurant.The price per person is $26, which I would argue as somewhat fair for an AYCE dinner. However, I was disappointed in seeing a mandatory 15% service fee charged to the bill, which did not include tips.Would I come here again? Maybe, if I was desperate enough for hotpot in College Point. Otherwise, head to Flushing for better options."
739,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Disappointing Inside was nice, clean and spacious.  The food was neatly displayed.  They need to fix their soup base.  I could t even taste food because the soup was like too oily and food cooked in the soup pick up the oil.  In my mouth all I taste was oil.  I scooped out the oil and it filled up three sauce bowls for the oil.  They also charge 15$ service fee on top of food and tax.  I don't know what they are.  You should tip separately.  So you will pay food, tax, 15% fees and Tips.  They never mentioned when making a reservation."
740,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,It's not a bad place for all you can eat. They have a lot of options with seafood. It's similar to spring hot pot but spring has a lot of veggies. This place has a big selection of seafood has little desserts on the side. Fun place to come hang with friends. It was a bit hot their for hot pot. Ac was not turned high enough.
741,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Usually, I'm not a fan of any hot pots. Just because you can definitely get more bang for your buck at home. Especially seafood galore. If anyone knows who I am. I go all out when I do hot pot with friends for a fraction of the price! But, there will be days you don't want to do the work! I actually enjoyed this place a lot! Variety is great! From vegs, noodles, and balls. As for the meats you have to hit up the counter and the guy will cut it for you. Drinks are on the corner by the entrance FYI. They have soda, water, and even milk tea. In case you may not find it. We ended up ordering thinking they're weren't inclusive to the AYCE. But, it's by the dessert table area. Definitely spacious. So great for parties or small groups!"
742,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"When your gfs rave about a place and then head over to eat there 3x within 8 days you know this place has to be good. Coming in I wasn't expecting an actual buffet setup . It seemed massive, the space as well as the buffet. The veggies aren't as wide a variety as you would get from spring but there is so much to choose from. And meat is included in the ayce price of $26 pp before 3. And desserts which range from a few meh looking cakes, peanut milk , white fungus and goji berry tang Sui, fruit, raindrop cake and they have a cotton candy maker on site. Drinks are also included, they offer hot tea, milk tea, lemon water and also sell beer and wine as well. We all got the tomato soup and the trick is to also dump some more fresh tomatoes in so when the sauce thickens the flavor really kicks in. The seafood does not look fresh sitting out there like that, I wish they offered more vegetables; In terms of leafy greens, they had tonghua, spinach, big white cabbage, watercress. The meats were a lot fresher than other ayce places I've been to. Servers were friendly. Place wasn't so crowded when we Went on a Saturday around 2pm and it was so comfortable and inviting with TVs all over playing different shows we stayed around 2 hours . I can't wait to be back this is THE AYCE hotpot place"
743,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"I'm so happy this place opened. It's probably my favorite hotpot joint compared to the millions that I've tried. Food - 5/5 it's fresh and there's a lot of variety:  veggies; meat; noodles and other different carbs; a ton of different fish balls; seafood; soups; fruits; dessert. Self serve drinks (coffee, tea, lemon water, and soda). They cut the raw meat in front of you. Super fresh!Seating - 5/5 ample seating and can accommodate big groups (6 to a table). Couches have compartments to put your belongings.Service - 5/5 very attentiveBathrooms - 4/5. I really like the sink being placed outside of the bathroom concept. Parking - 4/5 parking lot fills up quick so you'll need to find street parking. They validate your parking, so be sure to keep your ticket and tell them."
744,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"A friend recommended this place to me months ago and in the last few months I finally got to try this place. This review is based on mutiple visits here, as a couple and with my family as a group.My very first visit I was greeted very warmly by the hostess and I literally asked her a ton of questions just to get to know the place better. She was very patient, friendly, and frankly very personable. I wasn't sure what kind of experience I was going to have at first due to reading other reviews prior, but perhaps it was misunderstandings caused by the language gap. This woman actually took the time out to teach me how the cotton candy machine worked as she was stationed for that as well. No issues there.This is an AYCE chinese style hotpot buffet place that includes beverages, fruits, and desserts. Fruits: honeydew, cantaloupe, pineapple, and oranges. Desserts: They outsource it to a  bakery and keeps the stock in the fridges. They offer mini cakes, cookies and butterfly pastries. Theres freshly made cotton candy, in 4 colors: pink, blue, white and light purple; Limited one per person.But newly added raindrop cake that's like jello and soon they'll be adding ice creams according to the staff. Beverages: fountain sodas (Coke, sprite, orange soda, diet coke and ginger ale ), hot tea, lemon water. But there's more if you want to order from behind the service counter.The vast selection of options was astounding and they have more than 16 sauce options for your mixing pleasures. There are 5 private VIP rooms, each one named after one of the boroughs of NY. The general seating consists of booths for 4 or 6 people but they do have individual chair seating options too. But the booth chairs has a secret compartment for you to place your belongings and jackets, so it won't smellblike hotpot later.The meat selection consists of beef, chicken, pork, and lamb. You have to wait by the window as it's made to order on the spot and you can ask for extra thin slice for those that prefer that. The guy behind the meat slicer is pretty awesome too, basically like any other place, after they see you as a regular, they're all like friends after a bit. I had a staff eat his lunch with me at the table after my family left me earlier and he accompanied me so I wouldn't eat hotpot alone. (To me that was touching lol) Highlights:  This is an AYCE and for the price, you really get your money's worth. But they do have stuff you can order a la cart if you want something of a better quality and off the general buffet table selection. I've never had trouble getting seats here as a party of 2 or a group of 5 people. My favorite so far would be their new chilled raindrop cake,  jello like dessert thing that's also known as the szechuan cold skin. After its made they have to cool it for 2 to 3 hours before they can serve it. I was glad I got to try it before it got cleaned out tonight. (A must try!)Pro:Free wifi and 2hrs free validated parkingIf you bring your ID on your birthday, they will treat you to dinner. And for those that wants a discount, pay your bill in cash and they will offer you 10% off.Con/Pet peeves:Short staffed for the huge restaurant size, not as attentive but luckily mostly self service here. And their bathroom has no diaper changing stations for those with babies. The desserts can get a little dry after its left out for too long, but if you catch it when they're replacing plates; it's actually pretty tasty."
745,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"This is now my favorite all you can eat hotpot restaurant. I'll tell you why. Parking convenience - There's parking available in their lot and when you get your ticket stamped after you pay, the first 2 hours are free. Minimal Wait time - They have lots of booths and similar to The Buffet upstairs there are plenty of seats, so you likely don't have to wait to be seated. Especially since not too many people know about this spot (for now at least) it wasn't crowded at all during peak lunch hours. Low price - Came on a Monday afternoon and the price was $77 for 3 adults after tax and the 15% service charge. Fresh Ingredients - There are lots of veggies and they are so fresh. There are also meats such as lamb, pork, chicken and beef that is sliced to order at their window. There are also clams, squid, fish and shrimp available for their seafood selections at no additional cost and all looked really fresh as well. Buffet style - You go up and get your own food. No more worrying about ordering that extra fishball and receiving too much when all you wanted was 1. You can go get a single leaf of spinach and multiple plates of beef if thats how you like it. Drinks - All drinks are around $1.50 for soda or $2.50 for herbal tea or beer. But no problem if you want fountain soda or water, you can fill up at no additional cost. Clean - Food area and seating area is spotless. I thought iCook was clean but this place does not appear to be an AYCE place by looking at how well its kept. They also have compartments that open up on your seat for jacket and bag storage.Sauces - abundance of sauce selections. Hot oil, minced garlic, scallions, peanut sauce and the oh so popular hotpot bbq sauce.Broth - There are so many selections, they have more than any other places I've been to. Herbal, pork bone, tomato w/ corn and pork bone, Curry, the list goes on.I really like this place and will definitely be back with the whole family. Everyone gets their own pot, so don't worry about anyone stealing your food.IG : Danyoizme"
746,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Came here around 7pm on Monday and surprisingly it was pretty big but wasn't busy. It was like 4 tables of customers and 15 tables empty. Had a bit concern about the quality of the food if it was sitting there for too long. The price was around 30 something after tax and tips that included meat, seafood and drinks. As mentioned by many, if you pay cash, you will receive a discount. The price was fair for this kind of buffet. They will give you 2 hours to eat but if you drive, this is a reminder they only offer 2 hours free parking. I don't believe you want to pay extra for parking. There wasn't much of services since everything was done by yourself from picking up the drinks to carrying your own food to the table. The server would bring you the soup base and from time to time, they will take the plates away. That was pretty much it. The drinks was included which was a plus. Overall it is a pretty solid hot pot place with varieties of selection. Food:Pro: Don't have to ask anyone for more of certain kind of food. There were appetizers, dessert and drinks which were all included. Free birthday meal. Con: plates were too small, which I went back and forth so many time to gather enough food. The thinly slice fatty beef is essential in any hotpot but it was not good here. Beef was tough even through it was freshly sliced. If you here for the beef, definitely don't come here expecting it would be great."
747,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"$26 AT DINNER for all you can eat fresh cut meats, seafood, veggies, meat balls, carbs, dessert, soda, tea... did i mention it's individual pots (for your germaphobes)? AND there's free parking downstairs (just make sure you get stamped).I love the fact that its not located in Downtown Flushing, it's tucked away in the shopping complex in College Point. Very well decorated place. IF YOU LIKE SPICY, GO FOR THE SPICY BROTH. SO GOOD.One star was taken away because they close relatively early. They were closing at 10PM on a Friday night. But i was told that's because they're new in business and hours will change once business picks up.I will be back.!"
748,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Hot pot is always a love and hate relationship with me since I love it when I first start and hate it when I'm at the end. This place is AYCE and is really clean and is located within the Hotel Dupoint. So if you are staying there it makes for a fantastic spot. If you want protein such as beef,chicken, lamb or pork you have to order it from a window with a service bell and they will cut it in front of you. Also if you are looking to have rice with your hot pot you need to ask a waiter/waitress. Besides that everything you can grab by yourself at the different stations they have. They also have a decent amount of broths to choice from which can make for a new flavor every time you go. There also is a parking lot and they will stamp it for a free 2 hours if you do park inside. Overall a very good AYCE hotpot location that is not located on busy Main Street. Food - 9/10Cleanliness - 9/10Staff - 9/10"
749,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Came for dinner around 6pm on a Friday and there was plenty of seating. I have mixed feelings about hot pot buffet style because.. how much fish ball, meat, mushrooms and noodles can you really eat? Also, the fish ball station here is HUGE. Great variety and plenty to choose from that you would normally get at hot pot. It came out to about $30+ for dinner per person and I'm not sure if it was worth it in my opinion. Maybe because I don't normally eat that much at hot pot and because it's a buffet style I felt like I have to force myself to eat more. Parking is convenient because there's a huge lot that gives you 2 hours free as long as it's stamped before you leave the restaurant."
750,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"I had a great dinner experience here. The restaurant is beautiful and well-kept. The people are very friendly and provided excellent and fast service for us. There are a ton of food and drink options to choose from (the milk tea especially was a favorite of ours). If you want a great and delicious hot pot experience in Flushing, look no further than here!"
751,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"The servers have pleasant manners in welcoming mood. This was my first ever to try Hot Pot, and it was great. Plus, there were lots of veggie option, that I like the most."
752,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"points for having good food selections and spacious seating..sake and beer is very decently priced as well. But the really need to step up with their soup base, just bland and superficial spice, not much taste at all."
753,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Went there with family and many friends on Saturday for the AYCE hot pot dinner to celebrate the approaching Lunar New Year. Valet packing is available. The space is gorgeous and clean. Waiters and waitresses are attentive to refill the soup and collect the empty dishes all the time.You may find as many materials for the hot pot, from the meat (mutton, beef, and pork) , sea foods (fish fillet, shrimps, blue crabs, and octopus), all kinds of Tofu, noodles, to assorted vegies. I appreciate that they even serving the egg dumplings, pork blood and pork kidney here. For kids who don't enjoy the hot pot, they can take the routine buffet which frankly was not that good and with limited choices. Pricing was reasonable, as a dinner hot pot was $26 plus, and $15 per kid who did not order the hot pot. But be aware there was a obligatory 15% service fee.Overall, it's an above average hot pot place to go."
754,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"The food was amazingggg! The soup base was very rich in flavor. The sauce bar had everything. The vegetables, seafood and meat are all really fresh. New AYCE spot hotpot place and I loveeee it."
755,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"I'm not a big fan of Hot Pot Buffet! My wife suggested it and we ended up going as a party of 8 ppl. The place did have a wide variety of food items, a lot more than I expected for the price($26). The staff was a little slow and there wasn't much dessert, but overall a good experience."
756,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Very delicious with affordable cost!  I hope they have fresh chilies. Coz not spicy enough ...
757,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,I highly recommended this restaurant! You will never regret for trying! I will come here twice time for each month with my family. My husband love the pieces of beef so much. The food is so fresh and various！
758,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Not many people know about this place since it is located on the 2nd floor in the hotel building.There are a lot of hot pot places in Flushing, but I would say this is the best if you are looking for fresh food and UNLIMITED meat (lamb/beef/pork) for a decent price.The place is very clean and new. I've been there about 3-4 times already and food has always been fresh. Only thing I wish is - to have more selections for sauce, drink, and noodle.Tips**They have a big parking lot but it's valet.**Make sure you get the stamp at the counter for the valet parking.**You can store your jacket and bag under the seat.**You cannot change your soup base later.**Good for both a small and big group."
759,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Food variety is ok, fatty beef a little to ""Fatty"". Cups always have bleach smell.i always wash with ""hot water"" they provided."
760,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Have gone to many hot pots and this is above average. Overall their food selection was good and selection was plentiful. The parking can be difficult and the parking staff is not so friendly as they seem to be overwhelmed. The buffet was a good value and selection of fresh cut meat were good. He place is very clean as it is a new place and staff was friendly. They also offer many different soup base which was good. I had the extra spicy miso and it was delicious.
761,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"This place is inside Hotel DuPoint, two levels below The Buffet. The restaurant used to be al-la-carte, but reopened to be all-you-can-eat. When I entered, the host happens to be talking on the phone. After a few minutes, the server brought me to the table.I saw that there are ten soup bases to choose from, and premium al-la-carte items to choose from. I chose the little lamb soup base, which was spicy. There are four counters, one for meats, one for appetizers and vegetables, one for seafood and miscellaneous meats and vegetables, and one for desserts. This is different from other hot-pot places I went to, where you don't get dessert and appetizers.The place has TVs showing Spectrum News. There is Chinese music playing in the background. There are five party rooms that are named by the five boroughs of New York. When I entered, there were several parties already there. I ordered the usual items.I saw that they don't have ice cream, but sago in coconut milk, cupcakes, cookies, and cakes. The price also includes drinks, which consists of soda, plum juice, fruit punch, and peach tea. On the receipt, it also includes the service charge."
762,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"We went for kids birthday party yesterday. That is no host at the front table. When I found a lady to ask for the information, her face like we owe her money. After we ask for VIP room, and she told us minimum order $300. After we get into the room, we wait for 10 minutes nobody tell us what should we take our drinks. My friend brought her kids and get the drinks by herself, she dunno where is the glass so just take what she saw. One of the lady yelling at her and take the glass directly from her hand without any notice. What a such waitress we met!!! I feel so sad for the owner, they really had no service at all and this restaurant is the worst service I had. We will never come back anymore. But our waiter is good to treat us. Just the ladies we don't want to see their face anymore. the service is very important in US, especially New York because you charge the tips or we need to pay the tips. We come to celebrate kids HAPPY birthday not pay money for suffering."
763,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"This place is one of my mom's favorite.  I'm really so-so with this place.  Besides the soup base and getting the check, there's really no service.  This place is an All You Can Eat.  The cashier is super nice.  Not only she's the cashier she is also the cotton candy maker.  LOLI went to this place four times, overall they are okay.  A great place of you can eat a lot."
764,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"First time eating Hotpot in pinshang. Very nice, spacious environment. Every thing is fresh and neatly displayed. The four of us shared a lot and Enjoyed our time here very much. We will probably go for a spicier level next time, a bit mild."
765,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"For the price of $18.88 (when I went for lunch on Friday). The price is really hard to beat for hot pot buffet, with basic meats included (lamb, beef, pork, chicken). Everything else is buffet style, grab it on your plate and bring it back to own table. Location: usually no problem finding space in parking lot. 2 hours is free, don't forget to bring in parking ticket and get stamped! Restaurant: space is pretty big. Interesting decor and vibe. Somewhat modern with its simple design, industrial with the exposed brick and black ceiling, but also somewhat vintage with the George Washington or Marilyn Monroe on the back of chairs. There's a sauce station for diy dipping sauces. A order station for the meats. Buffet style areas for food to serve yourself. Food experience/price: we (hubby and I) got seated in a 4 people booth. Coats can be stored underneath the booth seats! Convenient and genius! Felt spacious for two of us for seating but we quickly filled up the table top with food, and that's just food for us two! Can't imagine with 4 people! Each get own personal pot. Chose pork bone broth and haidilao spicy hot pot (which he later regret because it's too spicy after eating everything with it!) Great way to eat lots in a healthy way! I found myself eating majority seafood and vegetables actually. Can only eat so much meat, especially since the beef can be quite fatty even if it's sliced super thin. I do like that they have some hot food as well like fried rice, fried chicken, garlic bread which is nice. Desserts can be better, they were just mini sized puffs and cake pieces. Drinks costs extra but there is water, lemon mixed drink, and tea for free (near the front of restaurant). Overall I think I might go back if I'm craving hot pot, it'll do the job but for the price I'd rather find a local Asian restaurant to eat cooked dishes. Hot pot gets tiring after eating a lot of it."
766,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,This is good! Not only delicious but also fresh whenever I come! Don't forget to ask for a parking ticket if you need
767,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,1. Came here on Friday and got haggled by the valet parking in the front. Won't let me park my own car and said the lot is full. They then parked the car and when receiving the car they wont give you your keys until you give them tip. Then they have the nerve to have me walk to my car. 2. Went to the floor and Hot Pot was closed. They was exterminating with heavy chemicals. Saw 2 people with face respirator on and told us to leave immediately.
768,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"One of the better all you can eat hotpot. Good varieties of meat, seafood, fish balls, veggies and noodles.  Fountain soda is also included, but they do have can and bottle drinks for a price.  The only complaints are the crabs didn't taste fresh and the meat slicer didn't speak English. I asked a couple of times for pork and even pointed at the picture, he kept waving his hand.  But when my friend asked in mandarin, she was able to get it.  There is a 5% discount if you pay cash, remember to ask. And 2 hours parking free."
769,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,This place would've been a great bargain if the workers there were not rude and nasty. I went there a total of 3xs. 1st time is was okay except for the waiter who didn't bother to tell us that we had to get our own tea/water. I understand we don't need to tip but seriously i had to walk back 4xs to get water for my table. 2nd time we had to ask a few times to get the soup spoons and mind you it was my husband and I but the waiter only brought over 1. Does that make any sense? 3rd time soup base tasted so bland we hardly ate the food at all. I truly wished I had good things to say but I definitely would not be coming back.
770,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Thank you for your attentive service and kindness, Ah Long! The food is also so good and we got a table right away too. Definitely will be back again. Thank you for having such a wonderful staff!"
771,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Food and service was outstanding. The servers were very attentive and made sure our hot pot soup was filled. They have a large selection of food choice and everything is clean and fresh!
772,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Pretty good bang for your buck. $21 per person including tax and tip. Lots of veggie and meat options. Soda, coffee, tea, and lemonade all included. Dessert options very limited and not very good."
773,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Lunch $18 (tips included) per person, excellent food quality and wonderful service. Definitely will be back!!"
774,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Hands down the best value buffet in town. All you can eat. This is not the bs ""ask and you shall get"" kind of buffet. You actually get your own food! Recommend the spicy and little sheep soup base. You cannot find another spot like this. The cooked food section plus the drinks section are the hidden gem in town. Think it easily bests 99 favor taste in terms of value, variety andflavor"

776,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"The best hot pot buffet I've come across. Wide variety of food selection. Sauce station has a lot of options. The fatty beef and lamb are sliced to order. The soup base was nothing special, but I don't usually expect much as hot pot buffets. Convenient that there is a parking lot. Free to park for two hours if you're eating there, so watch your time!"
777,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Not a bad place for hot pot! They do AYCE and the place is very spacious. One thing that can be annoying is that you have to go up to the counter every time to get a place of meat. They will cut it for you right there but it's one plate per person at one time so you'll probably have to go a few times during your meal lol but all the veggies and such are buffet style. They have a soda fountain and other cooked foods as well!
778,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,I gotta say for the price of $26pp ($32 after tip and tax) this place is a pretty good all you can eat hot pot buffet. I think the best part that separates it from the rest is the unlimited seafood and meat. I mean the slices are pretty thin but you can go up and order as many as you want. They also have the basic noodles and fish balls you see in other hot pot places.
779,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"I was so gonna give five star until the end of my birthday meal (not sure if they offer any birthday special)My friends and I came here to celebrate my birthday because a article on Wechat (something like Twitter) introduce this place with highly recommendation such as: 200+ choice of food and all you can eat (which was exaggerate since I only saw about 100~120 choices of food). They also offering $2 off discount if you dine in during the promo period.Everything was OK. They offer about 10 different kinds of soup base for each person so we were very exciting about what to get and started to discuss which one we want and we want different soup since all  of us wanted to share with each other. The server came and said: you will need to check on the menu instead just talk about which one you want. (that's about 3 minutes after he passed us the menu and there were only 5 table out of 40 tables are occupied) okay fine we check the soup base and started getting some appetizer and sauces. My boyfriend picked some pork katsu which is nasty. It's cold and chewy, definitely not the normal taste of any fried food. Ok its fine since we did not come here because of  the cooked food. we started getting our meat which I like it a lot. They cut the meat in front of you and demand that only one plate allowed at a time which is totally understandable. I didn't try the fatty beef so I am not going to make comment but the lamb was tasty to me (one of my friend mentioned the meat has that special lamb smell in it  but  I did not experienced myself) Everything went great, soup base was so-so, pretty basic. A note that I want to mention and appreciate is they have two types of soup for refill. One pork bone one mushroom which I found is very considerate and thoughtful for vegetarian since I never heard any hot pot restaurant refill veggie  soup, they usually pour pork soup and make most vegetarian difficult to enjoy hot pot.Back to the reason I only give two star. when all of us are finished (which we didn't follow the two hour dining limit so I do feel bad about it) and ask for check, we bring up the $2 coupon (as I mention above it's from a Chinese twitter). the server said: Each of you will have to share the article under your account in order to receive the benefit. It wasn't mention that everyone has to share  the article but ok we can do that. However my boyfriend don't have wechat and server insist all four of us have to share so we just  have to wait for my boyfriend to download the app and set up everything. It took some time because he didn't have data and the wifi in that area wasn't that great. When we are waiting, a server came up and ask for pay and we said we are waiting for the downloading and he said oh then you need to pay with cash in order to redeem that coupon. And after he walked away, another server came up and emphasize that we can only use that coupon when we paying in cash with rude attitude. You didn't not mention a WORD in the article that you have to pay with cash so you can use the coupon AT ALL. And we don't really carry cash all that much nowadays of course we didn't expect that due to the fact that article didn't mention that rule. IF YOU MENTION THIS IN THE ARTICLE I WILL BE HAPPILY ACCEPT IT AND JUST  PAY CASH, THIS IS A TYPE OF DECEIVING. We have to keep waiting for app to be set up and figure out  how to puzzle the payment in cash and, TAKING THE SERVERS' ATTITUDE. Thats right I use plural because there were EXTERMEY RUDE servers came and complain which wifi we using why it takes so long, and ANOTHER SERVER CAME AND KEEP SAYING YOU HAVE TO PAY CASH TO REDEEM THE COUPON AND WE ASK WHY YOU DIDN'T PUT THIS ON ARTICLE SO WE DON'T HAVE TO SPEND SO MUCH TIME AND HE JUST ROLL HIS EYES LIKE HE IS PASSING OUT. At end we just paid in cash and redeem the coupon  because the sep up taking forever. Also I think the server didn't want to wait anymore. My boyfriend didn't set up the app and they didn't bother to check. I went to the owners and complain about the nasty attitude due to their careless act. They listened sincerely and apologize for it and ask who were the servers.I won't go back until a year or so because I know  they will not stay alive with this   kind of  service no matter how good the food is. Flushing is very competitive, one small mistake will crush you. Food still good so I give two star, very fresh and their drink were decent."
780,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"very good！nice and clean there's food there service is very good too, everybody who work there are very friendly to us!"
781,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,This is the best hot pot in new york city. Fancy renovation large and clear. Lots of choice that you always can find your favor. The spicy one i tried is so amazing.!
782,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,This is the best hot pot restaurant ever. The soup is top notch. Everything is so clean. I love it.
783,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"This is a very decent all you can eat hotpot place. A lot of selections, and very fresh. I did not give a higher rating, because their service needs much improvement."
784,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Good service and the selection of food is decent. Lunch is $18.88 plus tax and service fee, which is added to your check. No additional tip is expected and there is no option to tip extra - unless if you pay by cash to the staff."
785,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Worst place ever!!! I went there wit my husband and two kids so we ordered 4 soup base. After 15 minuets we were told that the kids have to share soup wit us if not they will be the same price as adults. I was like wtf!! First of all nobody mention anything about it when we first walked in and now we already start eating u tell me the kids r $25 each??!!! After we talked to the manager the still didn't try to fix it. They rather pour away the soup than let us keeping it. On top of all this there were flies everywhere and they tried to zap them while we were eating. After we paid the bill(gratuity was included) they gave us coupons worth $2!! Wtf is $2?!! That's an insult. Even if u pay me I still won't go back to this f*cking place
786,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"For $31 per person, the price is not bad for all you can eat hot pot.  The meat is not bad.  BUT, the customer service is horrible.... it's close to impossible to get someone to grab a ladle or to refill the soup pot.  I literally need to walk around to find someone to help me.  The amount of MSG in the soup is also ridiculous.  Im now 20 hrs after the meal and I still feel thirsty.  Can't go back."
787,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Honestly kind of disappointed. The workers here are kinda rude. Also the food looks like it's been sitting there for a while so I don't know how ""fresh"" it really is."
788,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Customer service is very poorly handled. The price for for my 5 year old was $15.99 and we requested a pot for her and they said she can't because the price is only for Sharing of a pot so we said just give her plain hot water. Another issue we have is someone in our group is allergic to one of the ingredient in the soup based which the menu didn't state contained it so we asked to change the soup. They placed the order not telling us that if we touch the soup base it is a charge of of another full prices of $26.99 to change the pot. So when we find out we said forget it they first refused and said we can't because the order was placed already, we argued and said no just give us plain water for the pot and cancel the order.Total ripe off to charge an extra $26 just to change soup! After some argument they come back and not charged us the extra. I really wish they handled the issue better, it is A shame since I really did like the place as an alternative to go to spring in flushing.The coupon we received the previous week we went was such a joke. We thought was one card $2 off per person for everybody, but instead it was just $2 off and for all to get it everybody have to have a coupon."
789,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Wow, all-you-can-eat for only $26!!! The food was really good and the restaurant was modern and clean. Good staff and they were very helpful."
790,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"Ok,they opened again. I gave a try today based on the previous comments about their food but what was out of my expectation was their rude service. First, the owner thought they would have too many people on the first day of their reopening day. So when we arrived, they asked us (two) to wait outside for a table unless we were willing to share with others. We told them that we would come in and take a look. What surprised us was there were only 1/3 of table that were in use. Most were empty. Plus, they didn't have tables for two people. They were either for four or for six. The waiter took us around to look for tables and ended putting us on a six people table. We were told to only use part of the table and share with some other guests who never showed up. What I meant is all group of two use other six people tables. No need to share at all.Second, we ordered a soup that wasn't suppose to be spicy. When we asked the waitress to change the soup, we were told because we have tried the soup, they can't replace it and we will be charged extra for changing the soup. What on earth could this make sense in a buffet hotpot restaurant. Even the meat is expensive than the soup. Lastly, they rudely force people to pay amount of tips in the check. If you can't accept this, go to other hotpot restaurant. There are many good ones out there."
791,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"We like the interior decoration, we like the cleanliness, we like the variety of food items, we like the freshness of the food, we like the soup base options. It was priced within average. Will go again!!!"
792,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"spacious, FRESH crab,  less than $30 all you can eat, free parking. The hotpot soup was just mediocre though."
793,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Soup base is not bad. Place is big.  Soda is far away.  I like it.  Hope they have more seafood. But for $26 for dinner AYCE. It's not bad
794,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,For the price. Food are good. The vegetables and meat are all fresh. Definitely will come back again.
795,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"We went there on Wednesday afternoon for lunch, the first day of the restaurant's reopening as a hot pot buffet.  The lunch hot pot buffet was $18 per person and dinner buffet was $26 person with time limit of 2 hours.  Parking is free for 2 hours as well.  Drinks were included in the price and were self-served near the entrance of the restaurant.  Besides unlimited soft drinks and water, milk teas and sour plum drinks were also available in the small fridge near the fountain machine.  The restaurant was super clean and spacious.  The soup base options were well designed.  There were two long stands set up for hot pot foods which we went out of our table to get the foods we wanted to put in our hot pots.  There were also a few tables set up for the hot pot sauces as well.  We had a good time in the hot pot buffet.  The only suggestion we had for the restaurant was we hoped they could bring us the soup base faster.  We waited about 10 minutes before they finally bring us the soup base.  Thank goodness they offered self-served side dishes and drinks, otherwise we would be starved to death.  So one star off for that issue.  Overall, the experience was nice and we would definitely want to come again to enjoy the hot pots."
796,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,Great hot pot! All you can eat with fresh meat and seafood! Well worth the time. Parking is free with validated ticket. Staff were the best all around! Will be back!
797,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"We have been to this place many many times. But today while we were eating, the restaurant was renovating. Contractor start painting the whole bathroom door and wall with clear coat. Which smell so bad. We complained to the front desk but after 10 minutes they start painting again. Very smelly paint. We will not come here again."
798,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,One of my favorite AYCE hotpot place. Easy parking. Friendly ambience. Clean and new. Highly recommended
799,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"For $26 including unlimited meat and seafood the value here is pretty good. There's a decent variety of options and everything was delicious. The staff was super friendly, and when they found out that it was our first time at a hot pot restaurant they were super helpful and attentive explaining all the options and the waitress even mixed up a couple of sauce combinations she recommended we try. I will definitely be back here!"
800,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"I came here with my wife thanksgiving dinner  the food is a lot choices,place is nice prices better than you go to regular restaurant we very enjoy it, I will go more often with my friend"
801,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"This place was extremely good. The customer service was great and they had a variety of foods that you can choose from. Overall a really nice place, I would come again."
802,sZ-Y_NgZQOvNS70V1IYjSA,"not bad for lunch but dislike that fact they included 15% ""Service charge"" on their bill, when i asked if that's tips and they said no. then WTH is ""service charge""??? i just paid whatever on bill."
803,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great place! Fast casual By far one of the best burger spots in the Bronx. I ordered the ""El barrio"" burger and it was amazing and fresh. The service was great. They were very kind and welcoming. All the food was fresh and cooked quicklyAlso the Half and Half drink was amazing! Definitely recommend!"
804,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This is def one of my fav places to grab a burger, and I live in Harlem, which goes to show you it is worth the commute.  Milk Burger is a great fast-casual spot, with a pleasant staff, and serves of fresh & delicious food.  The Milk-a-Bello is my favorite which is a cheeseburger with a portobello burger, lettuce, tomato, onions, and MilkSauce. They also offer adult beverage such as spiked lemonade and a great craft beer selection.  The space is always clean and features artwork from local artists."
805,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I recently wanted to order wings for happy hour which goes until 7 pm. I usually just call ahead of time and then walk over and pick up my order. I called at about 6:47 and was told over the phone that they weren't willing to give me the happy hour deal by phone and I'd need to come in person for it.I was about to walk over but just asked like ok, if I reach by like 7:05 at the latest would it be okay? And he was like ""well it's happy hour and that would be past the time"".  I just felt it was all a bit pedantic. I mean it was also confusing as a concept because I did call well before 7 pm... like for example, if there's a lunch special that runs from 11 am-3:30 pm, I would expect that if I called at 3:15, I ""made the cut"" as I'm clearly placing the order well before the final time. Well, it seems like this establishment clearly values saving $2-3 over making a customer happy but the associate did just speak to me matter of factly and not in a rude tone, which I did appreciate at least. I'll probably forget about it and just go back in some time because I do love their cheese fries for $4.95... I just feel the burgers are overly priced especially for being in the Bronx and also because the size of the burger is average (similar size as Shake Shack), but the price point is higher."
806,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I love the taste of the BX Goat Burger (I believe I added bacon to it). It was juicy, and the arugula added an extra edge to it. The fries were good as well; I believe I had the Cajun ones.I'm not sure though if it's worth it in terms of the price... it comes out to around $16 for the meal. I think it could have been around $12. Maybe if they offered a meal deal or combo instead of having to pay for everything separately? In terms of portion size, the burger was not small but not huge either. I would prefer to go to Five Napkin burger and get a huge burger for $14 ish and then get free fries with the yelp check in.Overall though, still a great place and it's good to have options in the Mott Haven area!"
807,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,The food is good but their pricing is embarrassing. 10 for one tiny little burger? No way.
808,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Great price! Their falafel burger is amazing! Can be bigger but I'm also greedy so. Cocktail prices are good. Great neighborhood spot. Wonderful service.
809,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I gotta say, they have a good burger but it's definitely overpriced. Especially for the area. 13 bucks for a burger is a little out of line. Add fries and a drink you're well over 20. Guess that explains why they're never that busy. Anyway I work in the area and I will go back for sure, but Il have to really be in the mood for a burger to do so. If they made their prices more comparable to other burger places, like say Shake Shack I would go a lot more."
810,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Great service at Milk Burger. Upon entry my husband and I were greeted with a warm welcome. I had the fish burger which was really delicious with the cheese fries. Everything tasted fresh and the food was served nice and hot. I would definitely recommended Milk Burger for a great burger spot with fast service.
811,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I've been going to Milk Burger for about a year now and every time I go I am never disappointed. I adore their turkey burgers... it literally the best turkey burger I've had in my life and thats saying a lit for someone who had to substitute for beef burgers for 10+ years. The only disappointment I ever had was when they would run out of turkey but the Chicken sandwich and Fish Burger are also good alternatives. The atmosphere is also very inviting and the staff are always attentive and courteous. You always feel like a friend when you enter the space. Also, they have this new milkshake that has Cafe Patrón in it ( i forgot the name) but do yourself a favor and try it! The flavor is amazing and they don't skimp on the alcohol. In all, I love Milk Burger and wish them continued success.Sidebar/Shameless Plug: Shout out to my friend and ex-boss Ronald Draper who is the creator of the ""LOVE"" artwork that you see on the wall in the restaurant .

812,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I wish I could give a better review.. I've been a fan of milk burger since they were in East Harlem and Eric was involved. I'm not sure if he's still involved in the milk burger brand but unfortunately, the burgers are nothing like they used to be. This is my second visit to the Bronx location since they've opened. The burgers seem smaller, they're not as fresh and well prepared as they used to be.. the prices have always been pretty high but at least the burgers used to be good enough to be worth splurging on every so often. I also wish I had an old photo of the guac burger to compare to this new, sadder version. There's barely any guac to justify the price I'm paying.The milk sauce now tastes way too much like mustard. Idk what else to say, I'm really trying to be helpful. Milk burger used to be my favorite burger spot in the city."
813,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,I would recommend this place. I wanted to go to Manhattan and get a burger and shake but there was too much traffic. Looke online and decided to give this place a try. Burger and shake was worth it. The nutella shake so yummy. Will go back again.
814,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,I would recommend this place.. I wanted to go to Manhattan and get a burger and shake but there was too much traffic. Looked on Yelp and decided to give this place a try. Burger and shake was worth it. The nutella shake so yummy. Will go back again.
815,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Dudes. This spot is amazing. Wish I had to walk past it more often. Friend and I went for an early meal. My friend had the Portobello burger. I had a lettuce wrapped BX Goat Burger. Awesome on both ends. Truffle fries were not that good. Sorta greasy but passable. They also offer alcohol. We had something with Hennessy in it, it was ridiculous. As in holy Jesus that was so good it should be called ridiculous. I wanted to do a shake but was so happy with my meal I didn't want to ruin it."
816,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"The burgers here are DELICIOUS! Only gave 4 vs 5 stars because I feel they are a bit overpriced and in the Bronx, but that doesn't stop me from returning! The girl at the cashier is always super friendly, great customer service. Their fries are also good, regular fries, cheese fries and their sweet potato fries. Their mojitos are on point, currently they are updating their liquor license but when they do have alcohol, I would recommend trying them"
817,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Such a cozy spot that holds no more than 15 people max. The burgers taste fresh and the variety on the menu is great. They have a great selection of beer too. Cozy bench style seating for a small group of 6. Love this place!!!!
818,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,One of the best burgers Ive had in a while! I had the guacaburger with sweet potato fries and a vanilla milkshake. The guac is freshly made and you can certainly taste that! The milkshake was tasty and thick.
819,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I like the Burger with the portobello mushroom. I usually get it with no Onions because I hate raw onions. Sometimes I get fries. The space is beautiful and they worked very hard to create something nice for the people of the area. East Harlem's loss was the south Bronx's gain.Disclaimer: Erik, the owner of Milk Burger, has been my friend for years and I count him as a brother. Maybe this means that I am easier on him, but I am sure he would agree, I would never give him any review he didn't deserve, good or bad."
820,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I WILL return!!!! My fish sandwich the bomb!!!! I was looking for my tarter sauce n started eating and realized I didn't even need it. The Mint lemonade was AMAZING along with my ENORMOUS onion rings! Everything was hot and fresh, packaged with care! I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!"
821,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Randomly saw this place while driving home from work, the outside was very inviting and I can never past up a good burger so I decided to give it a try. I am glad I did. The place is really small but once inside the environment is very comfortable. The people working are nice and you get a very clear view of the people who are making your burger which is a nice touch. As far as the food itself I got a burger with bacon and their special sauce. The burger itself was very close to shake shack which I consider the best burger as far as taste. It was seasoned very well and cooked just how I asked. The cheese fries were a disappointment though. They use the cheap melted cheese sort of like those given by the corner store delis when you get cheese fries. Overall I was not disappointed with this place. Would highly recommend."
822,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Came here looking for a ground turkey burger with sweet potato fries and hunni I got just that! It was amaze balls to say the least. Clean environment, knowledgeable cashier and perfect fast food joint. All they need is s banging happy hour and folks will be knocking the door down to get in.. Did I mention the incredible playlist they had spinning.. Not this rap stuff u can't understand but a whole lotta soul and flavor just like their burgers"
823,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,My favorite burger bar!small restaurant with nice drink and awesome food.High traffic road and hard to find parking!
824,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I had always driven by here and wanted to try it and I'm glad I did! I order a cheeseburger, fries and a black and white milkshake and was not disappointed. The burger was fresh and cooked to my liking, fries were great (not greasy), and the black and white milkshake was divine! It's a quiet place, good to grab a quick, delicious bite. I'll definitely be back."
825,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I had been eyeing Milk Burger since before it opened; I remember when I was in Mott Haven last year I saw signs for it coming soon and was instantly intrigued. Since today was my day off and I had time to kill I decided to stop here for lunch. First off, I really need to applaud this company for opening their first location outside Manhattan right here in the Bronx. With all the Manhattan hot spots seeping into Brooklyn and Queens, it's nice to see my borough getting some love first. The space isn't large at all, but they make good use of it by having stools along the windows and counters, as well as tables strategically placed throughout to maximize space. Decor is mainly woods, think along the lines of Shake Shack.The menu is typical of most other fast foodish burger places, but I did find that Milk Burger had a larger selection of types of burgers and fries. I decided to go with a regular Milk Burger (single patty - you can order a double) with a side of fries. I decided to have it with everything - lettuce, tomato, cheese, onion, pickles, and Milk sauce. The burger was good - full of flavor, not too sloppy, and the perfect size. Note that the Milk sauce is mustard based, so if you're not a mustard fan go without or ask for it on the side.  The fries were good but pretty run of the mill. I picked up some sweet potato fries to go and those were better - they had a nice spice to them which made them stand out. You can order online to pick up if you'd like, and they have a rewards program too - though just walking in and ordering I only waited like 5 to 7 minutes at the most. If you are staying to eat, the staff will serve your food to you - a nice perk. I'm happy I finally got to experience Milk Burger - definitely a welcome addition to the Bronx."
826,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Amazing burgers love the set up went right before closing nice for something quick workers was very nice
827,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This place is a bit moreon the pricier side for lunch. I was looking for something new. And I found it at Milk Burger. I don't quite get the nameof the restaurant and it's relation to the title. But the food was tasty and cooked to order. I can appreciate the freshness and flavor. However, for lunch.....I don't want to spend$20. The other good part is the accessability of an alcoholic beverage. I was happy to have an over priced margarita for lunch! I have tried the double stack burger, milk sauce, the fish Sandwich  and fries.  But thebest part was the fish Sandwich."
828,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,This place. And the BX Goat Burger. Do yourself a favor and make the trek here. So good!!
829,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Bummer. I love this burger. Been supporting this homegrown place since they opened in East Harlem. But why does it cost now $21 for a singleburger and a shake?
830,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I was so sad the east harlem location closed. Their burgers are so good. We ordered a double swiss mushroom burger with sweet potato fries. Super juicy, quality burger that just hits the spot. The sweet potato fries have truffle oil- so delicious. It a pretty reasonable price for the portion and new york."
831,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I had gotten the fish sandwich made with tilapia fish and a side of sweet potato fries and it was great! My only complaint was that it was a bit expensive for a fish sandwich and the fries portion was small for the price, but I would def go again to treat myself!"
832,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Happened upon this place while on a walk with my roommates. Quality food (burgers well cooked) and well made drinks in a calming atmosphere.Music was top 40s  and vibe was relaxed- perfect for an after work bite & a drink. I ordered the guacaburger & spicy fries. Spicy fries were very well seasoned! Docked one star because we didn't feel very welcomed upon entry, but one of the employees was very friendly throughout."
833,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Milk burger is a hidden gem in The Bronx.Best burgers I've had in a long time. The customer service is amazing everyone is beyond friendly I love coming here!!!
834,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"First things First........ $25.00 for A Double Cheeseburger, fries and Strawberry Shake!!!!!!!!!! N0 WAY in the World!!!! Especially N0T @A your standard burger joint! This is Bruckner BLVD N0T The Hamptons!!!! At that price I fully expect to be blown over by A Massive Burger that's going to leave me Stuffed, instead of an undersized burger that left me wanting MORE!!!!The fries and burger were brought to the table nice and hot, directly off the grill. Fries were well salted and fresh tasting. The Shake was THICK and Tasty with fresh piece's of strawberries,  very satisfying and the burger was your average burger, nothing exceptional. Location is everything and in that area with all the road work being done and no where to park it's difficult to patronize the place, another draw back. I've been meaning to try them out for A while and today(Friday afternoon) I did, but rest assure it was A One & DONE!!! The dinning area is well kept and furnished with wooden tables, chairs and benches, not the biggest place, but there was Plenty of room and I can see why, at those price$$$$$, it was Empty! I know why their name is what it is, cause they will MILK you of All your Money!!!!"
835,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I been excited to come and check Milk Burger, is over my speciation, I really recommend it, come and check it out...I got jalapeño burger, was great perfect seasoning balance on the flavor and great service...."
836,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,This is now my favorite non-chain burger joint.My boyfriend & I visited this place as a quick lunch stop. I got a cheeseburger/fries/strawberry lemonade and he ordered a siracha burger/cheesefries/halfandhalf lemonade. Everything was very fresh and tasted very good! The lemonade was the best strawberry lemonade I ever had. A little pricey but at least they accept debit/credit
837,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This hole-in-the-wall place is a Hidden Gem. Parking is very difficult but worth the stop. The menus predominant burgers, local supporters of Bronx Brewery beers to wash down your burgers. They do offer milkshakes, but who wants a milkshake when you have beer... Okay you have kids. Get the milkshake if you have kids with you. Lunch time can be pretty hectic because of the construction workers, but there's a heavy rotation of them coming in and out.Hi Porter the Portobello mushroom cheeseburger and sweet potato fries. My wife ordered a turkey burger with cheese. Fries were little salty for my liking but very flavorful. Both patties seasoned very well with minced onions. Some burgers come with an offering of a double Patty. Average meal price for burger and fries it's $10."
838,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I finally went to check out this new Burger joint around the area, my part of the Bronx is deprived of good restaurants so of course I needed to see what this place was about. Very nice looking place, Eric the owner is such a great guy he came over and talked with us for a little while, he really made our day. I had the Portobello mushroom burger, have one with a Bronx brew  Suggestions: my only criticism is the lack of vegetarian options, would love to see a black bean or potatoes burger on the menu."
839,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"We came 10 minutes before closing time but they didn't tell us until they were taking our order.. The sign on the door said ""open"". But they were nice to still serve us and the burgers.. Were amazing! I got the classic milk burger and my boyfriend got the jalapeno burger. They are on the smaller side though. Beware: sweet potato fries were horrendous. It tasted as if they over did it with cajun, so disappointing. Overall will be coming back for some mo'"
840,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,This place is insane. Burgers are amazing. Good selection - both classics and creative stuff.
841,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This place looks very nice, clean, and workers are nice as wellFoodBURGERS OVER PRICE 12 + for one a bit bigger then a slider FRIES ARE NO difference then your locol chines FRIES should be better for the price.WINGS Wtf 8.00 and you have to pay for the source, wings were nasty cheap quality, I would have say the worst I have ever had.Dont get this unless you need a reminder of your drunk college freshmen days. They were so terrible that a cant put it in words to describe themCan soda  2.  Ok if you get a cup with icePelegrino water 7 once 3.75For the burger is a  five on a scale of 1/10,  FRIES should come with the burger bc it over price and its cheap frozen friesBurger were a little bigger then a sliderThis was me second time and I was hopeing to find a reason to love itTwo of us burger fries two soda , side wing and pelegrino $46 dollars in the SOUTH BRONXI WOULD NOT BE RETURNING BC THE QUALITY OF FOOD AND PRICE Service got my food one one came to see if every thing was fine"
842,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Favorite burger spot in the south Bronx.   Somewhat like a smash burger.    Totally worth the stop !   They serve booze as well
843,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Just experienced the famous Milk Burger on Bruckner in the Bronx w/the family. The service was great. our waitress Kimberly (i think) was kind enough to join two seater tables so that our party of 4 could sit together. The cooks were really nice too. They were nice enough to give us extra milk sauce and extra pickles when asked. No problem.Now about the burgers, straight to the point...if you are not a fan of mustard, just ask for the Milk sauce on the side. That's all the Milk sauce is...a mustard based sauce. We ordered 1 Milk burger, I Milk-o-Bello burger (the milk burger w/added portobello mushrooms), 1 fish burger and 1 turkey burger, fries and cheese fries, oreo shake, ice teas and mint lemonades.I was satisfied. This beats McDonalds or Burger King any day but since I am not a huge burger  or meat person I would probably not be the best judge here. I'm more of a seafood person (I wanted to run across the street to El Botecito for ceviche lol after). I just had to try this place out since it was in my hood lol. It was not bad. I'd go again If I was in the area.The only two downsides IMO were that the temperature was very cold inside. Today was a very cold day and the heat inside would have made the experience better and also...we were not asked how we wanted our burgers. So if you prefer your burger cooked a certain way definitely ask for it. The place was nicely decorated, clean dining area and clean and pleasant bathroom. 4/5 :)"
844,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Overall not impressed. Milk Burger was meh, fries were soggy, and side salad was wilted and pretty gross. Also noticed that the prices are higher in the Bronx Milk Burger. What's that all about?!?!Heard about this spot in the New York Time's article naming the South Bronx the 51st (of 52) places to visit in 2017. A Bronx-native currently living in the South Bronx I was curious to check it out. Left unsatisfied, and will probably never go back."
845,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great burger spot, reasonable prices amazing food beer on tap milk shakes amazing atmosphere what else do you want"
846,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Super friendly service and a nice little hole in the wall right next to one of the field sites. Amazing burgers with great flavor combos. The goat burger was my favorite. Highly recommend grabbing a bite here. Prices are reasonable and the burger are decent sized. If you're looking for a filling lunch that isn't super greasy but big on taste, give them a shot. Also, some really good beers on tap; lagers and ipas, but pretty great none the less."
847,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,The burgers are really good. I had the guacamole burger with sweet potato fries with a frozen lemonade which was delicious. They cook right on the spot no back room so you can see how they make it. Its small but cozy very chill place. Definitely a hidden gem in the Bronx. It's a lil pricey was 25 just for what I got. But other than this it's yummy.
848,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Went for a portobello burger and truffle fries. The burgers were good but way too small and expensive for a burger using a supermarket bun in the Bronx. Additionally the truffle fries tasted almost identical to regular French fries and I didn't feel they were worth the extra cash. I like this place but I wont be returning unless the burgers get bigger/better or more affordable. I felt like the burgers at this place resemble sliders more than they do real burgers. My fiancé and I bought 2 portobello burgers, an order of truffle fries to share, one mint lemonade and a  bottle of water and the bill came out to 35 dollars which is insanity for what is being offered here."
849,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Portobello burger is delicious!!! The best sweet potato fries that I've ever had in my life. The margarita is strong but is not overpowering. Fresh lime juice. Will definitely come back here again!!
850,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Excellent mojito. And cheese burger. A+ customer service.. I am so happy to have a place like this in the South Bronx.
851,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Their vegan burger (portabelo mushroom burger) is sooooo delish even my picky kids like it. I would buy it every day if it wasn't so pricey $10.50 just for the burger nothing else with it. There onion rings are good as well as there sweet potatoes fries. I hope they lower the price or at least add a drink and fries with it. Besides that the place is very clean service is awesome.
852,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Best burger place in the bronx.Going there since it open. Recommend that everybody eat there.
853,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Very nice. I had the Sriracha Burger , double patty with onion rings, medium rare. I was very satisfied. Burger was delicious, onion rings were tasty, the eating are was clean, and the employees were polite and professional.  They have a small soft drink menu and also serve Bronx Brewery in cans, Bronx Brewery is a few blocks away. I think the patties are 4oz, so I'd recommend going with the double patty."
854,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,This is my favorite burger spot in the Bronx. My coworkers and I eat here almost every week! The staff is very friendly and the food is great. So far my favs are the milk burger and the GuacaBurger. The fish burger also tastes good (definitely fresh and flavorful)....... and for my alcohol lovers.... wait for it..... they even have mixed drinks and beers!! So if you're ever looking for a good burger definitely stop by. Your stomach will thank you.
855,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Stopped by on a whim.  These burgers and fries are awesome! I think the prices are a little expensive for industrial neighborhood hood it's in though but a better quality meal than shake shack which is also expensive.
856,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Milk burger is delicious. The burgers are handcrafted and made to order. Call in your order ahead of time and it will be ready in 10 minutes. Freshness makes a huge difference when it comes to burgers. Milk burger uses fresh ingredients and has a variety of burger types even veggie options! The turkey burger is the biggest burger if your hungry. Patties are not huge. Better than Shake Shack!!!!!!!!
857,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This restaurant is in the middle of ""nowhere."" Ended up here randomly after a gig in the Bronx.. I'm from Brooklyn and I'm annoyed they don't have a 2nd location in Manhattan!! It smells great in here, I knew it would be good... so I tasted the meat first to see the quality.. sooo good!! Loved every bite. it's real small for a $9 burger that I paid... it almost looks like a White Castle slider but still... it was veryyyy good, combined with the side salad that was $4, I was full to the max! Open another location in downtown Brooklyn!! Bring good food to the hood lol"
858,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Oh so good was waiting to go for a while my friend went here and I saw his pics and I had to get there asap lol so I came with my husband and I was very happy with my end results
859,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I was working literally right outside the door today... So gave it a try. First off: I always appreciate a place that tries to distinguish themselves visually. I like the simple modern urban fee. Had really cool huge retro looking pendant lights hanging above the counter. Awesome lightbulbs. ....AND I had the turkey burger. Again, great visual presentation. The burger itself was great! Very good. Personally, I'm a big burger guy (I usually get beef) and to rave about a Turkey burger... it obviously impressed me."
860,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"The best burgers in the south Bronx!! So glad they open a burger spot !! Compared to shake shack , I would say milk burger won first place ! Loved it and will definitely be back ! Friendly staff as well since it was our first time , they offered another beer on them! So kind!"
861,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I loved/love Milk burger. !! my son and i have a top three burger place, 1- Shake Shack 2- Five Guys3- Smash Burger.... BUT - I think Milk Burger might bump all three of them and be crowned King..Its really yummy.. oily, savory, deliciousness"
862,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,I love the portabello burger. Hubby had the jalepeno burger and had no complaints. A lil pricey but the food and customer service is excellent! We came back the next day
863,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"My instant thought once I walked in was how great and small the location was that it gave the place a homie feeling. The cashier was extremely friendly and answered all of my questions. Once the food arrived, we tried the sweet potato fries and WOW! Is all I could think of to describe how great they were. The fries had the perfect garlic seasoning touch. Next, I ordered a turkey burger with jalapeño sauce (which really was jalapeño relish) and it was so moist and AMAZING! It was the perfect texture and taste that I have absolutely no complaints for this place. Lastly, the Oreo milkshake had the perfect amount of Oreo crunch and sweetness! After today's satisfying experience I will definitely be back!"
864,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Very good burger little bit on the pricey side but ambiance and staff being knowledgeable and helpful makes a great place to have a nice burger . Wow there guacamole is amazing good and fresh
865,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because they only have 1 register and if they taking orders in the phone you have to wait the whole time. Other than that this place is amazing. Had the turkey burger with fries and a strawberry shake. Food was amazing. Shake was average. Great ambiance. Nice music in the background and the customer service is two thumbs up. Will definitely go back and try other burgers. They also sell beer. Wish it was closer to home. We need more burger joints like this in the bronx.
866,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Burgers were ok. Not very tasty. And WAAAY overpriced for the size. Do yourself a favor and pay the same amount for a bigger burger AND fries by going to Gunn Hill just a few blocks away.
867,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great food, great vibe, it may be pricey but totally worth it. Food taste fresh and well prepared I promise it doesn't disappoint"
868,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great place! What we needed in the bronx.  Came in for drinks and some fries, left with a smile on my face and a new spot to hang out in.  Amanda was great, I wish I could have left her a tip with my card! Bring cash.  Shes awesome and so are the chefs and food!"
869,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,So upset !!! I usually have nothing but good things 2 say about this place !! But today I ordered a well done burger and after two bites i had to stop it was pink and looked like it wasnt cooked !!! my fries tasted under cook as well!!  I wish I lived closer cause I would have brought the food back !!!
870,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,2nd time eating here . I love there burgers !!! Not greasy or oily at all . The staff is friendly !!!
871,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"The food was of good quality and the staff seemed friendly;however, the reason behind the 2 stars are the size and price of the items. The burger was the size of a slider and on a supermarket bun for $10 and the fries were sold separately. They were also $4.00."
872,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Was super surprised by the location but when I went inside its very cosi, I got a Double Milk Burger with the work and Sweet Potatoes Fry's. Both were super good but those fires were so good. Ate my food at home but I craved more when I was done. Will definitely go back but this time with friends or family."
873,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great burgers, great atmosphere. The music was just loud enough that my conversation felt private. I got the jalapeño burger and the Oreo milkshake and it was fantastic! The staff was very friendly and helpful."
874,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"First, hats off to opening on Bruckner and St Ann's- bold move for a more upscale burger joint. Not sure how that happened, or why, but glad it did. Service was great- got our meal to go and it was fresh, friendly and quick. Burger - straight cheese burger. Very fresh, not greasy, fresh veggies, tasty potato roll a la shake shack. We missed the special 'milk' sauce  which wasn't on our burgers and I felt probably should have been. perhaps that's on us as careless orderersFries - crinkle - a little soggy but fresh. Probably the weakest link in the meal B&W shake- I thought it was great. Tasty, good consistency; thick but not too thick. Wifey was turned off as there were small chunks of frost in it. Diet Coke- in a can. it ought to be a fountain, right?And with that I leave you."
875,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Quick service and good food. The employees were very helpful and were able to give us recommendations on what to order. The vanilla milkshake with alcohol was actually pretty smooth which I wasn't expecting. Only con is location. Very hard to access if you're not driving. I would go back.
876,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,I drive by this place every day and have been meaning to stop by. Had an awesome Milkburger last week and a an awesome grilled chicken salad today. So happy to have found this spot. Fresh delicious and cooked to perfection food. Really nice staff too!
877,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I had the opportunity to eat at milk burger yesterday and along with the AMAZING MEAL, I found it pleasing to find such wonderful customer service KELSON was so attentive when, a mistake occurred with my order he was so ready to take responsibility and correct it.  Lately most places dont teach there employees customer service skills or dont care it's obvious at milk burger the service is as important as the food.  I came with 2 other people that where also impressed and although they may not make a review  milk burger for sure has 2 new customers"
878,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,A-mazing burger!! Had the guacaburger and OH BOY! out of this world! I live in Queens but it is definately worth the outta borough trip!
879,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Burgers were super tasty! The beer was good as well... the fresh strawberry lemonade was good as well -- would definitely order everything again!
880,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Delicious Burger spot. Very clean and fast service. A little pricey. Definitely will be back. Beats any burger in the area.
881,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Delicious, small burger. Milk sauce is good but after I showed them that they forgot to put the sauce on, they hardly added much on my burger. Prices are a lot more expensive than the picture on the menu. Look up menu from their website to see current prices. Less greasy than shake shack but not sure it's worth going back again for $8-10 small burgers. Maybe if I happen to be in the area."
882,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I gather the spot has been open for eight months since that was when the first review was posted here.The burger is consistent with the quality of a shake shack burger if you had just ordered a simple cheeseburger, etc. the onion rings are actually really good, crunchy and not oily at all. This will definitely be my go to spot when I'm craving an over-rated shake shack burger and I'm in the Bronx. Here was no line in the afternoon and service was quick and friendly! They have other offerings such as the jalepeno burger and guacaburger that are supposedly really good too so based on varied offerings and toppings they are probably better than a shake shack. Btw, same potato buns, with fresh green lettuce, tomatoes, onions and pickles as a shake shack burger!"
883,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Ok so I just finished eating a milk burger it was a good burger. Juicy and well put together it didn't curl my toes but it did hit the spot. For me the star was the pinion rings. They were the perfect size. Not to big and not too small. Very crispy and deliciously season. If you're craving a real burger and not frozen meat from a fast food chain give them a try. Oh and by the way now they serve drinks
884,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Very good burgers ... I had the fish burger it was surprisingly good ... I was with a group of people and had different burgers and they love it to... place it's very nice and cozy..
885,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Burgers were filling. My boyfriend and I stopped in after work for dinner/drink. The front staff girl was really helpful in helping us decide what to get and we ended up getting a double and a single milkburger and plain and sweet potato fries. The burger was juicy the fries were perfectly salted seasoned(sweet potato fries). We had the drinks recommended as most popular the Bronx cosmo and the Pom Pom.  We are definitely going back to this hidden gem. If you drove by and hesitated I assure you give it a shot.
886,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Awesome little spot for a burger...and now with a full bar.Just the place to go if you live in South Bronx or are passing through and need a burger & fries fix.  The burgers are juicy, flavorful really expertly cooked.  The onion rings are to die for.  I'd have given them 5 stars but they don't make their own condiments (Ketchup, etc...).  On a recent Saturday night our cocktails were expertly made and the music was great. Way more than you should expect from a barren stretch of Bruckner Blvd (it's about 5/6 blocks east of the mini restaurant row taking shape around Alexander and Lincoln Aves).  The staff is hyper attentive, it's like they really care.  So, you feel great about being inside there."
887,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Nothing to write home about.  Staff was friendly but too much hype for a burger that's the size of a slider.
888,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Excellent food, nice folks and great atmosphere. We love it! It's close to our place so it's convenient even though the road noise is annoying. Better for takeout. The location has very little parking but hey this is NYC so.."
889,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"The owner is so sweet and cares about your thoughts on the food. One of the best burgers I've very eaten. And they sell Bronx brewery beer which you cant be mad about. All in all, I'd suggest this place any day!! I have dreams about it"
890,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Super delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked.  I had the jalapeño burger and spicy fries- yummy heaven!  I highly recommend the food and service. Eric the owner was there and was friendly and  fond of his new spot!  Definitely coming back
891,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Burger was delicious as was the half and half. Only reason they're getting the 3 stars. Portions are tiny for that price, service was terrible, I don't understand how I asked for a menu and there's only 2 for the whole restaurant. I felt like I was bothering homeboy behind the counter when I ordered my food. This place will fail soon if they don't make some major changes. I was hyped af to visit and left so disappointed but still picking my teeth (probably cuz I was still hungry)"
892,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,A must stop if your in the area burgers are real tasty nice clean place nice crew working and the guy actually thanks you as your leaving ! Will be back
893,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Yo this places was amazing. From service to food OUTSTANDING!  Will be back again and again for the burgers
894,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"This is the best burger and fries I think I've ever had. 100,000% worth the hype. Make the trek. Puts Shake Shack to shame. If you are gluten free mention it and they will put it in a lettuce wrap. I can't remember the name of the item I had but it had portobello mushroom and two or three kinds of cheese on it with onions and some kind of sauce that was perfect.  I have anemia now, getting good bloody vitamins are no joke . Thank you Milk Burger! Everyone was super nice. The sweet potato fries were the best I've ever had too. Awesome staff, awesome food."
895,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,The staff is friendly and their brugers are amazing. I never imagined I wouldnt want to put ketchup or mayo on a burger until I ate their burger....these bite size burgers pack bold flavors. My favorite burger is the turkey burger ..best turkey burger hands down and their one of the few quality eating options by our school.
896,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"The place is pretty and clean inside. Food was delicious, service was friendly. The burgers are a tiny bit small, but the prices are still fair. No delivery or beer/liquor yet, but I'd be a repeat customer even without those things. :)"
897,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Went last night nice and clean everyone so friendly especially the tall guy. The food was fresh and great taste!!! I will be back soon.
898,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,Very nice the burgers were very tasty I had The portobello mushroom burger and my husband had the guacamole burger both were delicious and tasty and fries were very fresh Lucy and Jorge
899,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"I been coming to milk burger since their first location. Honestly, every time I've coming I receive the best care. Though I'm a picky eater, the food is absolutely delicious. And I am coming all the way from Bayside, Queens.!!"
900,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,the most delicious burger hands down!!!!!! ive tried lots of other burger places this is the best tasting!!! Staff and management very friendly as well!!!
901,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Great Burger place.  If you're  hungry get the double.  Table side service could be better, but everyone is friendly and the place is clean."
902,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"My craving for a juicy hamburger acquainted me with this place.While I was disappointed about the size of the burger, it was delicious ! The milkshake was also tasty and tasted natural.I'd definitely recommend this establishment.Next time,I'll simply  ask for a double.I am still a fan of Shakeshack,but I cannot deny that Milk Burger's burgers are less greasy and you don't get a heavy feeling after consuming it."
903,I1n43HOVBpR4_rccHOTS2A,"Good burger, but small. $16+ for a burger, fries and a can of coke is very expensive for the area. Parking is very difficult at lunch time."
904,BGChkQxHyzI6FP0nc0TYiw,"This maybe a deli in the middle of no where in Hunts Point but I'm sure it's a staple pit stop for many workers in the area.Trekking out to the Bronx on an early morning for work in the warehouse food district, my stomach was beckoning for a breakfast sandwich and this place answered my calling.Egg and cheese on wheat is my usual order and it can NEVER go wrong. They even telepathically read my mind and splashed some ketchup on my sandwich without asking. The girls at the counter were very courteous and welcoming. Service with a smile that comes with a delicious breakfast sandwich and coffee at 7AM. That's a way to start your morning. :-)THEN, my entire inspection was canceled and I had to schlep myself back into Midtown."
905,BGChkQxHyzI6FP0nc0TYiw,"First off, I would like to comment on the phone etiquette of the owner is disgusting!! We don't need you, you need us!!! Please do yourself a favor, and don't go there!"
906,BGChkQxHyzI6FP0nc0TYiw,"Everytime I come to hunts point coop, I always stop in and get some gyros. Delicious and fast since its a tight schedule coming in and out of here. Thanks"
907,BGChkQxHyzI6FP0nc0TYiw,WARNING!!! If you would like food poisoning then come to this place. My poor bf got sick for two weeks after eating a bacon egg and cheese from this place. Would not recommend.
908,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"This is a hidden gem ! The waitress is very welcoming and the place had a suprisingly nice vibe and decor. The food was as good as Jamaica ! Will def be back for their Happy Hour food. I notice all the negative reviews are people upset the the delivery service , NOT the restaurant so be aware that there dont represnt the actual place SMH"
909,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"I ordered from here a while back. Their curry is great, but the jerk chicken is not so much. Quick service and located at a very business area. Clean and respectful servers."
910,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,The food is generally delicious and authentic Jamaican Food....the vibe is amazing and the people are great.... my companion and I enjoyed it and we will be back ...
911,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"The restaurant is nicely decorated.There was also some nice 90's reggae music playing which I thought was nice. The waitress was attentive and friendly. They have a good happy hour for food! I ordered the jerk wings and shrimp with rice and beans. The jerk chicken was taste good, spicy and tender. The shrimp was a bit salty but the rice and beans were good."
912,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"Alright. Let me start by saying, any negative comment I have about this place was apologized for and they did try to make up for their mistakeFirst of all. The food was amazing. Five star food all the way. Sadly 1 star serviceThe jerk chicken was well seasoned to the bone and tender. The check came as a half chicken which included the breast. Ive actually never had breast included with jerk chicken. Its usually leg and thigh. It was well cooked and a pleasant surprise. I should also say that it wasnt to spicy. I also had the oxtail. Very good. Tender. Also very well seasoned with a subtle sweetness. I wish i had more but oxtails are almost always served in smaller portions. The dishes were served with the drippings from the meat to use as ""gravy"" for the rice and cabbage. Awesome idea!!! Rice and cabbage were both really good. I was seated right away as the dining room was empty. Sadly no one made an attempt to speak to me for about twenty minutes. Yes it took the wait staff 20 minutes to come take my order in an empty restaurant (I went for lunch) I timed it specifically for my yelp review. In conclusion the food was great but the service was trash. I really hope the front of the house does not end up bringing down the back of the house."
913,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"Food was gross and bland. It has no flavor at all. I ordered the Rasta pasta with jerk chicken. It arrived hot but it tasted like nothing. And the noodles were way over cooked. At 15.00 this good should have been amazing. Not only was the food expensive and bad, my order arrived incomplete. Yea No"
914,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"I ordered Rasta pasta ... I got Alfredo  I ordered rice and peas and got dry and hard rice. The stewed chicken was good. So I payed $20 Uber eats basically for one chicken breast cut up. Unbelievable. I knew it would be no ""Flavas International "" however, I thought it would at least be Jamaican food. There isn't anything Rasta about Alfredo."
915,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,Randomly came in here after making a run to a frie so house and I was pleasantly surprised a new spot opened up on his block. I went in and had a a great experience and meal. Delicious authentic jamaican food. Seems like the family is really from the west indies and they put their foot in this food! Delicious jerk chicken rice cabbable macaroni and cheese and plantains! I'll be back!
916,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,I order the oxtails from this store through postmates.  I even went in the store and picked them up. I've been experiencing extreme food poisoning. Be careful I'm thinking of calling the health department.
917,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,It's really was a 2.5 but my husband oxtails was ok.  In order brown stew chicken and what received looked like brown stew chicken but tasted like curry chicken. That was very disappointing because I was craving for what I order. What I can say is that the food arrive like 15 mins before the estimated time. Not sure if I will order from them again
918,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"I have to say that I'm only giving one star because there's no lower rating. The food or service in this place isn't pleasing at all. Upon walking into the spot the staff isn't welcoming nor very approachable. I spent about $75 dollars on two orders of oxtails with rice and peas with cabbage and a side order of Mac and cheese. I don't mind spending the money if it's worth it but all I got in each order were 3 dry oxtails. The Mac and cheese? Let's just say dollar tree max and cheese brand is better. However I found a spot called The Ox Box where I can get food food and even though it's in Mt. Vernon, The commute is well worth it. Mouth watering everything."
919,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,Excellent juices and food! Very kind staff! We are from Europe and it was a superior experience. We highly recommend it!
920,kFxtbYKHvIiez-O12Kdblw,"This place is absolutely terrible. We ordered 2 meals and 2 sides through Door Dash from here. About 10 minutes after we ordered I got a call from the restaurant stating they were out of the chicken and waffles which were the 2 entrees we ordered. For one of the entrees we opted to do fried chicken with bread in place of the waffle (terrible decision...). For the other, the restaurant let us get a Caribbean jerk chicken plate for the same price as our original entree. About 5 or 10 minutes later I got another call from the restaurant stating they were out of one of the sides we got (dumplings)... they subbed out Mac and cheese for the price of the dumplings. When the order arrived the restaurant had forgotten the plantains that come with the jerk chicken plate. The bread that came with the fried chicken meal was literally the thinnest piece of toast I've ever seen in my life... that was supposed to make up for a waffle... The side of plantains I got were so gross. They were hard and tasted like they had been sitting for hours. The fried chicken was gross too. It tasted like it had also been sitting for a long time. The Caribbean jerk chicken plate and the Mac and cheese were good at least which is why I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1. I do not recommend eating here."
921,srCCZsZGBsMxY4hZ1bJYYg,The best Mexican and Chinese food in the area. Grill chicken tostada salad very good. Everything very fresh.
922,Do86TIgNeqVgIC9peb9U1A,"This place is amazing!!! Their food is always fresh and flavorful.Oh and also great customer service,and clean!!! I order from here a lot and they never let me down.I definitely recommend Moe's."
923,Do86TIgNeqVgIC9peb9U1A,I liked this!  It's great to have another option.  They have more topping options and the food is flavorful--- like they use seasonings.  The prices were decent and it made for a nice treat as it was a random shoot after my mall run.I'll definitely do it again.
924,Do86TIgNeqVgIC9peb9U1A,"Came to the mall to look for a pair of sneakers and since they didn't have the shoes i decided to get something to eat. I really wanted chipotle but the mall doesn't have one. When i saw this place i thought it was gonna be some bland mall food. I ordered the steak bowl with lime rice, onions and peppers, lettuce,salsa with corn and a little bit of cheese on top. The food was amazing and the portion size is definitely more than enough for a hungry person.  This was a great post workout meal and if i'm in this area after my workout i will be back."
925,Do86TIgNeqVgIC9peb9U1A,"First time ever eating at this establishment, the food was amazing, flavorful and the two gentlemen were very friendly and hard working. The gentleman at the register named Chaouky was very friendly and professional. Definitely will eat here again. Two thumbs up."
926,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I have been coming here for a few years now.  It's my favorite go to place for any Puerto Rican meal.  The food is delicious and home cooked.  However... this summer I have stopped in to pick up breakfast few times.  And each time the breakfast is just not up to par.  At least with what I get.   Avena, or even the Mangu.  The Avena is too milky or lemony. Doesn't even taste like Avena.  The Mangu has a strange after taste not sure what that was.  Whom ever is the morning cook is should be checked on to make sure there is a consistency, quality and taste of food in agreement with standards of The Joes Place. The service and servers is good and they are kind and attentive Still my go to place for lunch and dinner."
927,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"The best of the best REAL Puerto Rican food in the ENTIRE Bronx.  Joe is Puerto Rican,  and as of 2019, JOE'S PLACE has greatly improved!!!! The customer service and waitresses are Latina, and very attentive and kind.  Thank you JOE!!!  You will always have my business, and my mom, and entire family and REAL friend's business."
928,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Although this restaurant is not the most beautiful or modern the people who run it work very hard and the food is good. The skirt steak was very good and so were the prices. Also, the mojito (I got coconut) was delicious. The owner was very kind. I would certainly go again"
929,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Food is good but veware tgey try to charge you $5 for A malta... gtfoh smh.. I food coukdnt settle well after hearing that.. Manager please..
930,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,The service is great they are fast and very nice.The food is amazing. They start you off with free chips and salsa which is just the beginning of the great food. I'd eat there every day if I could
931,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Best place in The Boogie Down Bronx to eat delicious Spanish Foos. The Chuletas, Mofongo, Steaks, Rice & Beans. I just can stop going there. The service is wonderful."
932,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,The monfongo de chicharron was delicious. The empanadas de cangrejo was on point. And the pernil with arroz y ganduoles was flavorful. Great atmosphere and excellent service! Well done Joe!
933,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"My first Puerto Rican Restaurant and what a find!!! I got to sit with Joe and hear his marvelous tales of culinary excellence from days gone by in Manhattan cooking for and with some of the finest in NYC. Joe is old school doesn't waste time with instant ingredients or short  cut methods. A master from the day of dry ageing steaks with sauces cooked out for days. Definitely a classical method to everything they do yet the amazing combination of Puerto Rican cuisine is the best!!! It's definitely worth the trip from Manhattan. Weekend brunch will be my next try!! Old world service with impeccable techniques in a friendly hospitable space! They have 3 seperate areas bar, restaurant and coffee bar with a large function area. Long live Joes!!! If you go ask for Joe he's definitely great company."
934,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"We had a family dinner this evening at Joe's Place. We had a reservation for 12, 5 of them being children. Since our guests were from South Carolina, I wanted to make this a special event and am always nervous about recommending an eatery.When we were seated, I asked than rather than to have us all at the long table, if we could have a separate table for the children. It was not a problem, and they treated the children as if they were million dollar guests. Our wait staff, Felipe and Sammy always go above and beyond to ensure that we are completely satisfied. Tonight we met Omar, the maître d (?). Although we were seated in the back, they constantly checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything met with our satisfaction. I had the shrimp in garlic sauce. It never disappoints. Everyone in our party left the table with bellies full and a few take out containers. I recommend this establishment for small or large parties. You won't be disappointed."
935,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"A relative recommended Joe's Place restaurant and my 1st time there was on a rainy Friday night we decided to go and let me tell you, what delicious fresh comida"
936,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,I had this restaurant in mind. Since I was in the neighborhood I went in to check it out. This place is so enjoyable. Had take out last night. The tostones were delicious. Had a salad w/grilled shrimp & avocado which was delightful. The salad dressing was so good. While waiting for order being cooked I had a Mojito which was on point. The staff were all friendly & very accommodating. Will definitely return to Joe's Place as soon as I can.
937,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,This is what I needed! Good old home cooked fresh food! Full of flavor. Very friendly staff. Right off the 6 train in the Bronx.
938,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Worst experience ever. We arrived and were seated frantically. We sat to only have 2 menus and not be attended for some time about 10 minutes. We ordered our food and that took about 45 minutes if not more to come out. Another table arrived after us ate and left and we were still waiting. We ordered drinks and the waiter was so overwhelmed he got it wrong twice. My food wasn't that great and the overall service at the table barely existed. The seafood sour had some foul tasting shellfish and my good was drenched in oil. The monfongo was decent and the steak and onion drenched in gravy. We are a happy family and didn't let it ruin our Father's Day but were so disappointed.
939,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Came for lunch. We had the chicken soup. Which was cold and we had to send it back.  Than we had a cuban sandwich, could be better.  Food and service where okay.  It was not busy and you had to look for the waitress.  The double expresso was watered down.  I won't be returning."
940,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"The food here is delicious. But the customer service was terrible!!! I was there for a family dinner for Mother's Day this last Sunday. The waiters didn't know what the heck they were doing. They didn't know the menu. They came to check on the table lie once every twenty minutes. They were very unprepared. Definitely you should improve on your staff and make sure they know what they are doing, and they should know the menu."
941,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Coffee hot and tasty, meal warm and comfort. The place is big  but cozy. Definitely will try them again, can't put my finger on it but just loved the breakfast."
942,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I attended a funeral which was held across the street from this restaurant and decided to sit for a meal.My mother and I was greeted and seated right away as there was really noone in there.The on the house starter for appetizer was garlic bread cut up in pieces. It was a good start. Nothing in would actually order so having it for free was cool.We ordered the seafood empanada as our appetizer. It was filled with mixed seafood and sauce which was really good.Our meals came with a salad and we requested the house salad dressing. Now the dressing was good. It had a little vinegar kick to it.Our main course was grilled pork chops. Sweet plantains was my side dish and baked potatoe was my mom's. There was also a small beets and mango salad that came with our meal.Themmmmmmm pork chops (you get 2) were on point. Grilled to perfection. The plantains were sweet. The beets and mango was different and enjoyable. I would definitely order this again.The portion size was good. We couldn't finish everything so we packed to go. Unfortunately, my son ate my leftovers. I should've hid it beacuse I really did NOT want to share my chops..LOLI WILL BE BACK!!!Ohhhh yeah I forgot to add that the flan was on the money!!!!"
943,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Waited 1 hour for our food!!! The worst!!! Service sucks too. Never again!!!If i could leave negative stars I would
944,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Don't understand the reviews.  I'll keep it in context.  If you are coming for some awesome Puerto Rican food and don't mind waiting a little longer than you might expect and it doesn't matter because you're enjoying the music and company, you will LOVE this place.  If you need a fast meal, grab it at the counter to-go.  Sit down service was polite and friendly.  Food was AWESOME.  Had the trifongo churrasco and it did not disappoint.  Caught the restaurant right where a local charity came through selling baked goods for donations.  Fresh coconut flan was INSANE.  Can't emphasize how much I enjoyed this lunch, salsa music playing.  Put me right back to a special vacation spot in Culebra.  Thanks to Joe and the staff for a memorable experience.  Will be coming back soon."
945,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Worst service everrr!!! My family walked in and the waiter didn't greet us and didn't give us menus The waiter saw us waiting and just walked around us - horrible service A couple came in 10 minutes later was greeted and given menus - So my family got up and walked out - instead we went to a better restaurant called Sabrosura a block away on Westchester Avenue
946,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Great place to sit down a few screw ups one the waitress gave my mother some rancid tamarin water then asked for a raspberry ice tea she gave my mother a kiwi strabery tea and shes alergic to kiwi another screw up was that their are a few flies around and after our lunch our waitress isnt arround to give our check but overall the food was great
947,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"This evening I wanted some Spanish food. I was on Westchester Ave. I decided to go to this restaurant because I'd purchased many gd sandwiches in the past. I ordered Roast Pork, rice and black beans and a salad.. I was soooo disappointed. The cut of the roast pork was dry and very stringy. At first I had the feeling of not feeling welcomed. If this is the case then I will no longer patronize this establishment.  Years ago, i felt welcomed,  this time not so much. One must remember we all somehow, someway come from the same fabric. So disappointed."
948,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Joe Torres---What happened to your Place?  Just over 2 years ago when we went,  all the food we ordered was good.  So good that we kept saying that we had to go back again sometime.Well...we finally got back there and brought our daughter with us.  She, like us, was happy to have some PR food, you know, good old comida criolla.We started with the pastelillos con queso---and it was a good start.  They were served piping hot, the crust was thin and flaky, the cheese portion was generous.  We oohhed and aahhed over each bite since each bite brought back memories of eating pastelillos back on The Island.  It all started to go downhill after the pastelillos.  Once again, I ordered Arroz con gandules y cerda.  The arroz con gandules was properly prepared, the rice was moist with plenty of gandules (pigeon peas).  However, the chunks of pork were overcooked and dried out.  I ended up leaving most of the pork behind.Our daughter got chicharrones de pollo sin huesos (sin huesos=without bones).  It came to the table looking like your basic chicken strips.  Most of the pieces were either overcooked and all were bland.My husband got bistec encebollada, his go-to dish at PR restaurants.  He said that the flavor was spot-on but by now you can guess it --- the beef was overcooked.We got a side of platanos maduros.  Do I have to say it?  Well... I guess I must --- they, too, were overcooked, and obviously so as they were brown instead of golden yellow.  My daughter pointed this out to the server, he took them back to the kitchen.  When he returned, he said that the kitchen was out of platanos maduros and would we like some tostones?  We declined because overcooked tostones...well...they're pretty bad when that happens.  At least, we weren't charged for the platanos maduros.The other saving grace was the rice and beans.  My husband and daughter each got a side of it as part of their meals.  The red beans were prepared guisado style (stewed) and the flavor and presentation were both spot on.  The white rice was properly done.What a disappointment, Joe Torres!  Your website name drops when it comes to celebs who have dined here.  I ask you---would your kitchen serve overcooked platanos maduros to Marc Anthony?We had to apologize to our daughter.  After all, we built up the dining experience here and she was looking forward to it.  Without prompting, my husband said that I have to update my Yelp review. That said, we do agree that we all liked the pastelillos con queso.  For some reason, most PR restaurants in NYC don't offer them on their menus---so, thanks for that at least, Joe Torres.In closing, we don't think that we'll schlep up to The Bronx again to eat here---and that's really a shame."
949,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"During our visits to NYC, I always aim to have a Puerto Rican meal.  Having found out about Joe's and seeing that pastelillos are offered on the menu, I knew that was where we would be heading this trip.It's easy to get to (the 6 train to Parkchester) and easy to find once off the train (2 blocks south on Westchester).We went about 5:30 p.m. on a weeknight and the place wasn't at all busy.  We were greeted warmly and given a table that sat 6 that was right by the window.  How nice it was to have all that space and have a view to boot!I don't know when others went but we found the servers to be very attentive and friendly.   They made us feel right at home.We started the meal with a pastelillo con queso.  PR restaurants in NYC seem to rarely have pastelillos on their menus so I was pleased to see it on Joe's menu.  The pastelillo came out piping hot---and perfect!   It was filled with a generous portion of cheese and the crust was thin and flaky---as it should be!  My husband had for his main course, bistec encebollado.  The steak was top sirloin, thin but I've seen thinner steak in this dish.  He was very pleased with the quality and preparation of the steak.  He also got rice and beans.  The waiter asked ""yellow or white rice?"".  My husband chose yellow.  Then it was ""red beans or black beans?""   With that question, my husband looked at me, I told him to go for the red beans.  To me, red beans are the only way to go when having PR food.  Again, he enjoyed them and pronounced them as being authentic.I got Arroz con gandules y cerda.  The waiter felt it necessary to inform me that the pork (cerda) comes mixed in with the rice.  Being half PR, I knew this already but I just smiled to myself and told the waiter that I was aware of this :)!  This was another authentic dish excellently prepared.  Sometimes arroz con gandules can come out on the dry side but at Joe's it is prepared properly.  My only complaint was that the portion size was enough to feed 3 people!  However, large portions tend to be the norm at PR restaurants.In addition, we got a side of platanos maduros (sweet).  They, too, arrived piping hot and very flavorful.To drink, I had what the menu said was fresh squeezed lemonade---and it was that way---plus it wasn't overly sweet or tart---just right.  My husband had a beer.I don't know why a previous poster thought that the food was expensive.  We didn't think it was.  In fact, we were impressed at how much food we got for $39 before the tip!We will be back, to be sure!  This is now our favorite PR restaurant in NYC!"
950,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Came here for dinner with a few friends the other night. Flies and gnats flying all over the place. The food was decent and the drinks seemed watered down.   The next day my friend told me he saw a dead waterbug under the table. He didn't tell me right away because he knows I am scared of them.
951,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"My girlfriend and I have been going to Joe's for years! We decided to go tonight for a quick dinner and left very disappointed. There only seemed to be 1 waiter serving everyone and it took about 20 minutes for him to come and take our orders. He left the table without taking our drink order so I stopped him when he passed by again. We waited about 10 minutes and didn't get our usual bread or salad, nor our drinks. So we left."
952,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,LOVE joes place. Been here numerous times as I live in the neighborhood. Just like grandmas cooking. Can't go wrong with anything on the menu food is delicious.
953,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I went here yesterday and the staff walked all around me didn't take my order, me being the only black woman in there, don't speak spanish the odds were against me.  A spanish lady came in after me and right away they took her order.  I tried to ask the waitress what happened? I was waiting and this lady walked in and you took her order, still being ignored getting very angry at this point and helpless as no one seem to speak english.  Mind you the only reason I walked in there, my husband is Puerto Rican and ask me to pick up a chicken soup and white rice.  Finally! finally! after I kept saying excuse me finally one of the staff took my order.  Turns out it was not worth the trouble, as the soup and the rice was both salty which spiked my husband's blood pressure.  Never again would I go in there,  WARNING! if you are black and don't speak spanish stay away!! Plus, the food is horrible!!"
954,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"What a horrible experience!! My family & I came here today to get some ""good"" Puerto Rican food and what a waste, we got here a little after noon and there were maybe two other sets of patrons in the dining area. We were thrilled at that aspect because hey less people SHOULD mean awesome service but that is NOT the case here. First they were trying to squeeze us in to a table with 5 seats when we needed 6 (we were 8 people 4 adults 4 kids) they finally offered us a table we could actually fit at comfortably towards the back. The lady who sat us seemed like she could've been on point but unfortunately we had an older male ""server"" ‍ OMG he didn't introduce himself, he took forever to write down each persons order, he didn't ask if we wanted drinks, the bread brought to the table was cold obviously it was not a good start. To make matters worse there was NO heat on in this establishment (who can eat comfortably when they're freezing on such a cold day as it is). Our appetizer came WITH our meal which is completely ridiculous and the meal was SLIGHTLY warm if that! Each persons food came at separate times AND not complete mind you .... for example the pernil came out with no rice or beans then 3 minutes later the next persons meat came out with the 1st persons side so that person had to wait for their side now all of this crap andddd we had to deal with nats flying around while we at too! Finally when this ""server"" comes to the table (he would disappear for at least 5 minutes between ONE plate) we ended up telling the guy we need drinks and he gives us an of course look as though he was just going to ask  my children had to eat with their coats on and no one finished anything because of it being so lukewarm when brought to the table that it just got so cold so quickly it became inedible. I had to wash my hands after I ate this terrible meal (my steak was gristly, my husbands pernil was bleh at best) so I go to the bathroom and it's even more cold down there like HOW?!?! Once inside there's a huge puddle of whatever liquid all over the floor it was DISGUSTING! The cherry on top was the server and the lady hovering over us AFTER we had already paid, when my 2 month Old needed to be fed and since we had spent over $100 (even leaving a healthy tip for such poor service and lack luster food because we know waiters live off tips) AND there being many tables available I think I should be able to feed my infant without feeling like we need to rush out. Needless to say this will be the last time my family and I come here! If you value good customer service & a good meal DO NOT come here  Joeys Place."
955,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,We were with friends looking for a place that had authentic Puerto Rican food like Mamma used to make... Joe's delivered! Food is great tasting and the servings are enough to fill you for days. The staff was very friendly and the food came out on time and hot. Not sure if I'm being too picky but the utensils looked like they went through a war... might be time for replacements. The decor could use a few touch ups also but besides that we enjoyed ourselves and will definitely be back.
956,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"This place is falling to the ground fast. The hours say 8-12am. You'll be lucky if they open by 8:30 and when they open, nothing is ever ready. The service is slow and you get ignored until you speak up. I guess they lost another customer."
957,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Father in law brought us here and glad he did.  The pernil was great and flavorful.  Wife had mofongo and said it was great! Red beans and rice taste just like Cuban red/ rice.  Pricing was very good as well.
958,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Last night me and a friend of mine decided to stop here for a drink and received terrible service from the bartender .  She practically stayed over in the corner laughing and talking to a couple of guys our whole visit .  My friend and I came in and sat at the bar we ordered our drinks she made them , then went back to the corner . I then wanted to order food as I tried calling for her she showed no interest in wanted to serve us . She never told us her name . I began saying excuse me multiple times  . Another customer at the bar had to tell her I was trying to get her attention after 15 minutes of trying . Our drinks are now done she comes over I ask her for a menu she gives it to me then she walks back to the corner to finish her conversation with the guys . My friend now calls her to tell her we need another which she should have asked being that our drinks were low . She then came after another 10 minutes I ordered my salad and she refilled our drinks !!!  Now the salad took about 1 hour to come ! And the whole hour she sat in the corner talking to the group of guys again !as she walked over to make one of the guys a drink I stopped her and asked her how long for the salad . Which she should have been checked on instead of  standing in the corner talking to guys . She never checked she just told me that it's going to take a little while cuz the restaurant was busy . So after over a 1 hour period the salad comes my drink is gone and she again never asked if I would like another one . At this point I don't even want the salad but I am starving . I began to eat she never came over asking if I wanted another round or a glass of water . So at this point I am ready to curse her out and walk out !!!! My friend then tells her I needed a glass of water . I eat some of my salad ask for a box to go and we paid our bill and left . If it was up to me she would have never gotten a tip . Service was terrible . Had she been on point we would have spent a lot more money !!!!"
959,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"OMFG! We got to the restaurant at around 645pm, we ordered at around 7pm we did not get our food till 845pm. This was COMPLETLY unacceptable. During that 1.5 hrs they did not bring us more water, they didnt ask if we were ok, they kept telling us the food was coming, the waiter was avoiding eye contact, literally the WORST service I've ever gotten. The food was salty, the seafood was overcooked and one of the lobsters had a weird taste to it. I will never come back here."
960,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Joe's Place was the best Cuban Sandwich spot in Parkchester years ago. Their breakfast, lunch, & dinner were on par with most of the other Latino restaurants in the area. Once it started getting too popular the prices went up, and the quality of the food plummeted. Now you're expected to pay $15 for Carne Guisada with rice & beans that leave much to be desired. Some of the waiters are short tempered. Expect to be ignored if they're busy. They seem to be under staffed which is unfair to both the waiters and customers. If you want good food for a good price, you'll have better luck at any of the other Latino restaurants in the area."
961,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Mother's Day Disaster! Waited half hour for someone to take our order. We had to hound the waitress for my daughter's soda. Waited OVER an hour for calamari appetizer! At this point, restaurant was clearing out and three new tables arrived. It is now two hours into being here and everyone got their main course except for us. At this point, I'm pretty upset as I have other things to do on my day. I go over to the  manager who walked over in shock that we still  hadn't gotten our food. Right then, our food magically appears. Waitress claims the delay was due to our appetizer. Are you kidding me?! Over an hour for calamari and that's okay?!?! NEVER AGAIN!!! Worst service ever and it wasn't insanely packed. Thank God bread kept us full! Smh"
962,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Food was horrible no taste.   I went here about 10 yrs ago and I thought the food was good then but they sure have gone downhill.  First we ordered fried calamari and it was very salty.  They gave me a salad with some old iceberg lettuce that was wilted. When the meal came, they gave me fried pork chops when I ordered broiled.   They tried to insist it was broiled when they were fried.   That got me mad.   Yellow rice had no flavor and they gave the wrong beans at first. Also pork chops were the low quality one not center cut chops I usually get in other resturants. They tried to appease me by giving me steak with onions which I rarely enjoy beef.   The one thing that was good was the flan.   Very disappointing.   I will never come here again.  Don't try to palm off fried when it should have been broiled."
963,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I Used To eat at this Place Before But refused to ever go there again after 3 incidents. Strike 3 Your Out! First I went in one Sunday with my Fiancee we Both ordered She Got Her food and ate and I never got My Food everytime I questioned them they would reply that they were Preparing it. and all I ordered was a mondongo Soup. In The second Incident they took like 20 Years to bring us cutlery. In the 3rd My Fiance'sdinner was not fully cooked. I gave it one star because  This website does not give You the option of giving it ""No Stars"" ."
964,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"This is my 'go to' place when I want authentic, delicious Puerto Rican  food.  On Tuesdays I travel pretty far to get his amazing Sopa de Gandules, full of smoked ham hocks and plátano balls that compete with the gandules and rice in the stew.  On Saturday mornings you may find notables at his counter having super creamy cinnamon oatmeal.  on any given night you have access to a varied assortment of delicious proteins along with white rice and heavy, delicious red beans that you must accompany with tostones.   A great place for any occasion.  Come to think about it, I am going back tomorrow."
965,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"It's no Brisas!  The Carne Mechada was on the dry side and the Yellow Rice, Corn and Pork- sounded great- was strangely yellow and a bit bland, with overcooked pork.  The best dishes were a salad with ripe avocado and the Tres Leches cake."
966,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"So disappointed. My family and I have been going to Joe's for authentic Puerto Rican food for the past 8 or so years and we have never left disappointed, that was until today.   My husband and I ordered 2 shrimp empanadas/pastelillos and 2 crab meat empanadas/pastelillos which were really good.   Then we ordered octopus salad and seafood paella.  We were so disappointed.  The paella smelled too much like seafood, and we all know that seafood should not smell fishy. On top of it, it had no flavor but if salty is a flavor, then... The octopus was like eating small pieces of salty rubber.  Gross!   Hope they get their act together.  Would hate to see them go."
967,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"POOR! The food isn't great. The service is really bad. They don't listen when you are ordering your food. They talk over you as you are trying to talk to them. The waitress brought us cheese cake which was and tasted awful...we told her...she stared at us, took the plate and threw away the cake... she didn't ask us what was wrong with it ...she didn't ask us if we wanted to try another piece...just threw it away. The BEST part was that it was STILL on our bill!! WHAT????? We asked her about it... and she stared at us for about 2 minutes and then asked for the money for the bill!!! MEOW? At that point we asked to speak to Joe, He comes out ...we tell him the story, he says something to her, she gives us a correct check without a word! MEOW MEOW????? REALLY??? Ok, so NEVER will we be back! What a shame...AND SHAME on you JOE...this is YOUR restaurant. YOUR FACE IS ON THE BILLBOARD right above the restaurant. SHAME ON YOU!!!"
968,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,I ordered a combo special half a chicken rice and beans and it  was all good the children was juicy the been was good the delivery man came  in like ten minutes  the only  reason  I'm not giving  them 5 stars was because  the rice was a Lil hard but for $10.50  not bad
969,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"This place is awesome five stars all the way, great sevice with great food."
970,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Absolutely delicious! Great prices for HUGE portions. I definitely recommend the fried steak, tostones, and mojo."
971,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Went to dinner with my family. The staff was warm and friendly. I started of with a Mamey batida, it wasn't too great considering no sugar was added. I had the mofongo which was good. The chicharron within the mofongo was good but there were like 3 strips out on the plate that seemed as if they came out a 50 cent bag.My husband had the grilled chicken breast with tostones. The chicken had no seasoning whatsoever, the tostones were ok. My fatherinlaw got the grilled porkchops (i envied him because there were 2 perfectly grilled porkchops). My motherinlaw got the arroz con gandules and pernil. The plate was ok, nothing out of this world. I just don't know about this place, i have mixed feelings. The food was not out of this world and was lacking in every aspect."
972,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I've lived in the area for over 12 years and I'm a little embarrassed to say that I had never eaten at this little gem but tonight while trying to figure out what to have for dinner I found the name of Joes. We checked out the menu and ordered pork chops, roast pork (pernil) and chicken chunks (chicharron de pollo). Each order came with rice so we ordered white rice and rice w pigeon peas (arroz con gandules). First off... They deliver! Awesome! Second... The lady who took my order was sweet and courteous and the guy that delivered was very nice. More importantly, the food was awesome! Generous portions means left overs for tomorrow and everything was yummy! Tostones were perfectly cooked. Chops and pork was moist and well seasoned! AND I had dessert! Flan! Yummy! Next time we will dine at the actual restaurant but for delivery they were great! Highly recommend!"
973,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Visited this place twice in the last year and service was awful. Both times, we waited forever to be seen by the waiter. On our last visit we waited for an hour for our food to come out. The wait could have been forgivable if the food was great. But it was just descent. Could have gone elsewhere with better tasting food and way better service. At the end of our latest visit they switched the server on us without telling us and our bill was all messed up. Horrible experience. I was really hoping this place would shape itself up, but I was highly disappointed. I had fond memories of this place when the food was great and the service was descent. Now, I couldn't recommend this place. Sorry!"
974,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Good service but music was too freaking loud, its almost like a damn club. The food was terrible and bland, no respect for the food at all. I have no idea why people gave this place high marks. Im sorry but the truth hurts, this place is a sinking ship!"
975,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Went here to get some spanish food. I was please with what they had. They just need a bigger selection of foods when they do their lunch specials. The food tasted good.
976,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Excellent place for Latin food & customer service. I have frequently visited Joe's for over 10 years. Small groups, family time, and date night friendly. I love the chuletas a la parilla with white rice and beans. My boyfriend always gets skirt steak. Our young daughter likes their rendition of a white sauce spaghetti which is not on the menu.This is a restaurant where 90% of the food is really good on any day (don't care for the chicharrones de pollo) and the staff really cares for their customers' satisfaction. Not a trend found in your typical ""spanish"" restaurants."
977,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Great place to go and have just a good home cooked dinner.  The rice Pork with Pigeon Peas/ Arroz con Guandules was so good! And the Mashed Green Plantains Stuffed w / Shrimps  also known as Mofongo Relleno de Camarones was just so awesome....the one thing I was looking forward to eating, which was the tres leche cake, did not really impress me, it was a little to dry for my taste and not that authentic tres leches taste and feel. Other than that, the food is great!  They have a bar and great music. The people are very social and all seem to just want to have a nice time there.  I just wish non of those promotional models had approached our table with offers to drink larger quantities of alcoholic beverages.  I just wanted a nice dinner with my boyfriend, with no interruptions. That should have been left for the bar area.  The staff was attentive and friendly.  It's good food."
978,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Good for breakfast and dinner not sure for lunch did not enjoy it last time it depends what you order but overall is good.
979,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Simply awesome. Traditional Puerto Rican food. Patitas and chuleta kan kan. The best in a very long time. Nothing else compares
980,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,Food is very tasty. Very old school. Owner needs to pay attention to detail a little better. Maybe add another server. One person taking care of everyone not good. Other than that the piña coladas were great like the island!
981,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Been going to joe's for years and it's one of my top spots in the Bronx. Great atmosphere,great service,excellent bar,good Latino music playing,and of course great food!! Can be quite romantic after a few drinks and a hot date. Love the churasco, bistec encebollado,chicharon de pollo. For a drink, try the mojitos..love 'em! Comidas latinos represented lovely. Boricua's don't play,especially with their comida!! ...and joe's,don't play!!"
982,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I came here for a brunch, large group of approximately 40. They only had 3 servers for the entire party & the servers seemed very lost when were asked questions and got all of our orders mixed up. When I was done with my salad, I placed my utensils on the plate and the waiter, removed them and placed them back telling me I need those for my entree. I've worked in restaurant and catering business and personally I wouldn't want to reuse a dirty utensil for my next course. Asides from all, from 1-5 the decor of the place is a 3.5, the food is a 5. I would return but not in planned matter."
983,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Went there for my sister's birthday dinner (local friends and family) towards the end of September. It is a nice Puerto Rican/Dominican spot with pictures of celebrities that have visited. There is a small bar on the right side with an attractive bartender as well Food:Amazing steak. I asked for medium and got it just how I like it. The ""chicharones"" were decent, but tasted a bit like they had been sitting for some time. The ""mofongo"" could have been warmer but was still good.""Drinks:Usual beers and some wines. Nothing special.Service:Very friendly and fast. The moment the wauter saw us low on drinks he would come over to refill. He did come over a lot (at least 3 times) to ask how the food was but maybe I'm just nit picking here."
984,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I came to Joes's Place with my mother thinking we would be able to get some authentic, flavorful Spanish cuisine. For starters, we were given a house salad which consisted of nothing but a handful of soggy iceberg lettuce, one single tomato chunk and drowning in salad dressing, and the bread was hard and stale. Next I ordered the Seafood Paella, and my mother ordered the Surf & Turf. After waiting close to an hour for our food, it finally arrives and looked delicious. Sadly, that's all that it did was LOOK delicious. My rice was extremely dry and tastes old and reheated. The crab legs barely had any meat inside, the lobster was literally black and rotten looking inside, and the shrimp and oysters were dry. They also added huge chunks of un cooked green peppers. In addition to this horror show, our table was swarming with flies!!!!!!!!! There were maybe 2 or 3 before the food was brought out but once the food was on the table, they were everywhere INCLUDING MY FOOD! I was totally disgusted and it was to the point where I could no longer finish my already less than appetizing meal. My poor mother did not enjoy her meal either. Her lobster was overcooked and dry and black on the inside as well. Even if the food had been up to par, there was no way we could've enjoyed it because of the flies being everywhere. We eventually got the attention of our waiter to explain what was going on and he then took our food to the back. We he brought out our bill, he took $20 off of it. FIRST and LAST time I will ever go there. If you're looking for great quality food, DO NOT go to Joe's Place!"
985,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,I went to Joe's  Place on Saturday for some authentic Puerto Rican cuisine. What I got was a plate of over cooked chicharon de pollo. The waiters were slow and and the food after 45 minutes arrived cold. I  had a drunk patron talking loud and using propane language.  All this occurred while the owner Joe sits around doing nothing.  He doesn't even check if the patrons are alright.  If you want good Puerto Rican food. Don't eat at Joe's.
986,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"absolutely great service, attentive waiters, very nice owners are always making sure your needs are satisfied and get your moneys worth, great prices for fabolous food and drinks a great place not only to dine with a friend but for special occasions i had my daughters birthday party here and was more than satisfied with my experience!!"
987,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I've been to Joe's numerous (7-8) times.  The food is always delicious and the service is great. They are able to create the staple Puerto Rican dishes with a slight gourmet flair. Try the Pastellios, Pernil, Mofongo or the Carne Mechada.  Top that with a pitcher of Sangria and the perfect ending is the Tres Leches dessert.  If you enjoy good ""Criolla"" food (Puerto Rican, Dominican, Cuban) you will not be disappointed."
988,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I went there for a dinner party .  Typical Latin American style food.  It was ok.   The service was good.   My broiled chicken breast was a bit dry and needed more garlic.  The arroz con gandules was tasty.  A bit out of my way, maybe I will visit it again if I have business in the Bronx."
989,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Went to Joe's this past August. I was pleasantly surprised. The staff was great. Our waiter was really down to earth and funny. I ordered the steak and my gf ordered the breaded chicken breast. OMG they served me half a cow. My steak was HUGE. My gf's chicken was just as large. Talk about getting your money's worth. I had a long island iced tea which was pretty strong. My waiter was nice enough to sneak me an extra drink while my gf was using the restroom LOL. They also have a side take out area and the bar is closed off by glass partitions for those who just want to grab a drink. Nice puerto rican spot, good service and great food. I recommend it!"
990,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,I think the people giving this place HIGH ratings work here...I just don't taste what they're talking about...but if BLAND FLAVORLESS food is ur thing...then this is UR spot...
991,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I bought a Cuban Sandwich, Mofongo and Tripe (Mondongo) Soup....ALL HORRIBLE!!!!!!...First off...the Cuban Sandwich as bad because good Cuban's are supposed to have real roast pork (Pernil) in it...this had thick sliced pork, somewhat like a cold cut, the Mofongo was dry and flavorless and the Tripe (Mondongo) Soup had absolutely NO FLAVOR...sorry...but this restaurant is a FAIL...it sucks too because it looks like a nice place...Oh I have to say...the only good thing I had was the white rice..."
992,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"I use to come here a lot a couple of years ago. I went back on Sunday for the first time in years and wasn't to happy. My server took long to come to my table. After sitting there for so long I asked the host for some water and he told me to wait for my server he was coming didn't like that answer. Finally after sitting there for about 10 minutes he came. I finally got my water and my order was taken. The food arrived pretty quick. My gf had a cuban sandwich which we both loved. I had the Chicharron de Pollo Sin hueso, I loved the rice and beans but I felt like the chicken needed more seasoning. At the end we waited for more than 10 min for our check the server kept looking at us and hinting with his face he didn't forget us he will get the check soon which took about another 10 to 15 minutes almost. Once we got our check the amount was wrong it was doubled he didn't add it right. Finally he fixed it and instead of someone else charging my card he did it and I noticed while I was waiting for him everyone else in the section was looking around for him. My advice to this restaurant the server should be kept at the tables and there's should be a check out station so me and the other customers don't have to wait so long for one person. My experience here wasn't to good and most likely I wont be coming back anytime soon."
993,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Great place for dinner and breakfast , if you stop by try there mofogo and eggs, you'll love it. and if you go there at night try there steak rice and black beans, you will keep coming back."
994,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"The atmosphere is nice here. The food taste really good and home-made. They specialize in making mofongo, a mash of deep-fried green plantains with roasted pork and garlic that gets molded into a giant thimble shape and served amidst a moat of beef soup. They serve fresh crisp salad with your coice of dressing, warm bread with butter on the side and a glass of water once you are seated. The servings are huge. They serve plates such as arroz con pollo, which arrives in a covered tin dish to keep the spiced rice and tender chicken warm. I recommended a nice Piña colada, $6; mofongo, $10 or arroz con pollo, $9. There is also a bar in a glass wall-enclosed room."
995,N3h_AvXupuxFHDXhKWwxUw,"Food was good, a bit pricey for not being in the city.  The service was only so so.  The waiters were not very friendly or attentive.   So while our experience could have been better had the service been more up to par, it was a decent place."
996,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Great place Great coffeeThis time I order the house salad with Avocado and grilled vagiDefinitely one off the best salad and best value Will come again and again
997,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Pros: 1) nice vibe; 2) great customer service; 3) nice waiter; 4) music; 5) yummy latteCons: 1) seating area looks very boring, no decorations and too dark; 2) water from faucet in the restroom comes out very low, couldn't wash my hands; 3) forks is plastic."
998,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This is really a nice cute little place. Super small with 4 tables in the back. You will be waiting awhile if it gets crowded. Came here to meet a great friend of mine. The menu is small with limited selections between breakfast and lunch. The person who served us, whom I believe is the owner, was fantastic. I chose the Love breakfast which is your basic 2 eggs how you want it with a choice of meat (bacon, sausage patty, ham or turkey bacon) with fries, home fries or hash with a choice of toast. It was really good and fresh. I wish they could add omlettes to their menu. But overall I was satisfied with my meal. My friend had the E Love breakfast and she loved it as well. It has grilled chicken, onions, egg whites and home fries. She gave me some to try and loved it as well. Enjoy!"
999,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I would rate Love Cafe 6 stars if I could. Walking into Love Cafe, I noticed it looked more like a bar type of setting with about 10 bar stools, which surprised me a bit considering I saw some tables and chairs on Yelp. However, I actually liked this setup more because it lets you interact with the staff and customers better. I loved how everyone seemed to know each other as if they had been friends for years. The cafe was filled with laughters and smiles of strangers brought together. When asked what I wanted to order, I had gone with a classic - a short stack of pancakes. Out of curiosity, I ask what ""the works"" is for pancakes, and the server told me it's pancakes with: whipped cream, chocolate syrup, caramel syrup, powdered sugar, and cocoa powder. Last minute I decided to get the pancake with the works, and she let me add in ""the works"" even though I had already ordered a regular short stack of pancakes! The pancakes were HUGE. They were definitely short, but they were also about 9 inches in diameter! They almost filled up the whole plate! ""The Works"" definitely sealed the deal on the pancakes. The whipped cream was so fluffy and airy; the powdered sugar and two syrups added some sweetness to the pancakes, but not to the point of feeling like I was drowning in sugar. Even with everything added on top, I was still able to taste the crispy edges and soft middle of the pancakes. Even while trying to eat the pancakes, J (Jay?) introduced himself to me and got to know more about me. He even jokingly said I did well for almost finishing all of the pancakes, as most people don't finish them! From watching others laugh and smile to bringing me into the conversation, it felt like J has brought me into the Love Cafe family. Cheap prices (CASH ONLY), great food, and wonderful customers/staff members are all I can really ask for. Love Cafe is a model restaurant proving to others that places don't have to be fancy in order to be quality. Come for the food, stay for the love.*Disclaimer: J told me that Love Cafe closes on the weeks of July 4 and I believe August 3. I have seen some people say they tried to come here during operating hours, but it was closed. Make sure to keep these dates in mind!"
1000,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This was one of my favorite weekend brunch places when we lived at East Harlem and I'm a little late in writing this review.First off, the breakfast meal which comes with buttered toast, eggs, tostones and sausage is just so fantastic. Everything is cooked perfectly. I especially love their tostones. And the coffee is always good and freshly brewed! That alone makes a really good reason to go.On certain weekends where we go an hour before they close and we haven't eaten a thing the whole day, we add pancakes and have become one of our favorite pancakes when eating out. It's just the right combination of fluffiness and deliciousness. We've never ordered any toppings because with the butter and syrup it already is perfect! Small, charming, and the owner is warm and friendly, you can't go wrong here. Looking forward to coming back again soon!"
1001,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This is the cutest most loving cafe ! Very friendly staff. Food was delicious and very well made .good for dates . Romantic diner for a quick breakfast. I will return soon .
1002,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,If there was one word to describe the food I would say: DRY. The French toast was lacking maybe it needed the works or something but it def needs work! I had the pancakes with strawberries which was ok. Had a lot of cinnamon and I could honestly make the same quality in my house. The eggs were supposed to be scrabbled but came as a mix between scrabbled and omelet. Also when we asked to have tomatoes and spinach in the eggs he said I needed to order an omelet which is super confusing because I wanted the eggs scrambled. He proceeded to say I could have tomatoes and spinach on the side which defeated the purpose lol. I really liked the bacon and the iced coffee was awesome the front area is cute. The back seating area was a bit scary and even had cardboard up against the wall we were sitting. The server was nice and the price was good. Food could use some work but I would return.
1003,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Returned to Love Cafe sooner than I thought and ordered a bacon, egg and cheese on a waffle. The bacon was a tad bit salty but honestly it matched well with syrup giving me a sweet n salty mix. Still in love with this place so ofcourse I'll be back."
1004,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,I'm so glad I decided to come to Love Cafe. I ordered a short stack (2 large pancakes) with bacon & eggs. This meal was about $6/$7 and it was well worth it. I didn't finish everything on my plate because the pancakes alone were very filling. The staff were soooo friendly and very attentive. Can't go wrong with good customer service.It's not a large place to dine but if you're in the area it would be a great place to stop by. I have so much more to try off their menu so I'll be returning soon!
1005,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Delicious food, love the employees! Jay and Pat always make you feel welcome and comfortable. This place is little but it packs a mighty punch. Will always continue to come here."
1006,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Cute little coffee shop on pleasant avenue! Warning: Cash only! I ordered a grilled cheese with American cheese and a small vanilla chai. The grilled cheese was scrumptious but, my drink was lukewarm.Nonetheless, I would stop by again."
1007,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"So we usually go downtown for brunch but we're told to try this little spot in East Harlem. I am so glad we did. I had a delicious coffee and my friend had some tea. We then ordered eggs (with cheese, onions, and peppers), home fries, a Belgian waffle and the French toast. The food was served quickly and was so fresh and good. It is down home style food and everything was made with love. The waitress, owner, and even chef came out and talked to us a bit. The vibes were on point, the service was top notch, and the soul music softly playing in the background made digestion that much better. We will definitely return :) TL;DRSKIP THE DOWNTOWN BRUNCH AND TRY THIS EAST HARLEM JOINT OUTYou will not be disappointed, especially on a Saturday morning when there's less traffic and available seating at the bar or in the back.There's also a Target and Costco nearby if you have any shopping to do."
1008,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Food is great, took a little while to prepare but service was awesome. Will definitely be returning. Not ideal for big parties but a cute lunch date."
1009,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Awesome hospitality, great prices and fantastic strong coffee!I love that they had a high protein option for breakfast-egg whites, avocado, homefries, sautéed onions and chicken with jalapeños!!Will def be back when in the city! Thanks!"
1010,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Totally worth coming here for breakfast almost everyday. The owner and staff are so friendly and make you feel like family. They definitely remember people in the community and it's easy to find yourself a ""regular"" here. It's a small hole in the wall in the best sense. No frills, just good food, portions, and prices."
1011,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Food is on point, good place for an intimate breakfast/brunch.If you plan on sitting, just get there before or after the school rush!"
1012,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Stopped in several weeks ago at my daughters request for breakfast. We sat in the back and enjoyed great service and a perfectly sized portion breakfast. Because of the lack of space and foot traffic; Id definitely visit again but will take my breakfast to go.
1013,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Wouldve been 5 stars since i love the atmosphere but i cant enjoy food with hair in it. Just purchased a sandwhich for myself and daughter, only to find a long thick black strand of hair mixed in my eggs. Hair nets are a must for long hair in any food establishment. 2 stars for the atmosphere."
1014,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"My new favorite place! This tiny little place is a gem. I just had one of the best bacon, egg and cheese sandwiches I've had in a very long time. At owner Pat's suggestion, I had it on a croissant instead of a hard roll. It's decadent, but totally worth it. It may seem strange to wax poetic about a simple breakfast sandwich, but it was delicious. They don't skimp on the eggs and they top it with a healthy (ok, maybe not exactly healthy) serving of bacon.The coffee was outstanding. Pat told me it's a special blend. It was bold but not overbearing, with a hint of sweetness, and extremely low acidity.And the whole package was only $5! What a deal!"
1015,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I've been a sporadic customer for years. I find myself in the neighborhood a few days each year and would always go to Love for a drink/biteToday I was told that the owner is a huge Trump supporter (there's a photo of the Orange one behind the counter) ... so I'll take my business elsewhere. Politics can be a private matter. But for this guy to make a living in East Harlem while waving the MAGA freak flag proudly doesn't sit well with me. I'll support businesses that support their employees, customers and neighbors."
1016,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Heads up this place is cash only. I didn't realize this until we got there, but this was easily fixed by buying some essentials at the Target around the corner. I got the French toast ($6) with bananas for an additional $1. It was a little heavy on the cinnamon and I wish I had known to ask for whip cream on the side! My friend got the bacon/eggs/cheese on a Belgium waffle. While it was delicious, you only get 1/4 of a waffle for $7 making it really overpriced. By itself, it's not filling enough. I also got a toasted, buttered croissant which was the highlight. They ran out of soy milk after we ordered our coffee drinks, so we weren't able to try any. Love Cafe has incredibly affordable prices and the owner is the one on the floor taking all the orders, bringing them out to you...this is a little out of the way for me so I don't think I'll be back, but m happy to have this place in East Harlem!"
1017,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,I can't believe I've never stopped into this neighborhood gem. Perfect for a casual meal before or after a target run. Food was delicious and service was very friendly.  Will definitely visit more frequently.
1018,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This place is a true hole in the wall, but it's a gem. I took off a star for the ambiance or lack thereof, but the food was delicious, quick, inexpensive, and the service was pleasant and enjoyable. If I'm ever in the neighborhood, I'll definitely be back. It's a Harlem gem."
1019,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,I simply adore this place. I come down here every chance I get all the way from the Bronx. The staff is very friendly and welcoming the food is delicious and the coffee is outstanding and very reasonably priced. I day dream about their waffles lol and there pressed sandwiches always taste fresh and are just as good if not better. Come with your best gal pal or alone with a nice book or the paper sit back and enjoy all this cute little cafe has to offer.
1020,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This place was right next door to our house we rented. It is family owned and run. Good and fast service. Great food. Delicious coffee.  Price was just right.
1021,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"The food is great, the coffee is great, the service is great and the atmosphere is divey hut with a warm cozy feel and great music.After catching a redeye, catching a ride to my friends apartment in Harlem, the last time I ate was over twelve hours and 2600 miles across the country. The kid got a short stack with nutela, my lady got the french toast (loaded) and I got the breakfast platter with plantains (+.50)The 2 most important things, the eggs were truly over medium and the coffee was excellent."
1022,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Great super great people hereAsk about their california campComing back soonestI'm coming back for a Philly cheese steak soonestWesley
1023,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I actually really like the food and coffee there. The staff is really nice as well. But I am so confused as to why they are always closed, especially when their hours online say that they are open. It's hard to be a returning customer when you are constantly getting disappointed. Honestly, it almost seems like the owner sometimes doesn't bother opening up the place. I will not be expecting to go here for my morning coffee anymore."
1024,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"The food was the best I've had in NY and LA breakfast spots. The Belgian waffle with eggs and cheese was warm, cheesy and delicious. The staff was really helpful especially Deborah and Diana. Also their house blend coffee is my favorite. I'd take it over a bougie coffee on time square any day. Highly recommend this place for great service and delicious food."
1025,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Really nice local spot for breakfast or lunch. Good robust coffee to get you going. Small place but easy to get served. From the owner Pat to everyone else, nice people who were helpful and easy to talk to. Good food. Good place to hang."
1026,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Meh. Was randomly closed for several days before I tried it. The food was just okay. The service was just okay. And the conversation I overheard between the people working there was definitely not okay-- I was the sole person sitting in back and I think they forgot I was there. Suffice it to say, I would not recommend this spot to people of color. We can spend our money elsewhere."
1027,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Great place around the neighborhood, I love the ice tea and waffles here. Small place but comfy."
1028,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Nothing but love at the love cafe Always looking out for their students from across the street! & of course their neighborhood people. Always receiving people with a smile! As soon as you step into the café, you could literally feel the love!   *P.S.- Right now, the Cafe is following their summer schedule. 7AM-2:30PM! Stop by to try their yummy meals and coffee! CASH ONLY."
1029,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We can never move. We can't. Jay, the barista and part-owner of the Cafe, knows us not only by sight, but our orders. Every day, I walk in, let him know if I'm just grabbing a latte for my girlfriend or her drink and a mocha for me. She's from Seattle and takes her coffee extremely seriously -- Jay makes it for her perfectly every time.And don't get me started on the food. It's nothing fancy, not in the least. But it's done just right and it's kind of insanely cheap. We've gone in there on a Saturday completely starving and walked away with a $19 bill after eating at least twice as much as we should. Throw in the way that it completely brightens the neighborhood, with their true care for their customers, the way they treat the high school students at the predominantly minority high school like humans, and the owner Pat's clear affection for East Harlem, and you've got a perfect local coffee shop."
1030,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Extremely kind workers, delicious pancakes, and excellent coffee! The price of the ice coffee is extremely cheap for the quality and amount they provide. I would definitely come here again!"
1031,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Lately I've been finding great breakfast spots on Yelp. I wanted to find a place in my area that I could grab something quickly to eat but also have a sit down experience. I grabbed a seat at the back and ordered the breakfast platter with avocado. Everything I had was great and affordable. As I left, I noticed the place was getting crowded by the bar stools in the front. I agree with others when they say it's a hidden gem."
1032,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Went here to grab a bite to eat for lunch after reading about it on Yelp. After perusing the menu, I decided to go with the chicken salad sandwich.Though the sandwich was pretty large and priced pretty well, it left a little to be desired as far as flavor goes and took a while to prepare.Nevertheless, the owner was super friendly and it looks like they have a lot of loyal customers--not a bad spot hidden in East Harlem."
1033,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Went there this morning, pancakes were our main purpose, our goal, that we happily furfilled. Cheap and good quality for breakfast! Nice staff as well!"
1034,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We could have not have chosen a better place to have breakfast. I searched for ""a good breakfast spot in Harlem"" And we picked a good one. Pat, was the best!They sat us pretty quickly in the back where there are a few small tables. Other tables were occupied with some very respectful local high school kids and a few police officers even stopped by for a meal...that's when you know you picked a good spotOur hotel was near Times Square so we traveled a bit to get to The Love Cafe and it was absolutely worth it. I HIGHLY recommend the pancakes and the iced coffee. I'm typically not an iced coffee drinker but it was a hot day and the coffee was top notch!Please visit adorable place if you have a chance you will not regret it."
1035,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"During our weekly Saturday in the city, hubbs and I relied on Yelp for a place with good eats and came across this great hole in the wall, greasy spoon spot. When we arrived, it looked way too small and we thought we would have to order and eat our food in the car but since there were a few officers placing orders, we decided it was worth a try because NYC cops always know where the eating is good. After a few minutes, we were told that there were a few tables in the rear and on our way back there, we noticed that the dining bar in front is actually pretty long so, if there weren't any tables in back, we would have been able to comfortably dine up front. The staff is super friendly. Give them time, they're attentive to everyone. The place can house a lot of folks but there's only two people taking orders and serving tables. The guy serving us saw our preoccupation with our phones and offered up the WiFi password. Very cool. I always enjoy perusing the food pics to help me choose my order. I came across Jay C's waffle sandwich pic and immediately knew that was what I wanted, especially seeing that they have non-pork meats like turkey bacon and beef sausage. I ordered a Turkey Bacon, Egg and Cheese on a Belgian Waffle and it was everything! I asked for some maple syrup to complete the dish. It was amazing. Hubby had a Philly Cheesesteak on a Roll that he liked and I tasted it, of course, to keep my reviews authentic and all; it was good. I wish there was a bit more cheese and the meat, cut a little bigger, but it was real steak and not that steakums crap, which was a pleasant surprise, so they get a check mark for that. Hubby had an Iced tea and I had skinny Chai Latte; I must say that their beverages were on point. The iced tea tasted homemade and the chai was fragrant and tasted great. For as long as my boy will be going to CU every weekend, we will be trying out many places in the area, from the humble luncheonette to the pretentious bistro and everything in between and I'm happy to say that I'm a little bit in love with the Love Café."
1036,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Affordable, great service, yummy breakfast. What more can you ask for? Truly a hidden gem in East Harlem, I hope they expand and continue to flourish as a business. The owner works hard and is really a sweet guy! He remembers his customers names & I think it's very hard to come across businesses that have employees and owners that genuinely CARE about their consumers. Lovely cafe. I will be back!"
1037,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Really good coffee for a great price and a nice cozy atmosphere. Definitely a hole in the wall place though. Cash only!
1038,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Excellent food, very good service, the owners were so nice and hilarious to boot. I cannot imagine getting as good a breakfast anywhere in NY for the very decent price we paid."
1039,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,-Good service-Average Food-Tiny dining area-Good prices-Cash onlyI'd give it 3.5 stars but they get a bump up to 4 for the positive vibes.
1040,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Took an Uber from my hotel to this place at 10:30 am on a Saturday and it was closed. Yelp said it was open. So not happy. Why say it's a ""breakfast "" place when it's not open to serve breakfast?"
1041,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We were in town for governors ball and wanted a cheap place to eat before going into the festival. We found love Cafe on Yelp and went to scope it out. It was amazing! Our food was cheap, my boyfriend and I were incredibly full for only 14 dollars (and we didn't get waters! LOL) Pat knew the name of almost everyone who came in and there were a lot of high school students stopping by. It seems like an amazing local cafe and I hope I can stop in again before I leave the city!"
1042,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"""You want to go where everyone knows your name"" it was such a delight to dine in this local cafe and see customers of all ages flood the counter to place their orders. FYI it's very small and quaint with a boast of personality.I had the Belgian waffle bacon egg and cheese sandwich. What a savory salty but sweet treat. The mocha coffee was delicious....and I don't drink coffee! I will definitely be back to try their other selections including the deserts! I want them to know my name"
1043,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Amazingly friendly ownership. Greeted us, had us seated, and even offered  the wifi password without us having to ask. Food is very affordable which is amazing. Food is nothing out of the ordinary but still good food.Also a PokeStop, so there's that.  Set up a lure and have some pancakes :]"
1044,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"It's weird to me that this place has such high reviews and I guess it's people who know the owners and or live in the neighborhood who give it a five. It's a small shabby place with like 2 wobbly tables in the back, at the end of the railroad hallway type bar. I came with my 2 daughters, and we weren't very comfortable,  but I hoped the food would make up for the lacking ambience...it didn't.  Mediocre coffee and pancakes,  super sweet hot cocoa.  Nothing special,  and needs a renovation."
1045,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This morning the boyfriend and I woke in LA where we now live and got some iced lattes. It got us reminiscing on how no one ever can beat the wonderful deliciousness of a love cafe chai zing, our I'm Saturday morning ritual we miss so much. The love cafe is hands down our favorite neighborhood breakfast spot and we have eaten just about the entire menu! Some highlights:-waffle with the works-chop cheese fries (an East Harlem classic (we always share a plate to start))- quesadillas with pork and avocado - chicken salad sandwich with pesto - pastelitos with their housemade chipotle cheese dipping sauce- the breakfast platter (so good with the tostones)-I could go on and onPat and Jay are a dynamic duo with so many interesting stories. It's obvious the level of commitment they have for the community, keeping the prices fair so the kids at the school across the street can keep coming in. Rick and Amanda love the love cafe!"
1046,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This place is great for breakfast - Had a delicious egg white and cheese sandwich and my friend one upped me with a loaded egg and cheese with extra bacon and avocado which were both devoured.  It's a great grab and go spot with the option to sit at the counter and become fast friends with the owner or in the back by the AC.  So happy to have Love Cafe in my neighborhood!
1047,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,I got the Belgian waffle with the works and a large coffee. Amazing!!! Everyone was so nice and just a good ambiance. Will be back very soon :)!
1048,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Who doesn't love the name??Wonderful service & warm neighborhood vibe!The food is excellent & the menu is sweet & simple!Coffee is excellent!!!!
1049,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"The food is good but the servers are quite unfriendly. I arrived with my partner at 10a and both female servers avoided eye contact.  Then once we got settled at a two top table, the server just walked up to us and asked what we wanted without so much as a smile or hello. Lastly, we had to hunt our server down to pay the bill.  I handed her the bill with the tip money included-- she couldn't even say thanks or ""have a good day."" It was a very unpleasant experience and we won't be back."
1050,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Super! Classic breakfast hitting the spot on all fronts regarding food.This place cooked the turkey bacon crispy just like regular bacon. Thank goodness.
1051,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We randomly found this place for breakfast. The best Belgian waffles and French toast in town!! The coffee is great and they pay very good attention to the customers needs! If you walk in and it's crowded ask if there is room at the back, they have some tables where you can sit and enjoy your breakfast."
1052,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,The $3 egg white wrap was tasty and super affordable. The service was quick. Attended an outside fair and stopped by a few times. Cash only
1053,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Awesome local spot! Perfect cafe con leche and grilled cheese! Homemade brownies! Amazing owner, awesome prices, locally owned!"
1054,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"So unfortunately I didn't get to try their amazing looking food because there was a group of teens talking highly inappropriate in front of my 5 year old child. Then want to say, ""act like she never heard curses before, BYE!"" Now I'm not going to argue with the little girl. I hoped the manager or whoever would of done more about it since they weren't even eating"
1055,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I have only had the hot chocolate here but it so perfectly delicious, that I just had to write about it even if it's just for that. I first learned about this place from a coworker who stopped in to pick up some coffee and breakfast. Since I had already eaten breakfast way earlier and was looking for a warm-me up, I opted to give their hot chocolate a try. It was LOVE at first sip. I returned later that day for another cup of chocolat' which was just as perfectly balance as the first. The hot chocolate was not too sweet and not bland, it was simply perfect. It reminded me of the hot cocoa my mother used to make for my brother and I when we were younger. I would have it everyday if chocolate wasn't at war with the skin on my face ."
1056,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"It's like being in a time warp! Plates, utensils, and food like you're back in the 70s, but in a good way. Oh, and even the music and the laborers at the stools in the front. A classic find. And the owner is a native of the neighborhood!"
1057,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Can't stop thinking about their Cubam sandwich; one of the best that I've had. Pork not dry and the sauce/condiment is to die for; (other Cuban sandwiches that I've had their pork was dry to the point where I wasnt able to scarf down)
1058,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Food is cheap and plentiful. The staff is really very nice. Service is fast.The place is a bit dirty with no soap in the bathroom but if you want some quick pancakes (which were decent) this is your place.
1059,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Love cafe is a nice little spot in East Harlem gotta come by the sandwiches are good the the pancakes are so huge I'm not much of a coffee drinker but the coffee is good. The prices are great The staff & owner are great & very humble. You come few times they will greet you by your name. Eyewitness the school kids about 50 or more come in they greet them by name. Don't call in the morning thry are busy.  write own order the way you like.
1060,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Great breakfast & lunch here. I've had the waffles, egg sandwiches, etc. My husband liked the hotdog and chicken parm sandwich as well, I haven't tried them yet.The waffles are my favorite! Can't beat the vibe and service, Pat, Jay and the whole crew are super welcoming. I love that they know everyone's name when they walk in. A true neighborhood spot... They are closed in the evenings."
1061,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Delicious .......extremely friendly staff.  Made my day!Loved the chocolate cake.Will definitely be back!
1062,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I miss you Love Cafe! This place is like love at first sight. No seriously. I used to come here when I worked in Harlem and it was my favorite thing about that long commute. They close early and should extend their business hours, but the food here is definitely made by people who care about food and their customers. Something that was unsettling--their chicken empanadas are slightly better than mine. They come with a side of chipotle cheese, which is now on my list of favorite sauces. Looks like I'm going back to Harlem."
1063,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This place is awesome...I ordered a sandwich that involved  avocado and when jay( the guy behind the counter) realized they were out he literally ran to the store.
1064,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Great food, great prices, and so many choices of food too! Got the pancakes with 'the works', powdered sugar, whipped cream, caramel sauce, chocolate sauce and cocoa powder..amazing! And loved how the staff was so friendly and remembered so many orders of the regulars, definitely going back"
1065,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"The coffee here is phenominal, I love a good cup of coffee with milk and sugar, they make it strong, sweet and just right. They just gotta make sure they are dependable to be open early in the morning.The bagels are always chewy fresh and pressed with a really cool press that leaves my bagel with nice crispy lines on it, and the bagel is always generously buttered. Im a simple man, and I really don't love mornings, but this cafe always gives me some good luvin in the morning!"
1066,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We are Australians and we're looking for a good coffee and a local feel ......This place is amazing, Pat & Jay we wish we found your cafe sooner. Your food and coffee were great and you two really made us feel good about being there.If you haven't been here you should!!! They will make you feel like a local in no time!Thanks again."
1067,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Went here for lunch with my daughter. Order a salad and it was a amazing my daughter order a Cuban sandwich one of her many favorite foods to eat that was also amazing. We enjoyed ourselves. The guys who work here are great. This is our new spot to enjoy breakfast and lunch.
1068,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This place has the most delicious coffee! Not only is the food and coffee delicious but the people who work there AND the customers are so friendly.
1069,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Love Cafe has the best coffee I have ever had in my 23 years on this Earth! No joke. I walk over from 3rd avenue (sometimes multiple times a day) to grab a small coffee for -get this- $1. Also, the service here is welcoming and personable.There are a few vegetarian options including most of the spot's all-day breakfast items. Gotta admit I have been a little underwhelmed by the two meals I bought here. Egg and cheese was decent, but seemed carelessly thrown together. And the small salad was fresh, but overpriced. I have heard wonderful things from a friend who ordered french toast. And I still have evil anti-veg fantasies about the chopped cheese fries offered here.Heads up, Love Cafe is right across the street from a Middle/ Highschool so lunch hours are usually very crowded."
1070,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Possibly the best breakfast/brunch place in the city. Cozy little space with a great owner and staff. They get the job done but the star here is the food!! The waffles with a side order of chicken fingers is heaven!!! And they dress up all the food at your table. Prices are EXTREMELY affordable but place is cash only. Will be going here many many more times!!
1071,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,This place is small but packed with goodness. I wish they'd take cards. But the staff was friendly and the portions were large. Prices were very reasonable. Would come again when in the big apple again
1072,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"If you want an excellent cup of morning Joe & some delicious morning eatswith some fine tunes emitting from the radio...this place has it all!Great friendly staff and super cheap prices by NYC standards, make the Love Cafea routine stop for me every morning."
1073,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Woohoo! As good as it gets is right. My daughter & I were just in NY for our 1st time. We stopped by the cafe for lunch. She had the burger & fries & I had the chicken quesadilla. Fries were perfectly crispy & the quesadilla was awesome w/ their signature chipotle sauce. We were full but not too full to skip dessert. We ordered the waffles w/ the works - heaven on a plate. It was all so delicious. Still, the service & hospitality the owner embodies is the main reason I'm writing this review. I wish I could have put him in my pocket & brought him back to LA w/ us.Stop by, you won't be disappointed."
1074,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Having been tasked with the job of driving my kids to their weekday & weekend examines at their school, I have found a little haven across the street at this café.Their coffee is very good and for $1 a cup I am happy for a while... especially since there is very little else around the neighborhood at 8am in the morning.I also frequent their orange truck down on Wall St. in the morning;same friendly service and old-fashion rock & roll music."
1075,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Excellent food. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because of very close quarters. But that's expected for New York! Don't be discouraged by the outside. Very warm welcome when walking in the door. Excellent excellent service, very affordable prices. One of the best ice coffees I've had. Get the Belgium waffle! It was delicious! Heads up.. CASH ONLY!"
1076,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"LOOOOOOVE this place.  Super friendly.  Great prices.  Coffeee is f*cking dOpe, and they know it!  They remember your name. House made desserts CRAY! I adore my Grilled Swiss Cheese Croissant with Olive Oil, Tomato and an Arnold Palmer.  Pat's brownie is the trOOf'PLEASE OPEN ON SUNDAY!    I have never been disappointed by this place!  This is the only place in the hood' that I can actually show off to visitors.  Love you LOVE Café..."
1077,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This place is around the corner from me and I try to go probably once a week on average, sometimes less, sometimes more. The crew is super friendly and quick and the food and coffee are good. Pat talks to me like I'm an actual regular even though I don't go anywhere near daily. My go-to's are the chicken quesadilla and the bacon, egg, and cheese croissant (to which I occasionally add syrup for a little sweetness). Sometimes the place is full of teens from the school across the street, but lately I tend to go on Saturdays or around 4PM on weekdays and it's fine. I'm sure it's not too packed at various other times during the day as well. The vibe is generally chill and good though. There's a nook in the back with 4 or 5 small tables if you want to be relatively alone, and then there's a decent amount of bar space in the front. It's one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood. Whereas Brother's Bakery a few blocks away is pricey and feels homogenized and synthetic, Love is affordable, tastier, and feels real and personal."
1078,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"You always feel like it's cheers in this place especially when you walk in and Pat says ""hey you want your usual"". Everything there is made with love and I know because it tastes like it."
1079,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Perfect little place. And great customer service. Down side is that it's right next next to next to a high school so it gets packed but even the high school kids are great.
1080,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"First time at this cafe today.  Worked on wifi, chatted with the owner, had a typical breakfast.  All three were great experiences. Love Cafe is a classic neighborhood coffee shop where everyone is known by name.Quaint scene: boys' card game in a tiny corner...high school kids? Maybe.... Scene outta Good Fellas.  If you're looking for a warm slice of Harlem to go with that Latte, look no further."
1081,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Another local East Harlem gem. Delicious coffee and food. The desserts are especially insane. Awesome owners and staff - Pat and Jay are so welcoming and great to talk to. They are what make Love Cafe so great :) As our the locals who frequent here. Definitely will be back! Gotta try me some of that 7 layer chocolate cake :-P
1082,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This place is the best for breakfast, lunch, or simply a coffee. The prices are better than anywhere else in the area, and it is one of the few places that actually have great coffee, and people serving you your food and drinks exactly how you want it. The place is not decorated in a very attractive way, and it isn't very spacious either. Nevertheless this is a hole in the wall, if you are looking for quality for your dollars. If you are in the area it will be a great choice to stop by."
1083,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,I adore this little Cafe which makes the best coffee and breakfast around! The staff are super friendly and the prices can't be beat!!Try their French Toast with a side of scrambled eggs! Yum! They also have a killer vanilla chai latte!
1084,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This place is great. The food is good, staff is friendly and the prices are crazy low. my boyfriend and I had a meal each, with one latte and one juice and it was 12 bucks! This area doesn't have many spots like it so it's a real gem. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because there were a few little things that I felt could have really made the place more cohesive. such small things but: The ice tea bin was one of those old plastic ones that just is not appealing to look at - why not one of those cute glass ones with the silver lid? the plates were also styrofoam (I believe), but would be better to have some cool different style and pattern plates etc. Really not one to be picky, but as great as this place is, those tiny little things would make it that much better!"
1085,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Beef & chicken empanadas cooked to perfection with a delicious chipotle cheese sauce. I also recommend the g rilled chicken cesar salad & the Cuban sandwich. LOVE love Cafe!
1086,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Dayum! Here we go again. 1rst day back and this spot once again managed to mess up. I was the only one in the place yet The barista had to take my order w she walked in from outside. Waited and waited for my simple order - then HS students flooded the place to have their orders served prior to mine. Thank you barista! Trying to practice patience this year But this is the last time I give this spot business.
1087,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,The guy behind the counter is extremely rude! He also got the simplest order mixed up. Will never give this spot my business.  he's too used to dealing w HS students from across the street.4/20/15Ok so today My experience was different. The same guy was mega pleasant and my breakfast was everything. Simple! Thank u!!!
1088,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,The guy behind the counter is extremely rude! He also got the simplest order mixed up. Will never give this spot my business.  he's too used to dealing w HS students from across the street.
1089,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"We were staying at an airbandb in East Harlem and found breakfast possibilities limited until we uncovered Love Cafe on Yelp.  This a classic NY neighborhood ""diner,"" ""lunch counter"" etc. Food is very good and well priced but the exceptional quality that it has is PERSONALITY.  The boss (Pat) is interested in his customers (old-timers  or newcomers) and his staff have the same attitude.  They know everyone who comes in, and they'll know you the second time you're there!!  Sit at the counter (not in the back) and allow yourself enough time to get into the conversation (don't eat and run).  Wish we'd found this place when we first arrived instead of just before our departure.Jim and Carolyn from Kirkland, WA"
1090,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"The  Love Cafe is a wonderful addition to the community.  I worked on a NYC signal engineering project this week and was welcomed by Pat the owner to stop in.  Well - I was blown away with the supreme level of customer care and ease of order processing.  I ordered a chicken salad and that was theee best salad I have had on history.  Outstanding, delicious, and just enough..... Will return.  Thanks Love Cafe."
1091,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Decent meal for the price. Nothing to write home about.  The service was sub par. Good for a solo mission
1092,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Best service! Best coffee!! You don't get a better deal and there's nothing in the neighborhood like this. So cute and friendly and quick! Vanilla chai latte and waffles are amazing!!!! They also make their own coffee blend. See you there!!!
1093,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,So happy that I discovered this cafe! Strong coffee that tastes good for $2!! Restaurant quality French toast and pancakes for $5 each! Friendly service. This place is a serious gem in East Harlem! It is my new takeout brunch spot. Highly recommend.
1094,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Quite simply the best Iced Coffee in East Harlem and for that fact, my go-to Saturday morning spot. The service is consistently excellent, the owner is always ready with a joke or entertaining anecdote makes you want to share something too makes for a great experience, neighborhood diner feel which I've seen written here before."
1095,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Service was great! Food was excellently priced for the size!  Asked us if we needed wifi, took our order and food came out quickly. Everything was delicious, and our server (might've been the owner?) gave us tons of good advice on things to see around NY. Wish we could've gone back!"
1096,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"After my initial visit I can proudly say that I am now a regular at Love Cafe. There is no greater feeling than being able to walk in and have them hand me my usual without more than a Good Morning.  I am absolutely convinced that they serve The Best Coffee in the five boroughs and the addictive nature of the brownies are cemented by the fact that they are sold out of them by early afternoon everyday.Today I had the pleasure of a chicken salad sandwich on a roll and it was heavenly! Huge chunks of chicken, just the right about of dressing, fresh lettuce, tomato, provolone...HEAVENLY! I'm a big proponent of supporting local businesses but people need to travel as far as they need to to get to Love Cafe! They will win you over with their hospitality, food, drinks, and atmosphere."
1097,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I came across Love Cafe after a fun morning with my daughter at Jefferson Park Playground.  From the moment I walked in the door to the time I left, I received nothing but smiles, great service and wonderful food. I will be back for the coffee, soft serve, and can't wait to try the sandwiches.  Thanks for the love, Love Cafe!"
1098,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"What a hidden gem! The French toast is absolutely wonderful! The meals are big, and cheap. It is very busy, and rightfully so! It is a typically diner, and very busy with not a lot of room to eat. It's bush and upbeat and the staff is very kind!"
1099,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I have finally found a place that makes decent coffee in East Harlem. After reading the positive reviews on Yelp I thought to finally give it try. And it definitely did not disappoint. I had the cappuccino and my boyfriend had and ice mocha, both were perfect.Look forward to trying their food next time. Which will be soon."
1100,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Great small place owned and operated by a longtime resident. Owner and manager know everyone's name. Superb lattes at great prices.Have the Belgian waffles with nutella if you have time to sit for breakfast. AMAZING! There's butter in every bite.  Gets crowded with students, as there's a school across the street. Seating can be a challenge during those busy times. Very much worth the wait for a seat if you're not in a hurry.Old school charm and generous portions."
1101,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Stopped in at this gem after a recruitment fair at the nearby school. Such a nice place with a lot of heart, staff is super friendly and warm."
1102,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I go to this place almost everyday.  Product: Great coffee, fresh baked goods, house-made sauces, house-cured deli meatsService: Three extremely personable and prompt persons - I've never been disappointed.  They steam the milk before they add it to your $1 drip!   Value: $5 lunch special $1 drip $1.75 toasted muffin with butter Atmosphere: Deeecent - they always play KEXP in the mornings, which is a great indie rock station out of Seattle"
1103,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Amazing Belgian waffles. The bacon cheese fries and lattes are great. Also their lemonade isn't too sweet and not too sour, it's perfect. All for a great price."
1104,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Hidden gem! Super friendly staff and amazing value for your money. We will definitely become regulars!  So awesome to find such a great neighborhood place!  Stop by even if you don't live in the area.
1105,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I took a star off because they close at 430PM!!!  I want you to be open for longer hours!!!Anyway, the coffee is excellent, and so are the baked goods.  It's really great to be close to a nice cafe in New York that has free wifi and isn't super packed and has reasonably priced and delicious things to eat/drink (mega run-on sentence, I know)."
1106,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I'm visiting from California my mother and I have breakfast here like 3 times a week.  The waffles are delicious,  homemade batter. Mom and pop place, what I love about New York.  Pat is a sweetheart he's attentive and humble.  The service is great."
1107,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Had a great, cheap breakfast (egg and cheese sandwich and coffee) here today en route to shopping at the riverfront complex nearby. Love Cafe had a classic no-frills menu, low prices and an A grade from the health department: winning on all counts!The sandwich and coffees were a bit on the small side, but as the prices were too I didn't really mind. The food tasted good, though it was bit greasy (which I suppose comes with the diner-grill territory).I chatted with the owner a bit as I paid, and he was a very friendly guy who offered me some insights about the neighborhood. He also described East Harlem as being ""the real New York,"" and his small shop's casual intimacy and rough charm seemed to meet that description.Eager to try some other menu items here on a future visit. Had a great experience today, will definitely be back!"
1108,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Love Cafe is adorable. The service is exceptional and the food choices are priced very well! Together, we ordered pancakes, a Belgian waffle, and two chai lattes and the total was under $20! Aside from the price, the owner was sweet and made sure we had everything we needed. Definitely stop in for a coffee or a full meal!"
1109,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"This place is very cute and I'd love to come by more often but it's closed a lot. Went in this morning but it took 5 mins to get any service because the coffee guy kept chatting it up with a regular. My mocha drip was warm, not hot, so 10 mins later it was a little too cold for me to finish. I heard good things about the brownie so i have to try it. This cafe is cute and lovely and quiet. I see myself stopping by more often."
1110,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,It was my first order tonight and everything is absolutely delicious and fresh. The people working there are so nice and warm and welcoming. Loving it!
1111,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"A true neighborhood spot - very reasonable prices, super friendly owner and staff, delicious menu (especially the chicken salad sandwiches), and very caring toward the kids from high school across the street."
1112,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Awesome group of gents that work here as well as their regulars! Food is delicious but the coffee is even better! Small friendly neighborhood cafe is now going to be my weekly stop
1113,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Living in the area for a few years, this is my go to Coffee place! ICE COFFEE all year round, hate when they are closed. This is the perfect local coffee spot (keep in mind not a sit and chill spot except on the wknds too many HS kids in/out)"
1114,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I went here this morning with my boyfriend and loved every single bite we had. We found this gem through yelp, and the great reviews did not disappoint. Once we entered, the staff was very welcoming. I got the chicken salad croissant sandwich with avocado and my boyfriend got a Belgian waffle sandwich with eggs and cheese. Both dishes were amazing. Not being a an ice chi latte fan, I was impressed when I tried theirs, best I've ever had, it was just the right amount of sweet. Definitely coming back again! :)"
1115,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"I went here with a super large group and everyone was so helpful and accommodating. We were looking for an actually affordable breakfast place and we found it! So much bang for you buck. Large portions, quick service, relaxed atmosphere. Pat is the best!!! Also cash only."
1116,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,My large group of friends and I came here while on vacation. This was some of the best service we had in New York! It's cash only and the best prices in the area. Amazing drip coffee!! I got a breakfast bagel sandwich and my two vegan friends had options on the menu.Ask for Pat!!
1117,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,Belgian waffle is great. Soothing music while you eat. Love cafe  has an incredible menu too.
1118,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Awesome little place where the owner greets guests, takes orders, and prepares dishes! It's the kind of place where you can see folks from the neighborhood and people are greeted by name. I'll definitely be back!"
1119,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"There is nothing better for breakfast or lunch. The food is quality, and combined with the vibe, this place cannot be beat. Pat and Jay are the best!"
1120,R1X1PY1SSCKyFZI6CWJgmA,"Lovin da love. Bring your cash and coffee lovin friends. Pat is the best, I love you pat!"
1121,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is a niche place in this neighborhood where the closest restaurant that you can see from its windows is called ""chicken and burger"". No this is no chicken or burger, this is quality Japanese food sourced specially by the owner and made with love. I love eating food made with care.The restaurant itself is a very intimate experience so if you don't like lots of people that may be good but also you may be sitting pretty close to someone at the long table they have. The couch seating is pretty comfy. The music always sets a certain mood...I think there is a Sade pic in the washroom.The food is really the star here. It's fresh, clean tasting, and flavorful without being too extra (those sushi places that make rolls so big and crammed with stuff this is NOT). I had a really good spicy tuna don bowl the last time I went. I've tried the onigiri which is decent. I'm also a big fan of mochidoki and they serve these for dessert.You are going to pay typical NYC prices for Japanese food (not high end elite but not cheap-o) but it's worth the experience."
1122,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Cute little Japanese restaurant in Harlem!  We had the salmon avocado over rice and the  fried salmon skin over rice.  I recommend both.  There aren't a lot of options in Harlem for great Japanese comfort food and we are glad we found this little nook.  The crab kani salad was also refreshing.  The wait staff is super attentive!  Although, be mindful that the Japanese portions are a bit small and we were hungry that night!"
1123,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Hard to find homemade Japanese foods that is not quite sushi bars but she has a bit of everything but details in quality and the taste of authentic Japanese comfort foods. I'm particularly like Chirashi,  Macha cheese cake, and red ginger drinks.  I can't get enough of her delicious  pickled ginger. I was just here last night!, here I m again but expected a long waiting. That's what good foods is all about !. O' e' Shi..."
1124,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"An artsy and high quality meal at a premium. The moment you enter this cozy restaurant you feel transported into a peaceful space. The bench tables with upholstered benches on either side are very hip and welcoming at the same time. I could see myself spending an afternoon here reading a book, sipping tea, and munching on their mochi ice cream. Our favorites of the evening were- the vanilla chip mochi ice cream with delightfully thin skin- matcha cheesecake - nice texture, not really sweet, but you can taste the matcha and the slight tart flavor. Not really a kid dessert.- eel in the unagi appetizer- the broth in the chicken ramen- daikon Ume - very strong in flavor and a dish you can't get in a lot of places- the sauce that came with the sushi rolls.Just so-so were- the sushi rolls (ikura was not as full or fresh as we would want and the baked salmon roll kind of fell apart)- the prices! Our bill for a medium amount of food for 3-4 people was $90 before tip."
1125,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Chopped Parsley is a delicious and cozy Japanese restaurant in the area. Service was efficient and friendly.  The server even gave me a free mochi, because she accidentally gave me a sushi roll rather than ""taco-style"" sushi which I had asked for (I truly didn't mind the mistake, at all, but was grateful for the mini dessert).The ambiance is cozy and relaxed.  They have R&B and hip hop playing. There are pictures of celebrities like Sade on the wall, and other musicians and singers.  I tried the cooked tuna tekkadon and thought it was super tasty.  I also got a spicy salmon roll on the side. It too was good, though sushi doesn't seem to be the star of Chopped Parsley's show.  Their menu seems to roughly be 75% cooked items, with the remaining 25% sushi.  Next time I come I'll probably stick with all cooked items.  I had a Japanese Orion beer with my meal, too.  In total, with a beer, an appetizer (sushi) and a main, I left full and paid something like $40 for a feast.  Anyway, I loved my meal here and will definitely be back."
1126,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Some of the best food in the area. Absolutely delicious Japanese comfort food and really fresh sushi. It's a small little place, and the kitchen is small so you may need to be patient at times but it is worth the wait, truly one of my favorite spots to go. The service is wonderful too - I feel like I'm in the company of friends whenever I eat there! Thank you for such a gem!"
1127,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Fun and relaxed vibe, delicious food. The salmon sashimi was overpriced and the chicken curry felt a little out of place on the menu, but overall a great experience."
1128,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Really happy this spot lives in Harlem! Cozy little restaurant with delicious food and bomb music. I came here with my mom and four friends and they were really accommodating. I'd love to come back for a date night!
1129,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I don't want this review to sound wrong, so please read with a gentle tone.I visit in the Heights on weekends, and since I decided to bring my dog I called and ordered ahead for pick up.The woman/owner took my order and said 20 min. When I arrived, she was in the middle of my order no big deal. I waited outside with my dog and chatted with strangers walking by.While the food was all very good in flavor, and I do recommend this restaurant to those with time to spare, but I just felt uncomfortable. The owner was overwhelmed with her orders, and having only one employee which she talks down to was not cool. I believe in treating your employees the way you treat your guests.There is no kitchen, the restaurant is the size of my living room, with a corner designated to food preparation on several hot plates and mini oven/toaster. Again, food was good, but the experience was just ehhh."
1130,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Chopped Parsley is my and my wife's go to place in our Hamilton Heights neighborhood. We like the cosy atmosphere, we feel at home at Chopped Parsley. The food is reliably good, my favorite is the chicken udon and my wife loves the Maze Gohan made with cooked smoked salmon, pickles and rice. That's alway a pleasant experience."
1131,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My bill came to $17.95 before tip, for a very small bowl of mixed rice. No drinks, just this. With $12 poke everywhere with much larger portions and more ingredients (not to mention you can get a authentic rice bowl midtown at stops like domburi-ya for $13~15), and all kinds of delicious ethic food available for under $10 in the neighborhood this just doesn't add up I broke the budget and left hungry. Won't be going back."
1132,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Really cool little restaurant with incredibly fresh and delicious food.  Hidden gem of Hamilton Heights for sure!
1133,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is probably the best Japanese restaurant in the area. The atmosphere is intimate and cozy and The staff was really nice and kind with me throughout the whole meal. I can only speak for their curry soba noodles but I can say that they were amazing, probably the best I have had throughout my time in the United States. The noodles had a great taste without being too intense and the chicken was also well cooked and flavorful. I will be definitely coming back."
1134,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is a cozy restaurant hidden in the residential streets of Hamilton Height. There were two large tables to sit comfortably for eating and two set of bench table/lounge area that appears more suitable for sitting back and having a drink. They have happy hour from I believe 6 to 7pm everyday? Food was really good and authentic and service was excellent. They made sure we had everything we need and was available to answer questions. The one star out was because the portion size is much smaller and for a much higher price. I understand that it's uptown, but this is compared to restaurants in the same area. But maybe maybe, I'll check it out during Happy Hour."
1135,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Food was good and clean. Service was splendid. And the matcha cheesecake was to die for! I highly recommend for people going for dates or to hang out~I came on a cold night with a date. I ordered a hot udon with chicken. It hit the spot. All in all, the food came on time and we left full :)"
1136,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Delicious Japanese food in Harlem! Wine happy hour, very friendly stuff and vegan and vegetarian option ;) nice atmosphere as well, very charming."
1137,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My favorite restaurant on the island of Manhattan. This hidden gem makes me so happy every single time we come. She accommodates my celiac disease by making sure the ramen is gluten free (she gives me sushi rice instead of noodles and everything is made with gf soy sauce, Tamari). The sushi is excellent and the atmosphere is so fun. We have eaten here so many times and will continue to. THE BEST OF THE BEST."
1138,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Never knew this place existed but it's been here for 3 years! Super yummy and super fast service. I had the mackerel roll, caviar hand roll, chicken ramen and maze go-Han. Everything was amazing but what was the best was the matcha cheesecake. I'll definitely be coming back."
1139,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Excellent food, Shoshi rolls (salmon & tuna) were amazing.Service was very slow even the restaurant was not over packed.The owner (which is the chef) came to apologize."
1140,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I was really disappointed in this place. The service was absurdly slow; the two women behind the counter were so frantic that they didn't even smile at any customers. The place was really not even that busy.  The place was intimate and I felt that I was in someone's home, which I liked; two stars for that.The sushi was mediocre and overpriced; nothing worth waiting for. I also sat at a poorly designed bench in which I had to bend over to eat. Ridiculous. The rolls were tiny. You'd be better off going to your local supermarket for some sushi!  Really annoyed that I spent my hard earned money here.  I left unhappy.  Would not return."
1141,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Nice restaurant service and food were great.  The place is small very enjoyable for us when we went as it was not crowded.
1142,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"We've been here a few more times since our first visit, and we are glad to see this place doing well with the locals. Coming here on a busy night will leave you waiting for awhile - with all tables full, we waited half hour (or more) between dishes - leaving us wondering if we should just leave, because they were clearly overwhelmed, and we had been sitting there for a couple hours at that point. Just seems like kitchen should staff up more on busier nights. The food is still good, though they've done away with our favorite mackerel. We enjoy the eel rolls and the donburi bowls. I'd say skip the udon bowls because they aren't particularly notable or tasty, and opt for more of their other sushi type dishes. We haven't returned again since the last visit which left us a bit exhausted from waiting, but if you visit them on a less-peak night, your experience should be much better!"
1143,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"So delightful!! From the cutie name to the cozy interior, Chopped Parsley is my absolute new favorite addition to the neighborhood. I love the narrow wooden table by the window, long and skinny, you just want to curl up on the cushiony couch and sip on hojicha.From the specials page: the packed mackerel was my favorite, impeccable squares of oily mackerel atop delicious sushi rice. The ikura dish is a salmon roe-lover's dream, basically an open faced taco of sushi, roe, wasabi and a tiny caper - pops of happiness. the grilled salmon bowl is a generous serving of sushi rice, lots of tasty bits of salmon and pickled vegetables - light and lovely. We just ate mouthfuls of that between the other dishes - a good little filler plate.The eel avocado roll was excellent, you could actually taste the eel, and the grilled spicy tuna roll featured grilled tuna in the middle and a heavy drizzle of spicy sauce on top - and the sauce actually had a good bit of heat! If only they had lunch (and delivery!), and this place could potentially be pretty dangerous!"
1144,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,This place is near my dad's and I have been dying to try for a while.  I went in on a Friday around 6:30pm and ordered pick-up.  Ambiance: Place was pretty empty when I went in but by the time I returned to pick up the food (7:00pm) it was pretty packed.  Place is small and cute. The kitchen is right behind the counter which makes me wonder if the place gets really hot.Service: Waitress was friendly.Food: Ordered the chicken soba noodles as well as the salmon skin dish.  Both dishes were tasty but portion was quite small for the price.I would not object to returning and trying some of their other dishes if already in the area.
1145,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"For more serious sushi lovers this is the go to spot in the neighborhood. Fish is always super fresh and their rolls are delicious. One of my favorite dishes is not sushi tho - their Udon Noodles are amazing. They have a great happy hour deal, especially if you dig Japanese beer like Hitachino which is hard to find, and usually overpriced. I would give 5 stars but they don't deliver, pick up only, and it's hard to know what's on their most current menu outside of Facebook."
1146,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Stellar service, super attentive. Support this small business. Best sushi hands down, every single roll. Spicy Kani is top notch nothing compares. Food is always clean and fresh. Great wine and beer selection to accompany your meal."
1147,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This, my friends, is what they refer to as a ""neighborhood gem"". Amazing sushi at awesome prices; my friend and I split one of the $20ish combos and it was definitely enough. Also had a Japanese iced coffee, and tried the hot coffee. Both were great - not too sweet. Friendly guys running the place and the ambience is lovey. Excellent addition to the area!Edit 4/2017: The sushi is still so excellent, but service is SUPER slow. My most recent visit here took hours and I try to give mom and pop places like this the benefit of the doubt, but the meal was really not paced well at all and we were starving. A shame because the food really is awesome, but it was an unpleasant experience."
1148,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I had somewhat of an unpleasant experience at Chopped Parsley recently, which is sad because I like this place a lot! Comfortable atmosphere and extremely pleasant waitstaff (Parsley is such a sweetheart). But tonight was upsetting- our wait for the main dishes was over an hour long, and didn't exactly fill us up (especially considering some of the prices). All in all, the staff is pleasant and it's a nice place, but I would definitely have liked a heads up if the wait was going to be over an hour."
1149,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Venue: (2/3) laid back and casual. This venue has a neighborhood feel.  Food: (2/5) I ordered the salmon sushi don.  It had salmon, avocado and ikura on a warm bed of sushi.  At 15+ dollars it was overpriced.  I've gotten much better at most places in NYC.  Service (4/5) waiter was nice and attentiveUnsure with the pricing and the mediocre sushi."
1150,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Really nice place in Hamilton Heights :) the sushi I had was super good but it was not a lot so maybe you should get something else as well if you're super hungry. I liked the atmosphere at the place.
1151,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Planning a trip to Harlem? If you aren't then still put Chopped Parsley on your to do list! This spot is a welcomed neighbor and addition Hamilton Heights. As the food options continue to grow uptown, unfortunately the range of options really had not. Then there's Chopped Parsley. My spouse and I had a spontaneous date night and wanted to stay VERY local. I've been wanting to try this gem since it appeared; almost 2 years ago now! The food is so authentically curated. We had shumai, spicy crab roll, cooked salmon roll and of course the green tea cheesecake. Go for the food, stay and chat with owner Parsley. You will not STOP laughing.  Be sure to tell ask her to tell you the ""shake the gate"" story. This story is a part of Harlem's history you will not get on any tour!"
1152,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Sweet little sushi find. So perfect for light dinner with exquisite dessert. I love the Asian folk decor. The owner is a wonderful Japanese woman who took great care with us. Eat the matcha cheesecake!
1153,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"3.5 rounded up to 4.I was pleasantly surprised by Chopped Parsley on Amsterdam and 146th.. From outside, you really can't tell what its all about. On the inside, however, is a tiny mom and pop place serving up some intricately prepared Japanese dishes, teas, and (of course) alcohol.The feel of the place is good - very homey and comfortable. They also have good ventilation, which is necessary because food is prepared within the tiny dining area. We had some of the dons (small rice bowls with fish) and enjoyed them although we were hoping for slightly larger portions for the price. The quality of the fish, however, seemed to be good. The salmon skin was also crisp and tasty.I'd recommend giving the place a try if you were in the area."
1154,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My friend and I had amazing experience at Chopped Parsley! This is family business. The owner himself served the food for us. The food is amazing, all ingredients are fresh. I highly recommend you to try their curry, it's new on their menu)"
1155,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My boyfriend and I heard about this restaurant, which is located in a favorite neighborhood of ours. We knew we had to try it and I'm so glad we did! Food was delicious and the small, cozy space coupled with very personal, caring service was refreshing. If you like curry, please try the curry chicken and curry udon. Super delicious! They also had a mochi special which made me realize the crappy quality of other mochi I've had in the past. Well done, Chopped Parsley!"
1156,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Wow! This mom n pop sushi spot is a hidden gem in Harlem!! Not only is ALL their food made fresh w/delicious ingredients they also have HH 4-7pm all Wine/Beers are only $6!! What's not to love! The owner is a wonderful chef, very accommodating and the 90's throw back music that was bumping made the sushi experience all that more enjoyable. I wish I didn't live soo far uptown or I'd be at this place everyday. Really recommend the vegan udon noodle soup OMG you're tastes buds have NEVER had a broth this good!! Sorry geisha get your shizzle together cause this place will run you out of business"
1157,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Went here because by daughter's bf had been here and diff to find decent sushi in their hood.Very small east village feel.. staff of 3..everything made to order with super fresh ingredients. Innovative and unusual dishes. Had taco rolls and sashimi over rice..fish exceptionally fresh.. tea delish!! Parsley, owner and chef delightful and plays great r&b.. Hidecki the server was very friendly and accommodating."
1158,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"No waste!The owner ,Parsley , yeah that's her nick name, she is such a cool lady. It's a mellow ambiance with nice selection of sake and other drinks. I will totally come back."
1159,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"No waste!The owner ,Parsley , yeah that's her nick name, she is such a cool lady. It's a mellow ambiance with nice selection of sake and other drinks. I will totally come back."
1160,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Honest amazing home-style cooking. Great music. Friendly staff. #1 neighborhood find so far #sugarhill
1161,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,I was just there to pick up some food and was standing to make my order...she didn't say hi or anything and ignored me the whole time...there was only another table with costumers and none of the workers said hi !!! Will not ever return !!!
1162,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My visit to parsley was bitter-sweet. Mid range sushi is dangerous territory if not made into a fancy roll (mayo, mango, salmon roe, avocado, terriyaki glaze, etc.)Review in brief: Only come if youre specifically looking for something novel and simtaneously japanese. Dish quality varied between good and really awkward. Stay away from the salads, in terms of flavor they lack sophistication and forethought. The sushi roll was ok, but there was no thought given to serving temperature. Sushi rice was warm, and this compromised the dish. Quite pricey when considering the quantities served. Dining alone i ordered the following:1 shime saba1 seared salmon arugula and pear salad1 yellowtail scallion rollThe meal started strong with the shime saba, a take on the traditional preparation of vinegar marinated mackerel, albeit with a brilliant twist. Often sashimi is served atop fresh shaved strands of radish or seasonal root crop. At chopped parsley the mackerel was accompanied by julienned cucumber and sprigs of rocket arugula. I found the combination brilliant. The salty flavor of mackerel is permeated with the tang of vinegar, (traditional up to this point) but the bitter flavor of arugula cuts that intensity, allowing you to better taste both aspects of the dish, namely the mackerel and arugula. If i were to criticize the dish, i would say that the fish used is middle grade, and in sashimi the quality and freshness of the fish used is quite apparent to the diner. This is evident in the lack oiliness of the fish.For those who can appreciate mackerel, i would confidently recommend the shime saba.Dish price: fairDish flavor: greatDish quality: fairThe next course was the salad with seared salmon, walnuts and pears. This was not a good dish. Do not order this dish.To begin with, seared means that it is cooked on both sides at a high enough temperature to form a crust but for a short enough amount of time that the center remains at least slightly rare. The salmon served on this dish achieves neither simply because it is too thinly sliced to sear. From a technical standpoint, a slice of fish this thin simply CANNOT be seared.The dressing used on the salad does nothing to marry the greens and the protein. It is far too acidic for the light flavors employed in this dish.The pears feel like something thrown on to make the dish seem avante garde. Completely untreated pears in a salad. Not smoked, not sous vide, not even caramelized. This is 2016, most people are saavy enough to see through gimmicks like this.The walnuts were walnuts. Maybe try caramelizing them, or something. Literally felt like someome took a fistfull of walnuts straight out of a bag and sprinkled them on.I am very very upset by this dish. DO NOT waste cash on this thoughtless clashing salad. WORST.Dish price: attrocious. At 9 usd i expect a lot more.Dish flavor: attrocious. Greens and protein dont work well together. Dressing clashes with all the flavors on the plate in a bad bad way. And the salmon was not seared. Dont say seared if you dont mean seared.Dish quality: attrocious. Each individual element was so sorely lacking in any sort of preparation its hard to imagine that i payed 9 bucks for that....woosahI ended with a simple hamachi scallion roll. Thankfully the flavors were clean and on point. Delicious with or without soy sauce and wasabi, and pretty refreshing thanks to the green spiciness of tbe scallions.My only problem was that my roll was falling apart. With only 3 ingedients, and a radius of 1/2 inch it makes one wonder whether the chef has learned to properly roll sushi.Dish price: fair. But close to poor. At 9 usd for a 6 piece roll with diameter at less than an inch, i felt my heart sink a little when i saw the plate coming.Dish flavor: great! Clean and refreshing, and an excellent way to end a meal.Dish quality: poor. Sushi rolls shouldnt come undone at a sushi bar. This isnt a buffet, and thusly yhe public expects a certain floor level of quality in craft.This is more of an argument on principle, but the entire thing feels very amateur, so much so that it feels like the kitchen staff is learning the ropes on my dime. Amateur japanese fusion at about 30 usd per person. Its not cheap, and as a diner in a city with so many other value filled options, i cant imagine i would have a meal here again soon."
1163,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My friend and I came to Chopped Parsley on a rainy November night, and it was everything we could have asked for and more. I know that sounds cliche, but it's true!My friend and I split a number of apps - salmon ceviche, shrimp shumai, and shi-me saba (cured and vinegared mackeral). My friend is not a fan of salmon, and she loved the salmon ceviche! Each dish tasted so clean and flavorful. The presentation of each dish was also simple and appetizing. The kale, avocado, and seared beef salad was also very tasty, as well as the kani sal roll. Again, these dishes were simple and to the point delicious!We finished our meal with the kasutera with sweet bean and mascarpone cheese. This dessert had just enough sweetness. We chatted with the owner during dessert, and she explained how all the food she makes at her restaurant is something she would eat. That means a lot, especially if you're a health conscious eater. My friend and I left there full and satisfied. We were sad that the meal was over.Other than the food, the place itself was adorable - only a few seats with great decor and enjoyable music. Can't wait to go back there again!"
1164,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Wonderful, filling soups, especially the Japanese style udon curry. Great sushi. Low key, very pleasant service and a great neighborhood place. I highly recommend this lovely little cafe."
1165,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Delicious meal--very fresh and very friendly staff. Absolutely overall delightful dinner experience with a cozy ambiance. 10/10 highly recommend!
1166,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Nice place, friendly staff, very intimate for a nice date or conversation with close friend. Small staff, looks like family run but got food to us in a timely fashion."
1167,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Cute concept, story etc. Felt like I was at a friend's house and they cooked for me... in other words, while tasty and thoughtfully prepared, the food food quality/presentation didn't feel professional. Loosely wrapped sushi, served lukewarm(?)... I've had better sushi at Duane Reade, frankly. Service was cheerful, but dishes brought out in random order at 20 min. intervals made you notice and fully contemplate the horribly uncomfortable seating. Bench and table are at the same height, so get ready for lower back pain that will last a couple days. I wish the owner well, but she had better up her game to compete in NYC. You can get much better Japanese food in Harlem."
1168,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Guys like omg! Ok so they do not have a big selection, I wanted veggie rolls and they didn't  have regular tuna rolls only spicy tuna but I had Salman avocado and cucumber rolls with miso soup and shumai(shrimp dumplins). Everything was so fresh that it was a perfect temperature and was soft , great texture. The miso soup did not have tofu in it but it did have seaweed with vegetables we also has smoked salmon with cucumber roll that tasted like lox and a bagel. The Kochi ice cream was the best ever! U can tell it was really and perfectly made. The one missing start is for the not so big selection. Waiter was great. Thanx Chopped parsley. Just get some regular tuna mad some tofu and we good!"
1169,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,THE BEST. A hole in the wall where Harlem locals can find Japanese cuisine while still feeling at home. Parsley's playlist is everything and she is a warm and welcoming person. The food is also amazing so you really get a complete package of satisfaction.
1170,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I love this little place with all my heart. It's my go-to for comfort food, date night, and meeting up with a friend. The food is delicious and happy hour is a great deal. Parsley, the owner, is so sweet and a brilliant chef. I always leave full and happy and promising to come back soon.I've loved everything I've ordered here, but one of my favorites is the curry soba soup. Also try the matcha cheesecake. It. Is. Bomb."
1171,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Fresh atmosphere, food and vibes. I recommend the Salmon poke appetizer! Cute little date spot."
1172,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I super super super loved the ambiance of this pint-sized Japanese cafe. The set-up of the tables and the photographs on the walls transported me to some chill cafe in the countryside of Japan. Instead, however, I was actually in a nook and cranny of Washington Heights- far from the cries of Japan. The cafe is definitely a nice place for a lover of hipster things, with tables that are uniquely small and shaped just for a rectangular plate of sushi or small bowls of other sorts. I had the Chicken Udon, which I highly enjoyed, with the chicken perfectly cooked in a clear broth. For the price, however, I do think that sizes of the portions could be larger, considering that the sizes of the portions could not feed actual grown men. However, I am a fan, and will come back here next time for some sushi."
1173,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Quality for a great price. Fresh ingredients made in a small kitchen. The restaurant has a homey feel and the food is healthy yet indulgent. Definitely a place you can come to regularly and eat all your meals. Best kept secret in Harlem. Steak sushi is amazing, onigiri is fresh made and delicious (makes you want to cry) and udon is always on point (and served in a huge bowl that makes it taste even better). Prices range from 5-15 ish. Well worth it if you're looking for quality at a great price."
1174,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"One of the best restaurants in the area. Love their soups, even more so their newer curry chicken udon (just the right amount of spicy)! Their menu is pretty unique, offering items that are not usually found in other Japanese restaurant, especially in the neighborhood. The space is cozy and the service has always been very friendly. Definitely one of the gems in Hamilton Heights!"
1175,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Mixed feels on this one. This is the second time I've come here, and the first time it was too full for us to sit; the server was pretty honest about the kitchen being slow when it's full, which we appreciated. Anyway, so it was less full today, and I came with a friend to grab coffee and food. Having read other reviews that complain of slow service, I ordered an iced mocha, shrimp shumai, and a salmon roll. The iced mocha came almost immediately, and I really enjoyed the flavor (I'm not a coffee buff or anything). The shumai came shortly after, and though it was certainly overpriced for the portion ($6 for 6), it was very tasty and light. We were told that the rice cooker had to be refilled for our sushi, and they gave us edamame on the house, which we appreciated. That being said, I don't think I can really recommend the sushi here; it's sort of loosely rolled or lumpy, and all in all doesn't taste better than supermarket sushi and costs more. We waited something like 45 minutes between appetizer and the two sushi rolls we ordered. Anyway, cute date spot, dunno if I'd get the sushi again tho. 3.5/5."
1176,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Something different for the denizens of Sugar Hill - a quaint Japanese cafe that fires a little bit of everything, from hot macha to sushi rolls to edamame to sake.The proprietor, a cheerful ba-san of the Osaka school of hospitality, we'll make suggestions and provide attentive service. The kitchen sits across from the entrance in plain view, so you'll see your food prepared in real time. They've made creative use of the small space (reminiscent of similar eateries in Tokyo) by employing benches and narrow low tables along one of the walls of the shop. Be warned: these tables are very narrow and a bit far from the fixed benches, so watch your napkins and utensils to avoid soiling your shoes or clothes.Try their udon or soba noodle soups, especially in fall and winter. The wine and beer list offers appropriate imports for your consideration, including some unknowns you'll want to try."
1177,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This place is a gem. It doesn't feel like a cookie cutter sushi place, either in design or menu.Really yummy, fresh affordable fare. And they have good big soups (one even had not n meat broth) if you're not in the mood for sushi."
1178,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Super cute, cozy little place that reminded me of a cute cafe in Japan with a homey feeling.  Will be coming back soon!"
1179,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I always have respect when it comes to Japanese- owned sushi places, whether they are small neighborhood joints or Michelin-rated operations. I ordered a Salmon Don with ikura hoping their food lived up to the yelp reviews. Sadly ikura was fishy and have strange texture. Asked the lady owner about it. She claimed it's frozen but fresh and they tasted normal to her. I returned the ikura and continued to finish the rest of don as I was dying of hunger. She later comes back with the check and discounted $1.5 off from $16.5 as a courtesy. I challenged her nicely that the ikura, being major part of the bowl, should be worth more. She was livid and said she was already being accommodating. She went back and took off $3 from the original price. I paid, tipped a dollar unwillingly and left. I think it is absolutely okay for restaurants to make mistakes. Just admit that they messed up, be humble about it and move on. Negatives could sometimes turn into positives if this was handled correctly. This was unfortunately not the case!"
1180,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"The atmosphere is charming, homey, and sweet. The place feels like your living room at home, but NICER. Great staff and women-owned and -operated. Mrs. Parsley herself is always there and very very sweet. The food is OUT OF THIS WORLD. So so so delicious. The Chicken Ramen (there are a few, I got the one at the bottom of the menu) in particular was just amazing, as were all the apetizers. We're moving into the neighborhood so we're sure this is going to become a weekly go-to place for us!"
1181,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is some of the best sushi in the neighborhood. The fish is actually fresh. The cuts on the meat are really generous. Its not a value-price sushi place. This is the place you should go if you want good quality fish (ie. not frozen or drowned in sauce) and genuine home-styled Japanese food.Great hidden place. Good for meetings, bringing a family, and just getting out for a good dinner."
1182,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Lovely place, unexpected in the area. Great food, stylish interior, pleasant music, very ectlectic. The owner, who's here basically all the time, makes sure you feel good, which you definitely do. At first a bit disappointed they don't deliver, but it's so worthy to take a trip and eat there, seriously. Five stars and one heart on top!"
1183,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"What a find. It's this kind of place--throughly homegrown and an obvious labor of love--that defines eating ""off the grid"" of the ho-hum in New York. The ambience of this micro-space is warm and welcoming, and makes the most of small square footage with some common tables. (Those who bristle at that can wait for a private space.) I started with an eel appetizer. This being my favorite fish, I was afraid it might not satisfy. Thankfully, my fears were dashed as I was knocked over by the freshness and flavor. Equally as satisfying was my entree--a bowl of salmon, pickles, vegetables and rice. (I wish I remembered the name of it, but it's towards the back of the menu.)We had the seaweed and buckwheat teas after dinner--both a nice departure from green tea. The proprietress, a very pleasant woman, strives to set the restaurant apart from more Americanized sushi restaurants, and the results are amazing. I'd like to note that she and her staff are exceptionally gracious and polite--even when faced with rudeness. During our visit, a band of bratty prep kids, visiting from out of town, had a problem with their bank card and treated the waitress and owner very badly (swearing, slammed the door, etc.). They responded with firm kindness and deflected their ignorance."
1184,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Chopped Parsley is so small, so cute, and so ""out of the way"" you would never notice it. My friend Dale Dobson brought me here with some friends after work. It's right in the neighborhood and quite affordable. It is a very cozy, intimate little Japanese cafe, juice Bar. The sitting capacity is no more than 20! Real small, but so tastefully done. All wood, very ""earthy"" and somewhat ""primal"". Beautiful Japanese laps hang by the corners and cute table lights illuminate the ""proximity"".You have two tables where groups can sit and the some single and some double. It resembles a ""log cabin"" in Mt. Kisco, New York, or New Paltz. Extremely cozy (very sensual when it rains. The scent or aroma of the wood in there comes ALIVE). PERFECT for ""CLANDESTINE MEETINGS...""(at least it ""feels"" like it, if the proper elements present themselves).Now for the FOOD!Their Garden Salad and Table Salad; composed of mixed greens and separate ""side"" salads indigenous to Japan, are EXCELLENT. When taking a spoon full, the exotic flavors just BURST like little SUPERNOVAE in your mouth.There salad is TWEEKIN'! And whatever AILMENT you THOUGHT you had, just melts away...You feel ""healed"" and good! Just good!Next is the SOUPS! Wow, again, very earthy and very pharmaceutical, because you really feel  the DIFFERENCE, once you had your ""light full"". It is excellent for HOT SUMMER MONTHS.Everything else, is just HEAVENLY...FIVE STARS (my very first)"
1185,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Great little spot. Very friendly owner and cozy environment. Food was delicious and fresh ! Loved the home made green tea cheese cake !
1186,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This place is cute, but when I sat back to think about the pros and cons, the cons were more weighty. The short version is: seating is (very) uncomfortable and awkward, the food is underwhelming and made with Trader Joe's ingredients, the restroom was out of service, the heat from the kitchen/kitchen lighting is bothersome, all the windows were left open while the A/C was one (still hot inside, also against the law), our dinner was served anachronistically making for a not great experience. Honestly, I'd give them only 1 star but I'm making it 2 because the host was---exceptionally nice---which is rare in NYC.   Seating: The place is very tiny, but they've maximized the space seating-wise. We sat on the left when you enter, so we had one of the low tables. These tables look great, but they're far too low, and too small to sit for anything more than an appetizer, making the sit both awkward and uncomfortable. My back was very sore after. The regular tables and chairs seem totally fine, but this low table arrangement comprises about half of their overall seating, so you've got a 50/50 shot on seating comfort, unless you're very short. Food: The food is ok, but underwhelming. The sushi was warm when served, and the roll was loose. It wasn't a functional problem, but made for odd presentation. Our food was brought out in 4 intervals. We ordered an appetizer and 4 rolls total that came out in this order: Roll 1, Appetizer & Roll 2, Roll 3, Roll 4. It was a little odd and kind of annoying to get the appetizer out of order, and to not know what was coming out next. I understand that it's a small operation, so the intervals are due to handling multiple orders and only having a very small surface area on which to serve, but the ordering just didn't make sense. Another thing that bothered me about the food is that the spices were all from Trader Joe's, clearly visible because the kitchen is open to the dining area. I'm sure other companies do this, but it wasn't ""homey"" to me as much as it was just kind of cheap, and made me feel bad for eating out when I could be using the same ingredients at home. A/C and heat: Unfortunately we sat near the kitchen, which made for some extra heat and very, very bright lighting. Way too bright for a dinner service. I recognize wanting to create air flow, but they had all of the windows open and had the A/C on. Tsk tsk. Restroom: I also got to observe a spectacle with the restroom. About half an hour into our meal I noted that someone asked the host if they could use the restroom, but the host said someone was in there. I didn't see anyone go in during that time, but didn't think much of it. I noticed the host eventually speak about it to someone I believe was the owner. The host went back, knocked several times, but no response. Also the lights seemed off from the inside. Eventually the host taped a sign on the door saying the restroom was out of service. I think, in fact, they'd merely locked themselves out of their own restroom. The only restroom being broken in a tiny restaurant is a pretty big problem. It obviously wasn't premeditated or anything, but I felt awful for the people who asked to use the restroom but couldn't.This place might be great on a weekday afternoon, when you're not in any kind of rush, the weather is nice out, you feel like some warm sushi and you won't have to use the restroom at all. Although I didn't meet her, the owner's story sounds awesome and I truly appreciate local businesses and the effort they put in to making their communities better. Again, it's a cute place, it seems like a great idea. Nonetheless, the execution is lacking."
1187,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I don't know this neighborhood well, so was relying on Yelp reviews is what brought me in.  I was delighted!  At first it seemed good nice atmosphere with a homey vibe.  A little Japanese woman running about attending to people, it felt like we were sitting in her kitchen.  And honestly we were!  It's her place, a dream of opening a little place were people can come and hang out just relax was realized.  And it is awesome!  The food was great, we ordered a fairly board sampling from the menu and nothing was disappointing.  We struck up a convo with ""Mrs. Parsley"". And her story blew us away.  A musician & DJ that came to the US in the 90's, played with the Wutang clan for several years, got into music producing, and eventually opened us this little gem last year.  The interior was most hand done by her.  It's all so charming and fun, a perfect topper to great Japanese food."
1188,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Love this place. Hip yet unassuming atmosphere. Fresh food made with love. Good drink list. Fresh fresh fresh! Owner and servers are so nice and accommodating! My new favorite neighborhood spot!
1189,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I don't normally give a place 5 stars but this place stands out to me in our neighborhood because it's the only place you can get authentic Japanese sushi.  I do NOT agree with most of the negative reviews here. Try this place if you haven't!! I don't know why I waited so long. Despite what some of the other reviews have stated, I don't agree with people's complaints about the prices. I have dinner with my husband and we paid under $20 per person. For sushi, that is a complete bargain! Food taste: excellentFood Quality: excellent/very freshFood Price: reasonable Ambience: cute/charming Service: friendly/polite $15 for a sushi bowl is NOT overpriced, especially if it's truly fresh.  Rolls range from $5-8, Nigiri $3-3.50 per piece and specialty rolls $9.50-$14.  Sushi set is only $22! (For those of you who live in the neighborhood, Geisha and Mama Sushi are NOT authentic and I wouldn't trust the quality of the fish that they serve there. If you look at Geisha's sushi bar, I don't trust the cleanliness of their bar at all. And they precut all the sushi, NOT cut to order)"
1190,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"The food was great-- very fresh!  The service was friendly but it was SO HOT inside.  Not sure if it was a one-off & the AC was broken or what. Regardless, I'll be back."
1191,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"A yelp find I went after the current rating of 4.5 stars and felt like I had to try it. I stopped in with my roommate to find a great atmosphere, wonderful service but a slightly overpriced menu. After ordering a few rolls it seemed like just ordinary sushi. Nothing crazy just the simple sushi seemed like I could've gotten the same stuff anywhere for the same quality. I also didn't understand the happy hour where they only had 1 option which was a bottled beer that was $6 instead of $7. It didn't seem like much a steal to my roommate and I. There could also be more options when it comes to the happy hour as well."
1192,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This place was amazing, Feels like you are in Japan, Loved the food, fish is super fresh and service was amazing, cant wait to go back"
1193,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Affordable and delicious sushi. Wish service were a little faster but great light dinner. 'Nuff said.
1194,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,This is such a great new addition to the neighborhood! You're waited on by the owner herself & she's so hospitable and lovely- Miss Parsley! I had the grilled salmon roll and it was super fresh and delicious! I tried the shrimp dumplings and terrific! Last thing I had was her California roll and it was bangin! Great prices for the neighborhood and happy to have a new option in our neighborhood. Will definitely be back!
1195,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,I'm back... still enjoyable. Beer & wine is in the house!!! Congratulations Chopped Parsley. My only suggestion is that you make the rolls a bit wider to provide a bigger portion size. ENJOY!!!
1196,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"... Not bad at all. Very quaint establishment in Harlem. Food was great, service was equal. I'll definitely be back here. Beer and Wine TBD soon. So BYOB."
1197,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Love this place! Went for a late weekday date night. Such a cozy spot! Loved the hot saki! Ordered a bunch of small plates and everything tasted awesome! (Particularly loved the shrimp dumplings!) the service was awesome and the dishes were well spaced out. The owner was such a sweet lady! Will definitely return again :)
1198,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Santa came early this year, opening a sushi spot just outside my building. Really cute place, the food is delicious, the price is great and the service even better. If you're looking to have lunch or a lighter meal, just some tea, coffee or smoothie, you should come here. It's genuine and cozy.I will definitely come back, it's too good not to."
1199,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"My new go-to takeout place for sure! Good selection, veg-friendly, and fantastically-priced. I wish the sushi rolls had a little more filling and less rice but otherwise, everything was made super fresh (the kitchen is tiny and I watched my food get cooked while chatting with the super friendly and knowledgable staff) and yummy. The edamame weren't mushy or too salty.I ran into the owner about a week later and she remembered me too- that speaks volumes for her character.Exited to explore the menu more, including their selection of new-to-me teas. Highly recommend for delicious, healthy, quick, affordable food."
1200,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Price is nice. Came during the grand opening. Service is excellent and very friendly. The cafe au lait was delicious as was the green tea. Everything is cooked fresh, made when ordered. The place is super cozy and would be great for a light meal and a place to relax."
1201,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Ok - I went back and had a proper meal there tonight and ""THANKS PARSLEY"" is all I've got to say.  It was easily the best Sushi Rolls and tea I've ever had in Hamilton Heights.  Attention to detail is evident.  Such a great setting and delicious Magic Kani & Dragon Rolls plus Soba Cha made for a lovely meal with my baby."
1202,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Wonderful little new cafe with a Japanese tilt.  This place is really cool, furnished with lots of found objects, done in a stylish way.It doesn't really fit into any of the Yelp boxes - it's not a Japanese Restaurant, yet they serve Sushi and Shrimp Shu Mai.  Also, smoothies, unique teas and coffee too.The vibe is EXCELLENT - this is a place you will want to hang out in with friends - eating/snacking on delicious nibbles.I had the Shrimp Shu- Mai and it was top notch.  Lovely soy based dipping sauce and even tasy mustard.  Attention to details are evident.  Parsley is the owner and she is into QUALITY and you can tell.  Come and support this great new spot in Hamilton Heights."
1203,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I'm so happy that a good affordable Japanese cafe has finally opened in this neighborhood. I stopped by Chopped Parsley today to check it out and was very satisfied. The space is cozy but not crammed, very clean with good decor. We ordered the mackerel and shrimp shiumai for appetizers, miso soup, grilled salmon roll, chicken udon and chicken soba. Food is tasty and decent portion for the price. You know that Ms. Parsley, the lovely Japanese owner, put a lot of care and personal touch into her food and her place. I'll definitely be a regular here."
1204,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Loved everything I had here! The chicken udon warmed me to the core on a very cold day! It tasted amazing and was very filling and the Sushi was just perfect!
1205,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"It was nice, here. I walked in with my laptop, because I needed a place to finish off the day's work. The lady who greeted me was very friendly, and welcoming -- and she seemed to enjoy conversations with visitors, and that is always a plus. I had a fish apetizer, and an Earl Grey Tea, and a Japanese Tea, and worked there for approximately two hours. The ambience was lively, but not so noisy as to be distracting. I was at a table that was generally shared by visitors, and at one point I did have the company of a couple -- although, I kept to myself, owing to having to finish my work, and they enjoyed their date. The other tables had people coming and going, or people waiting for their take out food, while enjoying their own conversations. As it was not too crowded when I went, I felt that it was a good place to hang out."
1206,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Just found this place tonight. My fiancé describes it as ""sexy sushi"" and I agree on that point. It must also be said that this is delicious, fresh, inventive, lovely sushi. One of those places you don't want everyone to know about....yet!"
1207,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"While the seating is pleasant, the menu is limited and expensive compared to geisha sushi restaurant. Portions are extremely small and food is prepared in a kitchen equipped similar to a dormitory."
1208,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"The sushi is good but the atmosphere is better. I enjoy this cozy and intimate neighborhood spot to get my sushi fix, enjoy a cool beer and have some alone time. I shall be back!"
1209,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is a small little cafe that offers amazing food. I stumbled upon this place a few days ago, and loved it. This place is new only about 2 months old and it has a few growing pains but if one is patient you will enjoy a great meal in a very intimate setting. The place only has about 4 tables and it is in a communal setting. Everything is made there fresh to order so it takes some time but worth it. It is great that Harlem is getting new restaurants."
1210,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Finding this restaurant felt like finding $200 in a pair of jeans stored in the back of my closet!! I was so excited to find it. I love Japanese food, and with friends who are either Japanese or expats that have lived in Japan, I learned to appreciate good Japanese food. Since I moved to Hamilton Heights in 2006, I never expected a Japanese restaurant up here, much less one that can compare to the ones in the EV, where we usually go. Well this one does. I LOVE the people, their friendliness and the food stunned me. We had a couple of rolls, the Kitsune chicken udon, an app, and some sake. All were great! And on a frigid December night, the noodle bowl was just perfect. I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because although the decor was really comfortable, a little quirky but fun, gives you a feeling you're in old Japan, it was too bright I wanted to wear sunglasses. And the seats with the narrow bench-tables were cozy, it just felt like I was going to drop something because the table was too narrow, and a bit far from you if you scoot back on your seat to get comfortable. If you're just there for some apps and sake, it's the perfect spot. But kinda clumsy if you're having a bowl of udon.   But I will surely be back, and one of these days, with my friends in tow. Now, if only I could find a good place for Takoyaki in Sugar Hill..."
1211,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Chopped Parsley is such a lovely hidden place worth trying and continue visiting. The ambience is so cozy and chill. Ms. Parsley is so attentive and cute. The food is really delicious. Came here with my mom who has never had Asian soup and she was hooked. I recommend the chicken Udon and shrimp shumai and their cute and petite coconut and chocolate chip cookies. You will not regret it and if you do oh well!!! :)
1212,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Everything about this place is amazing - the prices, food, the music. I could eat here every day. The ingredients are fresh and everything is made-to-order."
1213,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Extremely extremely slow service. we arrived there on a Friday night and there were only 3 other couples there. It took over an hour for us to receive 2 rolls and a chirashi bowl. Portions were small and nothing really stood out to me to justify the price and the wait time. Basically your average take-out sushi place on the upper east side would have been better. Very disappointed as the reviews were all great. The only plus is that the decor seemed really quaint and it felt more like a coffee shop/cafe than a restaurant.
1214,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Updated - the owner clearly took issue with my review and clearly mistook me for other complaints by customers.  So from this we can gather that there have been multiple complaints about this cafe. So I suggest you get yourself in order and stop moaning about customer complaints and do better
1215,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Sitting here at 7.56on Sunday evening and the two staff are not seeming to cope.  I ordered noodle soup with chicken and I got a half filled bowl of salty fishy noodles and three bits of chicken. Very sloppy service and frankly rude. As a new local restaurant just up the road from where I'm staying, I really wanted to give them 5 stars but sorry it's 2 * and here I am being generous. Drowning in salt and stinking of fish - yuk!"
1216,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"After walking by a few times we tried it for dinner and it is excellent. Great sushi, salmon ceviche and spicy daikon salad. The shumai are delicious and delicate and the homemade matcha cheesecake is as good any cheesecake in NY and I know! The owner is a wonderful woman from northern Japan. She is lovely and takes great care of the customers. The ambiance is charming and very much like a small Tokyo place. It is as close to a true Japanese experience as you find in New York or even California. We love it and will return often and try the Udon and Soba soups as winter settles in."
1217,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"A simple, clean, healthy, and seemingly authentic Japanese cafe. A delightfully calm and relatively inexpensive place for a bite or beverage. I had a big red bowl of chicken soba on a rainy day and it was just right. I look forward to trying the salads, sushi, and smoothies. Try it out!"
1218,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"A small but perfectly curated sushi menu in a simple, welcoming space. Everything we tried was beautifully prepared and incredibly tasty. And the owner/manager couldn't have been nicer. Hamilton Heights finally has a great Japanese restaurant."
1219,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Incredible. I think this restaurant is so great! I feel I must make this my ""go to"" place for sushi, tea, and internet to finish studies and work! Chopped Parsley is a restaurant of great quality. I actually read every review and everyone loves it!"
1220,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I happened upon this place and decided to give it a try. I was pleasantly surprised with everything I ordered. As well as my Date.  A quaint, quiet restaurant with lovely ambiance and most importantly delicious food!"
1221,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Just finished eating here for lunch. I was so excited to see this pop up a few blocks away from my apartment. The decor is super cute inside and the food did not disappoint. We started with the green tea, the arugula and the kale salad. I could not  decide which salad was better because they were both amazing and fairly large. Then we ordered the salmon and steak sushi rolls to share which were also delicious. And finally, finished with the chicken udon soup. I left feeling very satisfied and full. The service was also great. I will definitely be back soon."
1222,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Since it is more on a side street, Chopped Parsley is not easy to find if you aren't deliberately looking for it.  But that shouldn't stop you from visiting as the ambiance, service, and most importantly the food are all fantastic.  The space is limited, but they did a good job of placing the tables so rather than feeling crowded it actually feels quite comfortable.  The hostess / server is a really really nice, sweet lady, and everyone else who works there was very friendly without being intrusive or overbearing.I had the kitsune chicken udon which was delicious, especially the udon noodles themselves.  My friend ate the inari / asparagus roll which was also excellent.  I'll be ordering both of these items in the future again for sure.Definitely a hidden neighborhood gem and perfect place for sushi or other Japanese food in Hamilton Heights!"
1223,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,The cozy atmosphere and warm staff make this place a must in upper Harlem. Their smoked salmon and cucumber role is one of the most beautifully crafted sushi dishes I have ever had in New York. If your looking for an off the beat sushi option Chopped Parsley is a great fit.
1224,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Great artsy atmosphere, fantastic authentic Japanese food... what can I say! Five stars for this yet hidden gem in Harlem!"
1225,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"The food here is fresh, delicious and inexpensive. The staff is awesome and clearly take pride in what they produce. The special rolls are creative and well thought out. I just wish they had batter seating options. The place gets filled really quickly and the set up is a little awkward. Not enough to deter me from going because the food is excellent."
1226,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Amazing! Chopped Parsley is something really special and unlike anything else in the neighborhood. Fantastic service. The food was fresh, simple, skillfully made, and absolutely delicious. A intimate, but inviting space with great design. I can't wait to go back soon."
1227,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This is the second time I've eaten from this place, and it is amazing. The fish is so fresh! I had the salmon avocado cucumber, and the eel avocado. Both delicious as usual. And on a whim, I ordered the grilled salmon. I rarely get cooked rolls, but it was recommended, so I tried it. It was amazing. The salmon was cooked but not overcooked and super moist, just amazing. My only problem with this place is that its not open for lunch, but even their schedule seems to add to the charm. Love it!"
1228,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Tried this place today and was very impressed. I had been watching the progress of the restaurant as it was being worked on so I was so excited to finally try all the goodness. The miso soup had great flavor and consistency. You can tell the owner takes great pride in the ingredients used and the preparation. I also tried the California Rolls and the Steak Rolls (I think that's what it's called). Both were delicious. Great atmosphere and friendly staff. I will definitely be back and not just because I live a few buildings down.
1229,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Tiny adorable restaurant, the food was great, but the service was slow. They are new so probably still working out their system. Half of the tables are more for drinking rather than eating (low and very narrow), but the place doesn't have liquor license. So, maybe they are planning for it."
1230,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I had the grilled salmon roll and it was delicious also shrimp dumplings the best. have a new Will be back,Pamela B.NYC"
1231,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Authentic Japanese food on 146th street is such a treasure for the neighborhood. The quality of the fish is excellent, the proprietors are lovely, and the price is right for Manhattan. I usually get the Chirashi with an eel appetizer and it is a satisfying and large meal. If you've never been to Japan: this is what it tastes like."
1232,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Love love love this place and the welcoming feel. Get the eel and although simple the miso soup is perfection.
1233,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"This place is cute, the food is very tasty and affordable. Had a smoothie, shumai, and udon noodles. Like Arnold said, ""I'll be Back""!"
1234,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Nice, tasty, smaller alternative to some of the other sushi offerings in the neighborhood. Portions, especially drinks, are smaller than others, the quality of food is pretty much in line with comparable establishments. Seating capacity is only about 15-25, but because it is not on a major avenue / street seating is probably easier to come by."
1235,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Excellent food. Very fresh. Steak roll was interesting but not my favorite. Very cute secluded place off Amsterdam. Prices are very reasonable.
1236,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. And all you ""new"" businesses in Harlem should take note. This is how it is done. That is all."
1237,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"great owner, great ambiance, great food. we loved it!! we chatted with the owner a bit, and that only ensured that this is my favorite new local spot."
1238,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"A diamond in the rough - top quality food, cozy space and sweet owners... They have gluten free soy sauce too."
1239,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"We love this place and have been here twice already. The shrimp shumai and mackerel starters are excellent,  and all the sushi is expertly crafted.  We are especially fond of the teas: seaweed, roasted twig,  and buckwheat,  as well as several caffeinated options.  The proprietor is friendly and knowledgeable,  and the decor is charming and quirky. The vibe is calm and we are really pleased to have this restaurant in our neighborhood."
1240,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Just finished eating here for lunch. I was so excited to see this place pop up a few blocks from my apartment.

And finally, finished with the chicken udon soup. I left feeling very satisfied and full. The service was also great. I will definitely be back soon."
1241,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Great place. The maki rolls are very good, as is everything else I've had there. Nice, small menu. The owner, a long time resident of Sugar Hill, is super friendly. It's a nice change from all the corporate, faux-gastro-pub nonsense opening up all around here. Warm atmosphere all around."
1242,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Excellent sushi, fresh and delicious. And everyone that works there is so friendly and kind. So glad to have them in the neighborhood."
1243,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"Absolutely love this place! It is a great concept and I am very happy that it opened in my neighborhood. People are usually surprised when I explain that you can stop in for either coffee/tea or sushi. The concept works great though! To me, it feels like just a touch of Japanese decor, which is really just the narrow, thick, minimalistic beams for food and drinks at some of the seating areas. The rest of it feels like a great Harlem cafe. Food and staff are great! Simple menu with tasty sushi."
1244,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,Congratulations Yumika!!! You've created a fantastic restaurant in an area that drastically needed something new.  This is the place that I will go to when in this neighborhood. I can't wait to return!
1245,g9IFea9brBr8j8awcdOBOw,"service was tooooooooo slow. waited our first and second to come out more than 15- 20 min each time......and the owner was training the only chef! i expected too much over outstanding reviews before my very first visit, i wish i could give five...sorry."
1246,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Excellent Sicilian Grandma slices. Picture perfect, crispy olive oil crust, tangy fresh tomato sauce and stretchy mozzarella. Perfect at $4.00 per slice."
1247,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Terrible service won't be ordering from this place anymore. To many people behind the counter and they all seemed confused. Girl at the register just finished counting cash. And working the register took my order after taking my order she went and added the cheese on my meat patties opening the meat patties with her hands so she can add the cheese in between. Didn't wash her hands after counting the dirty cash. No hair nets on employees. Girls taking order and taking payment from customers also helping prep food without washing hands or wearing gloves. Reporting this pizza shop to department of health. Customers pay attention how your food is being handled.
1248,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,I ordered Delivery the other night.. 2 meals 2 salads and calamari.. waited an hour driver comes to deliver only one bag of food not thinking I bring it in the house I open it up and half the food was missing! I got the 2 salads and 1 meal only.  I call I explained to the girl I was missing food.  She puts me on hold .. says there was a computer glitch and the kitchen only got half the order.  I knew it was bs Bc they sent 2 salads! I wait another hour for the rest of the food! Same driver comes back and apologized for the mix and said he gave my food to the wrong people and he tried to get it back but they ate it!  What in the world??? I asked him if he was really trying to give me food he gave to someone else and go back to get it?!? He rolled his eyes .. I love Mangia's but I will NEVER eat there again! Totally disgusted  beware if you order from them delivery..
1249,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Their grandma pizza is subpar.  I should have known the pizza was not fresh when the cheese looked like a yellow onion.  But hey, I was on a pizza tour and figured I should try it.  The slice itself was disappointing because it was too doughy and dense. It was also dry because they use very little tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella, pesto, or garlic. Overall, it was terrible and I would eat anywhere but here.  To make matters worse one of the employees decided it was a good idea to mop the floor with ammonia at 4pm and while a large group of customers attempted to eat old dry pizza."
1250,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"If I could give this place Zero stars I would!!!! I ordered food at 5pm today. It arrived about 5:50. That's when the disaster began. I opened my food and the Plastic container for the wings was shattered and there was plastic bits all over them. My sausage and pepper roll was burnt. My chicken wrap was so overcooked and chewy. Tiramisu was all watery. Potato croquette had no flavor and the garlic bread had so much garlic it made me gag. I immediately called to complain about 6:00. I was told someone would call me back immediately. Over 3 hours later no phone call so I called back. The woman I spoke to said she told 2 people and was surprised no one called. So finally I speak to ""the guy in charge who is not really a manager but someone to speak to."" Well he says because my order was $39 it was too much money to refund me. I explained the food was completely inedible. He said maybe he could refund half. I explained that  is unacceptable. He asked if I can bring the food back (now over 3 hours later) I said the food is in my garbage pail if he would like it he can come and get it. I ordered delivery I wasn't about to drive there while I was already in bed to prove to him my food was disgusting. I told him i took pictures before throwing them out. He put me on hold and came back to say he was gonna process the refund within 20 minutes. I said ok. Well 20 minutes later at 10pm I get a phone call from the delivery driver saying they re-made my entire order and its outside my house. At this point I was livid!!!! Who the hell wants to eat the same crappy food from earlier now at 10:00 at night! Why would they remake it when I clearly asked for a refund and that was agreed upon and then they just resend food. So I call back speak to the same ""guy in charge"" and was told it's impossible to refund me. I asked to speak to the owner who is apparently not there for another 4 days. If you leave someone in charge they should be able to make an executive decision and this ""guy in charge"" was not accomodating nor able to help in any way. I will never order from this place ever again. ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE!!!! If no refund is issued I will dispute it!"
1251,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This place has officially turned to garbage! I don't know if it's new owners or chefs but the food is horrible! The pizza taste like it 3 days old and heated up in a microwave. The toppings on the pizza taste sour. I'm officially done. Don't waste your money, it's not the original mangias that we loved."
1252,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This place is still good but it has gone downhill a bit from when they first opened up. The only thing that they make well are pizzas. Everything else is average and their salads are horrible. Every time I order a salad, my chicken is so burnt that it's sour and the lettuce and vegetables always taste like they have dirt on them. I'm done with the salads here and will just stick to the pizzas"
1253,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I've come here for a slice with my son quite a few times. I like that they are so quick, and the unlimited refills are definitely a major plus. But, the last time I went was definitely the last visit for me. I've noticed as I have stood at the counter a few times, how nonexistent the use of any gloves are. I've witnessed the counter girl get on her phone, take money, and grab slices to throw in the oven. I looked at everyone else behind her preparing pizzas etc, and same. I had already paid at this point and my hungry child was waiting so I tried to shrug it off. The last time I went in, I was waiting on line and the woman in front of me ordered one of those breaded balls on the display case. The counter girl took the ball WITH HER BARE HANDS, and then proceeded to take cash, answer the phone, and grab slices. I thought maybe she had some paper in her hands. Well, just as I thought this, the woman asked for one more of those mystery breaded balls. So unfortunately I was able to get a better view at the bare hands now touching the food and once again, ringing someone up. Needless to say, we opted for the pizza across the street. Cute place, but I just cannot."
1254,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Had an errand to run in the neighborhood and after a quick Yelp search, I found this place.  They have a great selection of specialty slices.  There are about 8 tables inside with enough space to comfortably fit 4 people per table.  Apparently though, they seem to do quite a bit of take out and delivery.  After sampling a few items I could see why.  Chicken vodka slice, chicken francese slice, chicken marsala slice and stromboli we're all great.  Very generous portions, fair prices and the staff was friendly.  I would definitely return if in the area."
1255,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Been coming here for years! Definetly the best pizza in the area! Slightly pricey but best gormet quality for sure! Try the chicken franchese slice! Sooo gooood!
1256,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I probably order delivery from Mangia at least once a week. Food is great and they give you monster portions. It's usually enough for lunch the next day. Delivery is quick, food arrives piping hot. Delivery people are courteous and friendly. Try the Chicken Scarpariello, (I'm  sure I spelled that wrong) it's awesome."
1257,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I wish I took a pic of the bottom, because it was worse. I asked for my refund with the intention to give it to the delivery guy (it's not his fault the food was burnt). But, they didn't even bother to show up. At this point I'm pissed. YOU GUYS CLEARLY SAW THAT THIS WAS BURNED, but you still sent it. NOT COOL. They suck at delivery. They just don't care about customer satisfaction."
1258,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I like this place. It does have the potential to be the best in the neighborhood, but they have some issues. One: the pizza flavor and texture isn't consistent. When I order in, everything is perfect, but when I order delivery, the pizza isn't the same. Either too much dough, too much cheese, or barely any sauce. Two: I know things get busy, but sometimes the tables are greasy and crummy, and with such a nicely designed pizza shop, the tables should be nice and clean and presentable always. Last: those wings are horrible. They are slimy, fatty, and just weird. I don't know if I've ordered them on a bad day, but it doesn't taste good. Also, the sauce shouldn't be refrigerator cold."
1259,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Ordered a chicken franchise pie for delivery. It was very good. Loaded with chicken. Garlic bread with mozzarella was very garlicky and delicious. Definitely gonna go back and try other food
1260,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Mangia is one of the newer Pizzerias the the neighborhood.  It's been around a few years but not as long as the other ones in Pelham Bay.  For your normal slice or Sicilian around Crosby Avenue I'd recommend either Crosby Pizza or Joes Pizza but Mangia's is the place to go if you want specialty slices or Dinners.  Their specialty slices include Chicken Vodka, Chicken Marsala, Frances's, etc.  The pic I attached to this post was the Chicken Parm Dinner.  Not bad.  Pretty healthy portion too."
1261,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Sicilian was great! However the regular personal pizza pie sucked....burnt, extremely thin and not portioned at all"
1262,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Ordered a meat lovers and the meat was under the cheese. Every slice the cheese slide off along with the meat. A huge mess had to use a spatula. Very greasy and soggy.
1263,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Food is way over priced , can get just as good if not better food at much better prices at Crosby pizza across the street or franks two blocks down"
1264,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Great local pizzeria! Love their specialty slices including the Chicken Marsala, Chicken Parm, and Eggplant w/Fresh Mozzarella.  Always very friendly and fast delivery."
1265,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I have been to Mangia's countless amount of times and each time i enjoy what i am having so much. I have had everything from their chicken parm hero's, Stromboli, regular slices specialty slices and calzone's and all are fantastic.My favorite thing to get from there when i order a pie with a group of people is the Meat lovers supreme pizza. They put the bulk of the meat under the cheese, which i find spectacular. They also add some more meats top of the cheese. One slice is so filling and delicious.Multiple times i have ordered on line and their delivery service is speedy, their staff is friendly as well.This is the place to go if you want a regular slice, pie or many of the other countless items on their menu!"
1266,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Their plain and regular pizza kinda sucks. Very basic tasting, almost seems like they use cheap ingredients to save money. That said, their deluxe / specialty pies are very good. The chicken vodka, or barbecue chicken pies are excellent. But the real whammy for this restaurant is what they did to me recently on a delivery. After almost 2 hours of not showing up with my food, I called them to ask about my order and they said the delivery was on it's way. It NEVER came. I called back and they had the nerve to put me on hold. Still no answer about the food. I ended up canceling my order and they acted like they didn't even care. No apology. No explanation. Nothing. Their food = C ratingService = F ratingOverall, don't waste your time. There are plenty of pizzerias in the area that serve as competition. Let them learn from their mistakes the hard way."
1267,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"The pizza is great. Especially the vodka pizza slice. I tried their vodka pasta once and I was sadly disappointed. Twice, I ordered a chicken roll that had hair in it. You can eat there, but just look over your food before eating."
1268,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,This was my first time ordering from mangia's Rice Balls were tasty and the potato croquet. Good pizza!!
1269,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Wow wow wow so good ! I have been searching for the best pizza in town and I definitely found it . Everything was so good and fresh . Perfect amount of cheese and sauce! Will be making this my go to shop when I order out . Super excited to try out their speciality slices !! Ps - delivery  was super fast and friendly .
1270,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Always get my slices from here! Great pizza, so many choices and great garlic knots! Slices are huge and the flavor is plentiful. I've also gotten their baked ziti and it was a nice portion.Love this place !"
1271,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This is my second time ordering here. My first time was when they first opened. I had the pizza and it wasn't the best. My boyfriend had wanted to retry this place for a while and I gave in. We both ordered pasta dishes.He enjoyed his linguine with hot marinara sauce and calamari. I enjoyed the penne vodka.  Both pasta was a little over cook.  We forgot to note al dente, so if you like med/ hard pasta you should note it. For me, the vodka wasn't the best I ever had but it wasn't the worst. We both got salad on the side. Their raspberry dressing was way to sweet for us although their house balsamic had a delicious taste to i. Garlic not were good size and quality. They had good garlic flavor, which some places can lack it.Delivery was a normal wait, I think we waited 45min.Overall we had a better experience then before. We will be ordering from them again."
1272,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,I ordered a Margherita pizza and garlic knots for delivery. Food was amazing! The pizza was exactly the New York style pizza I wanted and garlic knots were tasty. I recommend this place for pizza. Delivery was smooth and driver called me when he arrived! I ordered the large pizza for 2 people and had extra slices offer for the next day. They have good vegetarian options including a vegan pizza. Make sure to call to ask.
1273,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Calzone review only....Don't bother They have them frozen or somethingBy the time you get it its-burnt dough with warm fillingPizza was very good
1274,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great spot! The pizza is really good and the rolls are super bomb! Delivery is very quick and food is always good!
1275,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"So today I tried the Mangia Tuscana Panini... and it was so good it inspired me to update my review. Omg. It was absolutely delicious! I didn't even get a chance to take a photo because I was so wrapped up in this panini. It had grilled chicken, grilled mushrooms, zucchini, asiago, balsamic, and basil dressing, all on their fresh baked ciabatta. It was absolute perfection. I don't know anywhere else that does a panini the way Mangia's does. I'm hooked! And for as many times as I've ordered, the delivery guy is always early or right on time; I'm never kept waiting. From the flavorful food to the delivery, you can count on Mangia to be consistent all around."
1276,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"So, full disclosure, I've never step foot into this place. I couldn't even tell you where it is. But I can tell you that I've ordered plenty of meals from here and 9 times out of 10 I'm satisfied. Most of the time my order arrives well before I expect it to and the food is always hot and ready to eat. There are lots of reviews here about the pizza so I won't elaborate too much on that, but I do want to talk about my favorite item on the menu - their signature Mangia Salad. On days when I want to pretend to eat healthy I order this salad and it's ALWAYS delicious. As per their menu: Spring mix, grilled zucchini, grilled portabello mushrooms, red onion, topped with gorgonzola cheese and balsamic dressing for $8.95. They give the option to add grilled chicken or shrimp, and if you do, I recommend the chicken. It's grilled to perfection, still juicy and tender with that awesome charred grill flavor which definitely adds another layer of complexity to the salad. Most times though, I just order the salad without meat because it's plenty flavorful on its own. To make the order minimum I usually also order a side of fries (I know, I know, it defeats the purpose).They also have great wraps, sandwiches, and paninis. Just last night I ordered the Mangia Portofino Panini which includes grilled vegetables, balsamic, and evoo on ciabatta bread. The bread was toasted just right , and no matter what meal you get them on, their grilled vegetables are always great. Whenever I'm looking for a filling, delicious and affordable meal during the week, chances are I'm ordering from Mangia. You'll definitely be satisfied eating here."
1277,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Truly great Customer service and grade A quality Ingredients. Authentic N.Y tasting Pizza + the pasta dishes are a generously  large portion.
1278,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Excellent Choice My friend suggested this place had a incredible grilled chicken salad I enjoyed it so much I will be returning today for another, I really enjoyed the walnuts and cranberry in the salad and the vingerette was perfect Highly Suggest"
1279,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I see all the Stars, and I'm thinking they probably messed mine up by mistake? My pizza was super salty...."
1280,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Just ordered 1/2 pepperoni 1/2 chicken vodka and it was delicious. Very good pizza! Definitely  one of the best in the area. Very cheesy.
1281,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Ridiculously good! My bf loves their pizza and we also love their chicken dishes. They're so incredibly nice and accommodating and delivery is prompt!
1282,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This place should have 5 stars across the board.I was hungry tonight and randomly decided to order hot heroes. I normally cook, but figured I'd give a new local place a try. I love supporting local businesses. I drove by here last week and saw this beautiful little place which really stands out with the signage and it kinda stuck in my head.Any whoooo. I ordered a Chicken Cutlet Hero and a Sausage and Pepper Hero. I have ordered the two from many different places in the past and many times it has been delivered horribly wrong.I really had no expectations, but to fill my stomach cause I was super starving. Keep in mind it's 9:30pm.At $8.95 and $7.95 I thought I was going to get a tiny hero, which is what is usually expected. NOW what I received was a completely different story. Two 12"" beautiful, boxed (not wrapped in foil), very neatly made heroes.The chicken cutlet was fresh and delicious, I asked for mayo and oil and vinegar on the side and my order was followed exactly as I asked. My bread was fresh and toasted enough so it was not soggy at all!!!The Sausage and Peppers were amazing. The sausage was juicy and tasty and not dry at all. I asked for a little mayo in it and that is what I was given; a little mayo. bread was toasted and held up perfectly.Delivery was extremely quick too. I ordered online, which was very easy and straight forward. And not too long after the delivery guy was at my door. Perfect execution!!!!I am extremely happy with my decision to order from Mangia's and can't wait to order again. I'm actually having my sister and her boyfriend over for dinner and will be sure to order takeout.How would I describe this place???Neat, tasty, delicious, quick and very friendly delivery people!!!!Can't wait to try the pasta!This girl is HAPPY!!!!"
1283,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Best pizza in town. They always use fresh ingredients and the slices are pretty big. I am always open to trying different types of pizzas here because I have never been disappointed. I am not sure about anything else on the menu, but I highly recommend getting pizza. I had their mozzarella sticks and garlic bread, but I wouldn't recommend. The mozzarella sticks were mediocre and garlic bread was way too garlicky."
1284,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Ordered the chicken cutlet parm hero and Cesar salad..both were great sizes and filling,delivery was super fast,will order again"
1285,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This was the worst experience I have ever had with a pizzeria. My family and I ordered and picked up 2 large pies, chicken Parmesan, shrimp parmigiana, buffalo wings and a Jamaican beef patty. Totaling around $90. You would think after spending more than $50 dollars at a pizzeria they would offer you some free incentive, nope! You thought WRONG, not even a free 2 liter bottle of soda worth roughly $.99 at your local stop and shop. However, that is not the point of this review. I myself had ordered the shrimp parmigiana and oh boy, did I regret that decision. This dish came with linguini pasta with fried butterfly shrimp parmesan over ""red sauce"" and a ton of melted mozzarella , bread and salad on the side. It was unbelievable how fishy the shrimp tasted. I have had sushi at gas stations that had less ""fishy"" taste than the Mangia's shrimp parmesan. The linguini was super dry with little to no ""red sauce"" and the fishy taste from the shrimp leaked on to the pasta. Totally unbearable and did not finish the meal. Let's move on to the Pizza. We ordered 1 plain pie and 1 pepperoni pie. Since my meal was uneatable, I had to try a slice of the plain pizza. Again we're in the city where Pizza is known to be great! Wrong again, I bite into a plain slice and all I taste is a rubbery slice overloaded with too much cheese and again did not finish this meal. I'm from upstate NY and my god Pizza there is 10x better than Mangia's. The only good thing I had from this order was their chicken parmigiana. There was a lot of chicken in the platter which is a plus but, the chicken parmigiana was at best decent/below par from other pizzerias I had in the city. I wish I could give this review something less than 1 star. I will never order from here again."
1286,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"They have the best pizza, and heroes. Also their chicken wings are the bomb. I love the bbq chicken pizza,and mozzarella and tomato pizza!!!"
1287,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,This place is nasty. They never clean tables and even worst no running water in bathroom for customers and employee to wash there hands . I thought the first time I used the bathroom that just had to repair but 3 months later went in to see and still no running water. Not eating in a restaurant where employees don't wash hands and serve food. Time to call dept of health!
1288,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Great Grandma Slice! Hands down one of my favorites. Might be a little too garlicky for some but it was perfect for my tastebuds. The Nutella Pizza is to die for. Definitely worth trying. Be advised, it takes about 20-25 minutes to make b/c of the dough but it was worth it. Regular slices are delicious. In my opinion, one of the top 3 in the neighborhood. Looking forward to going back and trying a chicken or pasta dish."
1289,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Don't order from this place during the Super Bowl unless you're willing to wait 3 hours
1290,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I ordered a pie, an order of Mozzarela sticks and wanted a Rice Ball Parmaciana which they refuse to make. So I get a Rice Ball that is less than appetizing and an open sauce that spilled on my carpet. The Mozzarella sticks were well done and hard, and the cheese was stiff, not melted at all. The pizza was greasy and looked like cooked too long. I am sorry my kids and I had to eat this. My first and last order. The 55 minute  wait was a bit much, only 4 blocks away."
1291,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great selection of pizza! And all their food is consistently good!! We had the grandmas pizza today and it was great on all points!! I need to try more before a give a full review though.
1292,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I am giving it almost a 4.It is the closest type of pizza I would say represents quintessential nyc pizza, old school - it's the type of pizza I grew up on in the BX - thick crust and a bunch of cheese.  It is the type of pizza that people compare when they talk about the Chicago vs. NY Pizza wars.This is not your wood oven, thin crust, gourmet pizza that I have now have come to love, such as Grimaldi's in DUMBO/Brooklyn.The white pizza (extra garlic) and Sicilian slices are great.  I've only been here a few times and what I have tried I enjoyed.It about 10 mins off I-95 and you should make it a good tourist stop when passing by!  It also will give you a good feeling of what the real Bronx is like: don't worry, while it is definitely tough, the area is definitely a safe, family neighborhood."
1293,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Took over an hour for a slice and a hero to be delivered. The food was cold (not even slightly warm) when it arrived. We won't be ordering from here again.
1294,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Believe it or not I actually had a really hard time finding a pizza place that would deliver in the Bronx area.Pizza was exceptional (half pepperoni), but more importantly the customer service is really fantastic.They delivered on time AND reprinted my receipts 3x, weeks after my orders.  That takes patience/ a nice personality.Thank you!Corinne"
1295,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,I was looking around on Yelp about 3 weeks ago. I was Just tired of the same old pizza shop. I found this place. They have good rating so I decided to order. I wanted to go simple. It was my first time. I ordered chicken Parmesan with penne vodka. Of course I had add garlic bread. The portions are large. The food is absolutely amazing! The prices are great. The food comes very fast & hot. I order from here at least once a week now. Love it!
1296,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"LOVE this place!!! I choose them over Crosby pizza any day and I've been in this neighborhood for decades and this place is fairly new and it has quickly become the. Right or good pizza spot! From stopping in for a quick bite and unlimited refills on beverages to catering a party, Mangias is the best choice around! To top it off, the staff is super friendly and accommodating. If you've always wondered hmm I wonder how their food is.. try it!! You won't be sorry!!"
1297,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Pizza is good but if you want fast delivery, forget about it!  Stick with the pizza because their calamari is awful. most of the time by the time they deliver the pizza is cold and you'll have to warm it up. And if you call to complain about an item. don't count on getting your money back."
1298,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"One of my favorite pizza and casual Italian food choices in the area. Quick service and very good. The fettuccini Alfredo is very oily, and the garlic knots aren't particularly flavorful but everything else I've had is really good. Penne a la vodka, salads and pizza slices are decent. My husband loves the chicken and bacon pizza along with the buffalo chicken ranch pizza. Delivery is all quick and convenient."
1299,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Mangia's just opened this year, and the place looks really immaculate and bright, with colorful signage and friendly, inviting staff. New Yorkers have become real pizza snobs, the main reason being you can find a pizzeria on every block in every borough. As such, you really have to bring something different to the figurative and literal table. So how does Mangia's fare in the pizza glut? Well, it was a bit of thumbs up and thumbs down.Mangia's Brick Oven Pizza is a little misleading because I didn't see a brick oven anywhere in sight. Aside from that minor annoyance, it has a wide and varied menu, so we're not only talking pizza, but subs and pasta dishes as well (not to mention calzones, stromboli and pepperoni pinwheels, which looked really appetizing).  At the counter, there's a really gorgeous display of specialty pizzas; pies topped with vodka penne, chicken francese, chicken marsala, barbecue chicken, etc.  You get the gist.I normally stay away from these heavy specialty slices because I feel like it's not a pizza anymore.  Still, they looked really great so I splurged and got a chicken marsala slice along with a plain regular.  The chicken marsala slice was a surprise, as it tasted amazing -- tender breaded chicken with a tangy marsala wine sauce. And I have to give credit for the crust remaining crisp and crunchy to the bite. You have to eat this with a fork and knife because one slice is really a meal in itself. It was very heavy. 4 stars for the chicken marsala slice.Unfortunately I have to downgrade the regular slice. I'll give that the crust was crispy and firm - no problems there - but the sauce and cheese were subpar and bland.  The cheese tasted like chewy dough and the sauce didn't pair well at all. It tasted canned or something. Don't get me wrong, it's not inedible or awful by any means, but my expectations were set too high from the marsala slice.  And let's face it, this slice might hold its own in a suburb outside of Rome (Rome, New York, that is), but you're in the Bronx and you better have your shit down - especially when you have Louie & Ernie's only less than a half a mile from you."
1300,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Brand New pizzeria in the country club area of the Bronx, (where the Italians there try to hard to be Italian! ) anyway! This place is your normal pizzeria that makes dinner dishes! They're all over the place in the Bronx! Wht makes this place different is the authenticity of the food! For a pizzeria to make fresh quality dinner dishes equal to a trattoria is pretty good!! I was def surprised at the quality of the food, it was made fresh and everything seemed homemade ! From sauce to bread! The broccoli rabe something to rave about! It was heaven! And prb the best grilled chk and broc rabe I ever had!"
1301,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I had a really good slice, salad and baked ziti. The owner asked me how everything was and was very friendly. A welcome addition to the neighborhood."
1302,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,".It is making me write something , although i did not want to. Was disappointed in the food and the service last order . That is all I will say"
1303,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,First time I tried Mangia and the food was delicious.. Had the pasta primavera!  I recommend it !
1304,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Amazing, i go to school at WCC and i always stop at the bakery around the corner and i just happen to stop in for a slice, absolutely amazing. Best i've had down there.  Nice counter guy and good atmosphere"
1305,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,I ordered a tuna fish wrap   it was all lettuce and no tuna.   Paying 8 bucks for lettuce is disgusting
1306,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great gourmet pizza. Love the bbq chicken especially. The refills on fountain sodas are nice. Most of the workers are friendly and professional. Great food at good prices. I go there alot.
1307,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I've been ordering from here since it opened and it never disappoints. Food is always cooked fresh and deliver is always on time. I've tried their salads, wraps, pastas but my go to meal is their personal pies. It's the perfect size for 1-2 people."
1308,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Best place to order pizza. ...the chicken marsala pizza is a meal in itself. ...the Margherita pizza is excellent! Delivery is fast as well. .
1309,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Been coming here since they opened. Their food is great! They have tons of specialty slices and they are so good. My favorite is the chicken franchaise slice (yes slice!) so good!! I've also had their pasta carbonara and their pasta with sausage and broccoli rabe both delicious. As well as their regular slices. Highly recommend you check out their specialty slices though!!
1310,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great neighborhood place.   Pasta Fagioli is the best
1311,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great speciality slices! The BBQ chicken pizza is an absolute favorite. Slices are large and fresh. Delivery is pretty good and within 30-45 minutes depending on how busy they are.
1312,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Awesome pizza!  Ordered the meat lover's pizza delivery - while it was on the pricey side the food was really excellent.  The delivery guy came within the specified window, which was a reasonable 45 minutes after placing the order."
1313,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"$38 doen the toilet. ...I usually order from joes...I decided to try somewhere new...BIG mistake. ..the delivery bloke told me that it was good...lie..wings, cold..bland..greasy. ..pizza, swimming in grease snd super soggy....never going back...never..never...never....sorry Joe's. ..calling you tomorrow! !!"
1314,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Went back a second time in the same week. Enough said! LOL Very delicious and we haven't even tried the pizza yet. The Sicilian Panini was perfect as well as the pasta dishes we tried. We highly recommend Mangias!
1315,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Food is great. Fast delivery. I order at least 5 times a month and it's always well worth it.
1316,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"No complaints here! Great pizza by the slice, personal pies, brick oven, and love their garlic knots!"
1317,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I didn't used to believe in God. Then I tasted Mangia's Chicken Penne alla Vodka pizza and I realized: God absolutely must exist, because this pizza is nothing short of absolutely Heavenly. Seriously, the best slice of pizza I've ever had. And being a New Yorker, that's saying something. This is my new pizza spot. That's all that really needs to be said. Try it, I dare you."
1318,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Great Italian food.  You can't go wrong with anything you order.  Awesomely friendly staff.  The best part - THEY DELIVER.
1319,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"My father was raving about this place so I had to try it.  He had their chicken Parmesan the other day and was ordering something else today.   I just had their food today for the first time and I must say.  I am full, but my mouth wants to keep on eating!  I ordered the stuffed shells with garlic bread.  Since it was my first time ordering from here, I wanted to keep it simple, I mean, who will mess up stuffed shells?  Anyway,  the sauce is AMAZING!  I just wanted to drink it alone.  Lol.  My husband ordered a personal brick oven pizza and that was amazing as well.  The garlic bread was delicious too.   My stuffed shells came with a salad so I opted for the raspberry vinaigrette.   The dressing was great too.  We ordered our food to be delivered and it got here in a very decent amount of time, hot and fresh.  The girl that took my order was nice.    I registered for an online account to order online, but decided to call instead,  since I had registered online my info came up In their system so I didn't have to spell out my address using people's names as letters so that made life much easier lol.   This is my new favorite place.    Keep it up guys!  You're doing great."
1320,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Never disappointed with my orders, the chefs at this place really know what they're doing! Plus they have shrimp parm, good shrimp parm at a good price is hard to come by. Check them out, you'll be happy!!!!"
1321,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Okay I've ordered take out from this pizzeria several times but have never eaten in house. That being said the pizza is solid. Even though their plain pizza isn't anything to brag about they make it up with their specialties. Their chicken and vodka pizza is by far my favorite. If you could only have one pizza to try here and you like penne alla vodka then try the chicken and vodka..but if your not feeling adventurous id go for their Sicilian it's a little but better tasting and more filling (obviously) then the plain slice....prices are normal..food usually gets here within half hour..people on the phone are always nice..can't complain.
1322,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,first time i tried mangia's pizza - tried the philly cheesesteak pizza - absolutely delicious. loaded with meat and flavor. will definitely order again -
1323,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I had take-out, so I can't speak for the dining-in experience, but this pizza is *bland*. The cheese is thick and tasteless, the sauce tastes jarred, and the crust is slightly on the doughy side. With a combination like this, it still lacks flavor. I'd rather eat a box of saltines."
1324,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I was beyond excited to try out Mangias'!! However I am here to report this place is nowhere near the expected 5 stars. Walking in I was enticed by the aroma of the pizza only to see flies sitting upon the crust and a worker in the back swatting them away.  Correct me if I'm wrong but there such is such a thing as pest control?However the uncleanliness did not stop there. I saw a worker touching the money then the food. I would NOT be surprised if the board of health fined them AGAIN! Or none the less  shuts them down.I thought the obscure scene with the workers stopped there but trust me it did not. The girl behind the counter was rude to customers and was too busy flirting with the staff to take my order. I was livid. Would not recommend. The food was decent but horrible service just ruined everything. The unprofessionalism of this pizzeria is horrifying. Please don't waste your time or money. Such a shame because there was a lot of money invested there and the interior design is very nice, but the manager should have learned how to run this business first."
1325,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I gotta say I like this place, the people are really nice the prices are reasonable. You get a nice salad with bread for around 7 bucks and it's a nice size portion. The delivery is also fast, so if you live in the area and don't want to step out order in."
1326,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"The employees are so fast, friendly, and very informative! The pizza was great and there was defiantly a sense of pride. Though, I just wish the pizza was a tad crunchier :)"
1327,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,My buddy told me about this new restaurant and I figured I would give them a try to cater my tailgate yesterday at Giants Stadium. And let me say I did not regret the choice! The sausage and peppers were out of this world and possibly the best I've ever eaten.  We also got a tray each of the BBQ and buffalo wings that were delicious and breaded to perfection. A group of 7 of my buddies and I went into the stadium fully satisfied. On top of this the prices were very reasonable. I would highly recommend having Mangia's cater one of your events. You won't be disappointed. I look forward to  trying out some of their dinner dishes and pizza which I'm sure are of the same quality.
1328,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Love this place! Have been frequenting it since it opened and they never let me down.  Pizza is great, heroes are made exceptionally, salads are plentiful and people that work here are friendly."
1329,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"This place is fairly new and I decided to try out their pizza. In this part of the Bronx we have several excellent pizzerias to order from. The legendary Louie and Ernies and the always amazing Joe's Pizza. This place has a pizza that tastes like the old fashion slice I remember from back in the day in the old Italian pizzerias in the South Bronx. I like to call it the ghetto pizza, but not in a bad way. The sauce is a little sweeter and its a little cheesier, the way I remember the way pizza used to be. My wife had the pasta fagioli soup and she said it was above average. If you live anywhere near here try them out. They deliver and they take credit cards."
1330,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,I love this place the food is great and authentic the best pizza ive eaten in such a long time the food is always consistent and the people there are great if your in the area its a must have.
1331,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I tried this place a few times a week when they first opened, being I work across the street. The specialty slices are delicious, the plain slice is okay. The calzones I didn't like but the stromboli and the veggie stromboli are delicious. Thumbs up for the eggplant siciliana pasta dish, but the chicken parm is not that great. (I've noticed the specialty items taste better than the normal pizza menu items)It is very clean and the owner is really nice. They are a bit expensive. One thing that urks me and made me stop going (even though I will go back for specific items) is that they saw me and my co-workers everyday, sometimes even at night for dinner, and although they are very nice, they never gave us a break. Throw in a soda, or even a side of sauce without charging me the 50 cents. If my bill is $20.10, knock off the dime without me searching for one in my bag.  I feel that is how you make and keep a good customer!I decided to try it again last week, and after spending $6 on a veggie stromboli (which is delcious) they charged me for a side of sauce. There was one guy who works there (heavy set with glasses)  who dropped veggies off a slice onto the counter, and he picked them up with his hand and put it back onto the slice, which to me is a nono. The place is clean and so are they but that still bothered me.  So even though they are very nice, and the food is good, that makes me not want to go back."
1332,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Great pizza, but they're  not just pizza. The salads are mouth watering and the pasta is excellent as well. If you're in Pelham Bay looking for something fast and delicious to eat, this is your best choice."
1333,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Best pizza that I have had in a long time. It is very nicely renovated space, clean, all of the food on display looks fresh and delicious - I only give 4 stars bc I haven't tried any of the other food yet, however just a regular slice was perfect - nice crispy crust, lots of gooey mozzarella cheese, right amount of sauce."
1334,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Went to Mangia's with my husband & two of our friends. When we placed our order, the person behind the counter asked my husband's name -- even made a joke about it. While we waited for our food, the counter people would shout out, ""okay, who has the [insert menu item]?"" My friends' food comes about 45 minutes later. A few minutes later, my husband's food comes. An hour later, I still had not received my order!. My husband goes up the counter & asked where my food was. The counter guy tells him ""oh, that's not to go? It's been sitting over there"" & then points to paper bag that has my order in it. This pissed us off as while we were waiting for our food, they were yelling out orders or people's names. Never once did they do either! Naturally my food was cold, so I sent it back. They told me I'd have to wait 20 minutes so they could make a new one. TWENTY MINUTES AFTER ALREADY WAITING AN HOUR??? I DON'T THINK SO!! I ask for my money back & they tell me I have to wait for the owner. So I'm waiting & the owner finally comes over & asks what he can do? I tell him that waiting over an hour for our food is inexcusible. He agreed & actually said, ""you're not the only one that's complained."" So that makes it right??? Obviously you need a better system & if several people are complaining, you should come up with one on the spot. He asked what he could do. I told him after waiting so long I was very hungry & the least he could do is give me a slice of pizza to make up for it. While I'm waiting, my husband & our friend had given me some of their food. I get a slice & the cheese is literally falling off the slice. A few minutes later he comes by with the original order that I had waited now 1-1/2 hours for. Between eating everyone else's food, the slice of pizza, & the aggravation, I'm no longer hungry. The owner offers to take $5 off my meal. I tell the owner that I'm so disgusted by the experience that I just want my money back. He then THROWS MY MONEY AT ME!!"
1335,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Great food and a great price!  The staff is friendly the food is amazing and the place is very clean.  What more can one ask for.  This is my new ""hot spot""!  Will definitely tell all my friends about this gem!  The penne vodka slice is a meal in itself.....OUTSTANDING!"
1336,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"Very good place..Friendly staff and decent food..Dont taste like mama's food, but few places do..all in all a good experience last few times I been there..Lots of specialty slices..keep up with those..we like them"
1337,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"All I can say about Mangia's is WOW!!  I had the Chicken Marsala and my son Michael had the Chicken Scarparella, fresh as fresh can be.  Portion size ample and tasty. I drove over 40 minutes to try this place out, a friend of mine recommended it.  Well worth the trip.  Finished off a terrific meal with homemade cheesecake that the owner brought over for us to try.  Thank you so much for a delicious dinner, we will be back!!"
1338,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,Horrible service!!! I just place a order and the food is cold & not even cook correctly! Never ordering here again!
1339,6Q2W160rOqZc8YbOZSRyyw,"I'm giving Mangia's two stars because they really need to work out their kinks. Things seem very unorganized behind the counter. When I come in, I don't want to hear people shouting, pacing around and looking like they don't know what they're doing. The set up of the place is very appealing, however the cash register is in such an inconvenient spot. I placed an order with the counter guy and then he told me go around and the guy at the register will ring me up. I shouldn't have to relay my entire order twice to two different people. The few slices I have had varied in tase. Some were very good and some were soooo so soggy, I hate that. I believe that  if they learn how to run things smoothly than mangias will be a popular place but for now, twostars."
1340,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,I loveeeeee this place! I came in with my sister for lunch and the food is amazing. We both got a veggie burrito and it was so good. The rice had such a great flavor. The red and green salsa you get with the chips was delicious. The lady was really nice and polite. I def recommend this place! This place def deserves more than 3 and a half stars.
1341,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"Authentic Mexican! Hands down the best on this side of town! Always delivered promptly, with everything packed right & plated to perfection! Check out my pictures!"
1342,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,These fools try to finesse with the prices  and there steak is dryer then my knees and they will not give you your free soda plz don't waste your well earned dinero
1343,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"Terrible food. I called to returned the food and an idiot answer ""las cosas están caras "". There's no one to talk to in a complain and it's a waste of money!!!"
1344,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"Ordered chicken nachos, chicken burrito, and steak tacos, with coconut flan for pick up. Firstly, I love Mexican food so I was so excited to try all this food. Unfortunately, I didn't like the texture or the meat, it was chewy and rubbery. I found the all the food to be on the blandish side, especially for Mexican food and the salsa verde could not save it cause other than hot it was pretty bland too."
1345,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"If I could give it zero stars I would because the food wasn't authentic, the quesadilla had sour cream on the outside. They changed ownership and destroyed the restaurant, changed the menu and lost their clientele. Better go to nearby Tacos Bronco instead."
1346,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"I came by for some simple pico de gallo before the rockets/GSW game. What I got was basically a deli cup full of chopped onions. I had to doctor it up myself with some lemon juice, tomatoes, and salt before I could stomach it. It also didn't smell like the freshest onions. If they can't do a simple pico de gallo right, I'm scared to know what the rest of the food tastes like."
1347,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,I had the chicken nachos. Tasted pretty good. They kind of sprinkled the nachos with white shredded cheese along with sour sauce.
1348,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"Absolutely the best!! Awesome chef!! Authentic Mexican food. Super clean, excellent service and the food is delicious! The food is so fresh and tasty! They're affordable and the waitress is a doll. This place is really small but definitely a hidden gem. I come here for lunch all the time!! Love them!"
1349,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"This place has the worse service ever. Every time I order something, they purposely give me the wrong order. I ordered sopes and they gave me a flat taco. I'm a Californian and I know Mexican food."
1350,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"I decided to give the place another shot.  I saw it was on restaurants.com and got a coupon for it, so I went to the location and got a new waitress. They refused to take the coupon I had purchased from the website and the new waitress I got was neither very friendly nor helpful. Probably gonna go with the takeout if I even eat from them again.  They didn't tell us that they didn't accept the coupon until I tried to use it after spending the required amount of money. The beef in the dish with the cactus was completely overcooked and the mole sauce dish was just gross. Stick with the tacos."
1351,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,The place had very good food and good service. Unfortunately I need to take off 1 star because the jukebox is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO loud we were unable to even think let alone talk to each other because of it. I'll definitely order from here but I doubt i'll be eating in there again.
1352,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,Don't waste your money. The guy behind the counter (cook) is a jerk. He got my ordered wrong twice. I ask for red enchiladas and he gave me green.  I also ordered a sope and he gave me a flat taco. I'm from California and I know what Mexican food supposed to look and taste like. He treated me like I'm an idiot. Never ever again.
1353,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"I was pretty much resigned to the Mexican fare we were getting from Frescos Tacos (which ironically has WONDERFUL Sushi) but the Mexican food was bland. I live around the block from this place  passed it daily but never ventured in, until one day as I was passing, someone was leaving & the siren's song of fresh cilantro and grilled beef brought me right in. Long story short, between my husband & I we've had almost every entree, save the soups. THIS is authentic Mexican. Hand cut ingredients, everything fresh & well seasoned. Portions are good, prices are better. The Regular burrito is very filling. The Super comes with a side of black beans and rice. Flour tacos, soft or hard taste homemade, gorgeous nachos, and the spicy pork is mouth watering. I love Pelham pkw So. and I love it a bit more with this little gem. Call in & pick up, waits are long for delivering. ALSO: They have Mexican Coke, its different because it has sugar cane, not corn syrup. Much tastier!!"
1354,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"This is our favorite local Mexican take out.  It's authentic and delicious and reasonably priced. Favorites include the chicken enchiladas with salsa verde, and the nachos with chorizo.  Fast delivery and good food.  Only suggestion for the restaurant is an online menu and to put a paper menu in the bag when they deliver.  I lost the original and have been ordering our favorites ever since.  A few times I've asked, while ordering, for random Mexican dishes off the top of my head to no avail. But I love these guys so I'll still give them 5 star love."
1355,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"It's a small, simple, and clean Mexican restaurant. They have seating, but it's more of a take-out affair. I only gave it four stars because it probably won't amaze anyone, but they do what they do well. The food is consistently good and very reasonably priced. Why anyone would prefer to go to McDonalds or Taco Bell up the street is beyond me."
1356,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"I order my food from there and there food is great. I usually order sople and and they put put everything in it and their delivery service is very quick which is great, especially When you are hungry.I would recommend this place for their great food and quick service..must try it if you havent!!"
1357,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"Authentic, Authentic, Authentic.  Absolutely the best tortilla chips I have EVER had in my life!Salsa left a little bit to be desired, it tasted ketchupy.  But I got used to it.The food was great.Atmosphere was average.  We were the only English speaking people in this small restaurant, which was cool.Definitely recommended.Cash only."
1358,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,I hit this place up frequently. The tacos are great and the service is always awesome. Definitely recommend.
1359,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,My girlfriend and I ordered one Super Burrito to split and they gave us basically half a burrito on each plate with enough rice and beans for a full meal.  Also they gave us some really great chips and hot sauce too.  Even with a huge tip it was a great deal.  Friendly service.
1360,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"This restaurant opened today and we are definitely fans!  We ordered ""super"" chicken burritos and they were excellent.  The chicken was good quality, they're a generous portion and prices are right on target.  The red and green salsas are nice and spicy, just as they should be.  Service was a little slow, but I'm sure it will improve as they tighten up their operation.  Next time we go back, we will try the plates, tostadas or tacos and likely dine in.  There are five tables inside to sit in.  Until next time...we hope it gets even better!  :)"
1361,Gl13gO27l6HYZ9h1GWVNIA,"I am addicted to their ""chorizo taco americano"" it's a small authentic mexican food place. Food is delicious and service is friendly. I love it! I live across the street and its priced well that I eat dinner there everyday. The food is fresh and consistently delicious."
1362,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Finally, we found good sopes in New York. I was way too hungry to take a photo but the slopes were exactly what I've been craving since we left California. This is now my go-to sopes place. You won't be disappointed."
1363,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"The food was on time. The vegetarian burritos were great! My grandchildren were so pleased. In fact, they didn't know they were eating only vegetables...Bravo!"
1364,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,No comment!!!! The food was delivered in a timely manner. Can't really rate the food. I know I paid $29.29 for my order with a five dollar tip at the door.
1365,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Love this place!!! The guacamole is amazing and the service is super friendly and attentive. I'm not in this area enough to frequent this place, but it's well worth the trip to the East Bronx. Do it!"
1366,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,I love getting my tacos from here. This is our go to spot. The customer service is great as well as the food. I definitely recommend this restaurant hands down.
1367,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"One of the best Mexican food places in the Bronx.  Food is always freshly made, delivered on time and delicious. Coming from California, Mexican food is a hit or miss in NYC.  This place has not disappointed yet."
1368,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Terrible customer service when picking up food. Wouldn't accommodate a debit card paying customer for an online order that said pay in store, but distinguished cash."
1369,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Im only giving 3 stars becuse of their delivery service .... the food is good but theyre ddlivery times are horrible i literally live around the corner ans i normally pick it up but on rainy days i pay extra to have it delivered and they never come at the time the seamless order says which is always an hour or so shich is still a long time to wait for soup right around the corner ..so expect long wait times on delivery
1370,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Staff is so welcoming and friendly. The food is always fresh and made to order. Real authentic Mexican food. Best place in parkchester. Will continue to return. Try the Sopes! They're to die for!!
1371,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Delicious!!!!! Everything fresh and perfectly seasoned. Even accommodated my vegetarian tacos!!!! Great service too! Prices were pretty cheap to top it off!
1372,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Don't go here. I was stabbed there. Nothing but illegal immigrants with sharp knives.
1373,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Food - 1/5Delivery service - 1/5- The steak was rough and chewy and came in large, flat pieces. The sauce that it came in was watered down and not well seasoned.- The shrimp in garlic sauce was the biggest disappointment as we paid over 10$ for about 5 pieces of shrimp sitting in a grossly watered down paste of oil which had almost no flavor.- The spicy pork w/ pineapple sope was the better of the three mentioned above but it still was lacking any significant taste. The only reason I ate it all was because we threw out the steak and shrimp orders, and I was severely hungry.- Why not just add some sauce to the flavorless food, you may ask? Because they only gave us 1 small container of green sauce, which I'm assuming goes along with the sope but should have been included with all of their meals to at least cover it's blandness.- The french fries and the piece of flan we ordered were about the only good things in our order.Delivery:- They placed the order of shrimp in garlic sauce at the very bottom of the bag, so it got crushed, opened and spilled in the bag.- I gave simple delivery instructions to not ring the doorbell because people in the house were asleep. Instead I asked them to call the phone number on file which they ignored."
1374,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Yummy tacos & tostadas!  The delivery is fast. Definitely one of my favorite places to order from.
1375,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Food is great here, always has been; however, i dread calling for delivery because the guy who answers the phone is Overly friendly! Just take orders dude, stop flirting, it's uncomfortable & unprofessional."
1376,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"The food was ok, middle of the road. The red and green sauce they give is really good though."
1377,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"The customer service is good. The shrimp quesedilla is phenomenal. The shrimp is tender and delicious. The papaya shake was okay, it was very bland, it could use a pinch of sugar. I would go back to give it another shot."
1378,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"The guy at the front desk is rude , i came twice because I know people have bad days and i still got the same customer service , I ordered a cemita and i basically got bread and no meat , i also ordered a tamale which was burnt and tasted like it was cooked over and over everyday , not returning back rather go to the estrellita for the same price and better service"
1379,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,I just finished having by far the best Authentic Mexican food I've had in my entire life and I love Mexican food. My husband and I just ordered chicken and fish tacos with guacamole and chips. Everything tasted amazing and fresh. The guacamole must have just been made with how addictingly delicious it was. This was my second time having this place. My husband found it one night on his drive home and I had two chicken tacos. They were so good that even the spicy sauces they provided were good. My husband hates spicy food and he actually loved the sauce. I will be a loyal customer from now on. They have gained a customer FOR LIFE. Thank you for this wonderful food!
1380,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,DO NOT ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!  I ordered the chicken mole meal for and it was the worst thing I've seen!  They only gave two small pieces of chicken and the tiniest side order of or rice and beans!  On top of that it tasted bland and had NO FLAVOR!  I called to complain and I was told that with every chicken order they only send two pieces of chicken! I know times are hard but damn.  I just spent $23 for nothing!  I was also told when I called to complain that they would look into it and tell the kitchen not to send two small pieces of chicken if the pieces are too small!!  That still doesn't help me because I just paid for nothing!  I will NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE AGAIN!
1381,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"1 star is being generous I just finished ordering and receiving my delivery. They got here as promised but I will never be ordering from them again. I ordered a quesidilla with steak and didn't need the lettuce, tomato, or sour cream. What I got was some cold stead, on a cold tortilla with some cheese sprinkled. It was disgusting it was as if they had their youngest kid prepare it. Won't be ordering from them again."
1382,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Just got my tacos after i called 30-40 mins ago it came cold and taste horrible warm or cold ... worst service and food .. they use powder cheese no mozzarella or sour cream .. HONESTLY IM UPSET I PAID 14 FOR 4 TACO ...GARBAGE !!!!
1383,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Love the food here, fresh  and authentic.  Steak sandwich , sopes and tacos  are my favorite.  The service is good and the young man behind the counter is always pleasant."
1384,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"This place is great. First, the food - no frills Mexican. This is a basic Mexican place with Tacos, Tortas, some soups ect. I shared some steak tacos which were killer. They use homemade tortillas, and the meat was really well seasoned, with just the right amount of salt. I also had the guacamole which was really nice. Prices are good, and the owner is really nice. Go here."
1385,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Best Burritos in the area and for great prices can't go wrong. Food is fresh and service is top notch.
1386,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Hands-down, best Mexican food I've had in the Bronx. Fast delivery and great customer service. Can't ask for more."
1387,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Great in-store costumer service and delicious food! I ordered tacos al pastor, and spicy pork, tostadas de pollo, and burritos. All were delicious! Owners also seemed very dedicated to the business and to making sure I left a very happy customer!"
1388,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,This is my Mexican spot from now on. Reasonable wait time and friendly staff. Delicious and fresh too.
1389,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Love love love this place. I haven't tried alot from this place since I'm vegeterian and my options are limited, but they are such sweet people!! Service is great! They remember you if you order from them often and do their best to accommodate you.What I love the most is that they're so kind and always thank you for ordering and for showing support. The cutest thing ever! They make me smile every time :)"
1390,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Awesome place ....we always ordered dinner but one morning we stopped by and had there breakfast amazing the owner treats everyone well ......but hands down best pancakes !!! Yes I might sound crazy but give it a try you will thank me later !!!! For dinner we always ordered the flautas always great
1391,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Had the chicken enchilada and steak tacos. Unfortunately the meat was overcooked  for both. Their prices are a bit higher then other delivery places. Usually I don't mind paying more, but it should be worth it. It seems they are focused on being innovative (yelp deliveries) however they should focus on key ingredients and proper preporation of the food. Over cooked meat and ingredients thrown together is typically not good. Will not order from here again, as much as I like to order from small businesses."
1392,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Awesome in store and delivery customer service!! Their fiesta tacos and burritos are my go to orders here. Looking forward to trying other stuff from their menu
1393,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,The tacos were really good! I ordered the fiesta taco and it was delicious. I was a little further than they deliver but they were nice enough to bring me the food. The guacamole was also really good.
1394,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"This place is horrible!!!! I tried to order food for delivery and the guy on the phone was a complete asshole!!! I explain to him that this was my first time ordering and he just keep on rushing me, I cancelled the order because I couldn't believe how rude he was!! then he calls me back and insults me and leaves an angry voicemail telling me ""he hopes I die and that next time check the prices piece of shit"" who runs this business with that type of customer service !???"
1395,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Mexican restaurant that is very much authentic Mexican cuisine! Everything I have eaten is absolutely great. Service is a hit or miss. I normally eat the chorizo and egg for breakfast. At lunch or dinner I love the mole chicken which is even better than my grandmothers. This is real regional Mexican and might not work for people used to tex mex. Cost is minimal which is nice if you are on a budget.
1396,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,"Found this place searching for a new lunch spot after our daily team meetings. Co worker ordered Huaraches (open face taco) and orchata( rice water) and I ordered chili . I found the salsa to be on the uneventful side. The flavors in the beans were ok but it lacked pop like they were short on cilantro, oregano and cumin.The portion size was adequate. The decor and ambiance are not reasons to visit but perhaps other items on their menu are.Will give it a second try."
1397,ylKN_i-3bDdBf9nxULUMLw,Authentic Méxican food... is delicious!!! Staff members are polite and their door to door service is extremely fast... love this place!!
1398,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"I live across the street and his pizza and whole menu is absolutely delicious and to die for. Would highly recommend this place, and especially an extra cheesy pizza to go with it! Can't stop and won't stop coming back to this delicious pizza place!"
1399,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"I wanted to like this pizza, I really did. The guys in the shop were very sweet and the reviews were so good. But the pizza was not. Very salty, flat tasteless bread and overcooked cheese. Sorry Joe, I liked you but not this pizza."
1400,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Great nyc pizza  perfect pizza This is why nyc pizza is the best in the world. Great taste
1401,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Another excellent pizza from a guy named Joe. Great price, two slices and a drink for 6 bucks. What a deal, but even with the price these are among the best tasting slices I have ever eaten."
1402,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Even though I can't eat at Joe's anymore due to Celiac disease, my 9 year old son says it's the best pizza place he's ever eaten. I agree because back when I could eat there, I said the same thing."
1403,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"This is the BEST pizza ever!!! No joke, the best in the NATION. Like I can't rave enough about this place. How? Just how can such a simple slice have so much flavor??? This New York pizza is so thin and CRISPY, and the tomato sauce is so TANGY and robust and flavorful. They load such a healthy amount of cheese on top.I live in California but grew up eating Joe's some 25 years ago. I visit Manhattan annually and STILL make the 40 min-long trek to Joe's in the Bronx. Do not be fooled by 16 reviews. I have no idea why, maybe yelp is not big in this neighborhood? Listen to all these reviews if you actually read it...there's a reason why everyone says the same thing. They've grown up eating it and literally nothing else can beat it. Consistency and success at its finest."
1404,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Worst pizza ever. I tasted $5 pies better than this $2.25 a slice crap. And they leave their cooked pizzas on top of the oven while their doors are open like my mans theres flies on it before you heat it again. How gross
1405,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,This is probably one of the best pizza place of know. They have and do it all and it's a family business. So that's a  for me.  And they have Real Italian ice cream
1406,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Best pizza in this area and it's been here for years... the slices are mega huge (like for real.... they are like the original NYC size pizzas nyc is known for from back in the day). They zeppolis are absolutely delicious and a good price. If your in Parkchester and want a slice, go here!"
1407,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Best pizza ever! I went here as a child, but ever since i moved, I'd make my family visit the Bronx just to grab a slice... okay more than a slice. I've traveled all over New York, but the best pizza resides in Bronx at Joe's pizza."
1408,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,U can find pizza erywhere round deez parts but da homies at Joe's know how to throw down on dat dough. Holla. Lolz. Erythin was dope here. Dope sauce cheese and crust. All that. Thanks Joe.
1409,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"The pizza was great, definitely the best slice you can get for $2.50, the pizza had lots of  flavor, and the crust was divine. Plus with the garlic knots it makes a great meal. Definitely recommend it. But the napkins are just bad, it's tissue paper, but that's just a minor inconvenience. Overall great pizza, bad napkins."
1410,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Yes! it's good pizza. there's very little good food in this neighborhood, so go for it! Delivery man is a doll, too."
1411,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Best pizza on earth! Always fresh! The owner is very friendly. Great neighborhood pizza shop . Garlic knot amazing! Check in my book!!
1412,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Fantastic service!  Great food! My whole life THE BEST! Speedy delivery!  Received free order of ZAPPOLES with my order.  YOU'LL LOVE IT!  MANGIA!
1413,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,I've been going to this pizza place since I was a little girl and never has it changed throughout the years. The food is still awesome and I still feel that friendly vibe every time I go there.
1414,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Looking for good New York City pizza? Forget Manhattan or Brooklyn, head to the Bronx and get a slice at Joe's.  Whenever I'm in a pinch for dinner, Joe's is my first option. The pizza pies are always fresh and they are always ready in ""10 to 15 minutes"", like Joe always says. The chicken rolls always hit the spot, very cheesy and thick chicken slices. The actual establishment is clean and welcoming. Joe is always available to chat and tell great stories. Great pizza!"
1415,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Joe's is the pizza place around the corner in your neighborhood that you know will suffice your pizza fix whenever you need it. Awesome crust! A must in any pizza~
1416,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,I am a complete pizza brat from Brooklyn and I was skeptical about Bronx pizza. My husband took me here and it's the only pizza shop in the Bronx I will accept pizza from! Absolutely delicious! It's authentic pizza and the owner is super friendly and nice! I highly recommend this place!
1417,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Amazing pizza, garlic knots, zeppoles, etc. Highly recommended!!! Owner is great to deal with as we needed to serve volunteers at a nearby park. He delivered on time with hot food and we couldn't have asked for any better."
1418,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"Friendly, reasonable prices. Not too many pizza parlors left. If your tired of corp chain pizza places, I recommend Joe's"
1419,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Bronx staple. Original NY pizza spot. Friendly and knows customers. Great food my kid love the pizza rolls.
1420,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,Great pizza. The owner Joe is awesome and his pizza is always fresh. Reasonable priced.
1421,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,I'm surprised Joe's has only one review they're a neighborhood institution! They've been there over 30 years. A solid little pizza shop with the original owners. Sometimes the pizza could be better but it's one of the few authentic new york pizza spots that is left. It's sad to see them all go and to have such a tough time finding good pizza which is something I grew up on. Hope you stay around forever Joe's!
1422,IUaAfP_z-oexWnv_btakBQ,"whoa whoa whoa, you dont know about joes pizza??? where have you been? staple for me while i was growing up. even after i moved to the city, id make annual trips to the bronx just to have a slice of that crispy oily delicious joes pizza. even made my friends drive there for a slice. at first they thought i was on crack, but after having a slice they admitted that ""ok, its pretty good pizza"" eat it hot, its not the same if you take it o go. garlic knots are good too. forget the calzone, its not really known for that. dang, now i want a slice :("
1423,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This was on a Sunday at peak dinner time. Arrived at 6:30pm, I called around 5:30 and was already told it was possibly a 45min wait, so arriving and waiting for the rest of the party it ended up wait time wasnt too bad... staff basically said they coulda seated us almost immediately if our party was all there. After being seated, the staff was thorough and knowledgeable with the menu and was pretty attentive to beverage and water refills being how hectic and busy it was. We ordered 2 of the addicting cabbage appetizer (careful... it is addicting), and the Samurai which was to feed 4 according to the menu, there was plenty of food to go around we were able to finish, there was not any left overs but we were filled and not overly stuffed. It was my wife and I and my friend and his GF, we even had my daughter. The samurai dessert was a s'mores which was meant for 4, and the staff was nice enough to bring one extra for my daughter...(we didnt ask).IMOStaff: 10/10Food:9/10Price: Fair 8/10Environment:710"

1425,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I came here for dinner and good thing I made a reservation cause they were definitely packed! As you walk in, you get greeted by multiple staff members and the service was great. It's definitely a bustling spot that's loud but great for social dinners. My party and I got the Shogun deal and added beef tongue. It was super filling for the 5 of us, with all the appetizers and the delicious meats. They also change the grill often so that you don't get burnt meat. You get to grill your own meats to your preference but the staff also gives you a recommended time to grill each item. We got a few drinks like the mango mai tai and the berry smoothie with alcohol added in. I really liked the berry smoothie! The meal ended with s'mores which we had with vanilla ice cream, which was a great combo. Overall, great service and delicious food!"
1426,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Stopped in on a Thursday night at around 8:30 PM and had to wait an hour for a table for two. We didn't mind the wait though because we were able to grab a few happy hour drinks in the meantime. If you're wondering why there was still happy hour at 8:30 PM on a Thursday, it's okay because I was wondering the same thing. (Probably a business tactic if you ask me) but it was a business tactic that worked because we split a bottle of sake and a beer all for about $20. For dinner, we split a meat lovers combo which ended up being the perfect amount of food for two people. 10/10 would recommend the garlic fried rice. Our waiter was super attentive and overall I would definitely recommend this spot for some delicious Japanese BBQ"
1427,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"HH here starts at 10pm at the tiny bar area.  My lichee gin cocktail was yummy if not on the small side, HH apps were yummy. Free check in edamame from Yelp. The Japanese fried chicken was delicious, as well as the cold tofu. The fried calamari was a bit mushy tho.  Great service and Good HH hr choices."
1428,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Quite a good surprise. Never had Japanese BBQ before,  cooking procedures were explained by staff as well as different sauces and condiments. The beef was fresh and tasty. Service was excellent. We did a la carte menu because beef portions were just right and vegetables were fresh. A ""happy Hour"" menu would have been too much for us. We needed up going there for dinner due to close location to US open stadium. Would definitely go back if in he area."
1429,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Another gyu kaku location but always gives the consistent service and feel of any other location. Even tho a franchise I've always found the food and service to be nice. Not familiar with any other Japanese bbq location in flushing so this was a nice visit. Make sure u check in on yelp for a free edamame.
1430,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I had an awesome experience with my family at Gyu-Kaku, the food was really delicious and filling. The waitstaff, Palm and Miranda, were especially so attentive to our table. They made our dining a memorable experience in the best way. It was my mom's birthday and they were able to accommodate in getting us a candle, bringing it out, and singing to her! I would 100% come here again, best food and service I've experienced in a long time."
1431,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Went here on Valentine's Day. There's special Valentine's Day set but not that much better value than ordering your preferred meat separately. The service was good. The servers are very attentive and the food was served pretty quickly.
1432,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"A first for both me and my date - never been to a restaurant where you grill your own meats! Better late than never, though? Located on the 2nd floor of what is arguably the busiest intersection of Main Street in Flushing, finding good street parking will be near-impossible for you. There's a cheap parking garage about a block away, though!So glad I had made a reservation for 2pm on a Sunday, because it was PACKED. Our server was very patient with explaining the menu to us as newcomers, and we lucked out by arriving for happy hour without meaning to! $55 got us a whole combo package for 2 people which included appetizers plus 6 different types of marinated meats, an incredible deal.First off, I want to vouch for the quality of their beef - excellent cuts, cooked very quickly, and soOoOo flavorful. The sauces available at the table paired very well with everything, too, and never overpowered the original marinade. There was even a lot of food left over afterwards to take home!What a great experience, the interactive aspect will spice up any date if you're not in the mood for the same old traditional ""dinner night"" with a partner. Will recommend to all my friends and coworkers. :)"
1433,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,So after coming back (maaany more times) since their opening I have to say this is officially one of my favorite gyu kaku locations. They used to have all you can eat only 4 days a week but now offer it every day! The prices have gone up for the AYCE menu but it's still worth it. Quality of the meats is consistent and on par with other branches in the city. Service has gotten a lot better though sometimes it's pretty hard to find someone to change your grill. Gyu kaku Flushing is easily accessible by train but if you drive over be prepared to either pay for parking or roam the streets for free parking as the traffic in the area is terrible. Gyu kaku is a great place to go with large groups with an extensive menu for meat lovers! Always reserve a table online so that you don't have to wait when you get there though they do take walk ins.
1434,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"When I heard Gyu Kaku opened up a location flushing I was ecstatic! I frequent Gyu Kaku Times Square but having a location much closer to me meant I could satisfy my cravings without having to leave Queens. I reserved a table for two the day before and arrived 5 minutes early. It's really easy to miss the entrance and once you walk up the stairs you're greeted by a narrow walkway with the bathroom on one side and the hostess stand at the end of the walkway. We waited a good 5 minutes before anyone came downstairs to acknowledge our existence and then were told to wait another 10-15 minutes while they prepared a table for us. I thought the idea or reserving a table was so that I could be seated when I got there. Guess not. One star off. The upstairs space itself is much smaller than other gyu kaku locations and tables were pretty close to each other but it didn't really affect the dining experience. Their lunch menu and happy hour pricing are pretty similar to other locations but the portions were slightly smaller than other locations. Another star off. We ordered a bit too much food and had to take it to go - we ended up having to ask 3 different people for a to-go container 3 times each. Overall quality of the food is good, portion sizes are a bit off, staff was a bit scattered but there's room for improvement. I'll be back, and hopefully it'll match my experience at their other locations in the city."
1435,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I came here for Independence Day celebration and noticed that they now had a buffet menu. The last time I came, I was dissatisfied with the portions relative to the amount of food I received. But this time, the service was amazing and there was a wide variety of meats to select from and I actually left feeling full. Though it was still relatively pricey, It was a great experience and my party was happy with our decision.Taste: 9/10Service: 9.5/10Atmosphere / Hygiene: 9.5/10"
1436,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,It recommended you make reservations online . The wait here on a Friday nite is about 45 minutes . I will update this after 45 minutes when and if we get the table. We got our table about 10 minutes in . Our waiter was very informative told us what the menu on each of the book meant . He had recommendations on what we should get . We went with one of the specials that they had and everything that was in the bbq menu was delicious . We will surely be back here again
1437,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I've been to all the Gyu Kaku locations in NY and this one ...  I just wouldn't come back to. Unless all the other locations close down . I might consider it.Reservations were made a week in advance . So upon arrival we were 4 adults and 1 baby. We were told before being seated we must order in advance because their new policy is a table of 4+ must do so and we have 90mins to consume our food.. ummm ok whatever.. never heard of having to order food in advance prior to being seated before and other locations I frequent didn't implement this. I had no issues ordering in advance . It's cool cause I pretty much always order the same thing on the menu set the samurai (meats for 4) and a few a la cartes/shishito peppers/karate chicken etc.  But just weird . The food here is alright. Service is good. No complaints. Our waiter helped us cook the harami skirt steak. The rest of the meats were cooked on our own. They did tell us how long each meat were to be cooked.  Upon sitting the meats were piled onto the table. One after another . Our table was full. It felt very rushed....While we were cooking our own meat a few times the fire on the table went out... we had to flag down any available waiter to inform them of this. This was a turn off and I was on my way to losing my appetite and getting agitated. Ughs.Our waiter was nice. Was in good company so my experience here wasnt completely ruined.  However, YES HOWEVER . I probably and most likely would just travel further into the city to get a better dining experience and feel less of a rush."
1438,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Came here on a Tuesday around 7pm to try and get a table for 2and it was packed. We waited about 25 mins and were lucky enough to get a seat. The moment after we sat down I noticed the line got super long again so I suggest to definitely to make a reservation if you were decide to dine here.The establishment offered 3 options for all you can eat, or 2 set course meals, or you can order items on the menu if you don't want to do those choices.Me and my friend went with the $65 set meal and it was filling! We had fried chicken appetizers, edamame, miso soup, salad, and a selection of meats. I still can't forget how delicious their fried chicken/chicken karage still is ."
1439,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Wonderful food and service is excellent!!! Happy hour is everyday until 6pm. We had the two can eat happy hour special. The meat was fresh, tender and seasoned to perfection. They explained everything well, other servers checked on us in passing to ensure that we had a wonderful experience. We will definitely be back!!!"
1440,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Food was amazing me and my boyfriend couldn't even finish it all. Took the rest home.
1441,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Flushing is known for variety of Asian food and whether you're in restaurants or passing by street vendors, you'll notice BBQ is usually one of locals' favorite eats. With over 50+ franchise restaurants from far end of Hawaii to Canada to New York, Gyu-Kaku has made its marked in the heart of downtown Flushing. Gyu-Kaku offers multiple menu selections depending on time of day and individual-group's desires. There is an a la carte option for Appetizers, Noodles, Rice, Salad, Soup, Meat, Seafood and Vegetables, as well as Group Prix-Fixe. Lunch menu also provides additional options such as select 2 or 3 Protein Combo (with rice, soup and salad) or Eat-All-You-Can-Grill within 90 minutes.The service here is friendly and informative. Servers took the time to go over the time needed to grill each type of meat and to ensure diners get the best possible BBQ experience. Although the marinades used on the meat are not as flavorful compared to Korean BBQ, the joy of grillin' and eating with a group of friends with zero preparation... worth it!"
1442,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"So, I've wanted to try this out & so happy I did. It gets busy on the weekends & upon arriving I was told it would be about a 30min wait, which isn't bad, but luckily the wait was actually like 10mins! So once seated, we were advised of the all day happy hour & the waiter explained how the process works. My friend & I had the ""Gyu-Kaku"" BBQ course & the waiter explained how long to cook everything & etc.For Starters it consisted of Miso Soup, Gyu-Kaku salad(which is just a mixed green salad with tomato, eggs, cucumbers & dressing) Spicy Tuna Volcano & Beef Sukiyaki Bibimbap. For beverages I had the Forbidden Punch & Lychee Bellini & both were good. My friend had the Geisha & said it was good as well. For our main course we had Filet Mignon, short rib, skirt steak, shrimp w/ mushroom, chicken breast & a mushroom melody. All were seasoned to perfection & fulfilling. For dessert we had s'mores. The waiter was very professional, courteous & nice. For those who might be a pescatarian, there is seafood options, however it's not just a seafood option on one of the pre-fixe bbq courses. You would have to create your own variety of seafood. My overall experience is a 5 start rating. My only complaint is the bathroom situation. The bathroom is downstairs, which is only about 7 steps , but men & women both use the same bathroom. It's about 4 stalls & instead of having 4 stalls, they could've separated it & just have 2 bathrooms. Due to the bathroom door being tall, you don't know who's behind that door, so while I was just freshening up in the mirror, the door opens & it was a man behind me. It was alarming, because I wasn't expecting that. There also isn't a door to the actual bathroom space, it's like a short curtain, so the people waiting to be seated, can look right through."
1443,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"To be honest, my first impression of the shop when I first knew about it was not exactly great, due to the location of the shop itself. Obviously it's never great to judge a book by its cover. I decided to try Gyu-Kaku at the Flushing location today. Overall experience was awesome. With the short wait time, high quality of service, hospitality and heartwarming welcome from the staffs, it almost seemed as if it's a fine dining experience. Our server, Spencer, is extremely polite and patient. He greeted us upon arrival immediately. He explained the time for each meat to cook properly. He also is very attentive, fills our water whenever it's half way empty or asks us from time to time of anything to order. All the other servers that served us were also great and very patient.The meat quality is GREAT. We got the Ultimate AYCE menu. There were A LOT of options and cuts to choose from, as well as appetizer and rice dishes. The juicy and tender variety of meats definitely did not disappoint. Definitely will come back! Thank you for such this incredible experience!!!"
1444,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"We came all the way from Manhattan to eat here because of the amazing reviews! This place was worth the trip. We both went with the supreme AYCE option because we were both hungry and we didn't want to limit ourselves (who does?). The service here is amazing! Our server found out my friend was sick and offered several times to bring him hot tea with lemon. He was also very quick to change the grill for us and bring us the next order of food. Very attentive and even told us how long to cook the various meats per side. Also as other yelpers mentioned, the manager also came several times to check on us. Now to the meats, our favorites were definitely the harami and the prime kalbi short rib. Unfortunately they limit you to 1 order per person but it was perfect for us to try other stuff too. The harami comes in a clay put and the server actually cooks this one for you to your liking. I also really liked the duck breast and beef tongue a lot. The beef tongue was not chewy at all and thinly sliced."
1445,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Gyu-Kaku has to be one of my favorite restaurants to go and also introduce others to. My fiancé and I have been here on countless occasions and have never had a bad experience. The food is always great. Perfectly spiced and seasoned. The meats are always fresh and we always leave full. The staff here is knowledgeable and super friendly. Even as they get busy, someone will be by toMake sure that you're not left waiting too long. They are well versed I. Their menu and can read your cues very well, like when you're holding out ordering to start happy hour. Gyu-Kaku has a happy hour unlike most places. The drinks are poured with a heavy hand, and are mixed beautifully. Never had a drink that's too sweet or sugary here. Reservations are definitely needed during peak times, as your wait time can easily hit over an hour. And with many tables cooking their own food, it's hard to truly gauge how long you'll be waiting."
1446,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I was at this restaurant earlier today & because the dinning experience has made my day I'll review while it's still fresh. Everything was BOMB.com. The food, the service & the drinks! Surprisingly my server was a trainee, Miranda,  she did well! Miranda gave recommendations & was very attentive. We took advantage of the happy hour BBQ course supplementing pork for Teriyaki chicken. We added garlic shrimp & side of garlic butter. Literally everything was fresh & tasty! We ordered the Lychee Gin Mojito, Coco Mo & Forbidden Punch. The bartender Chris did his thing! The Lychee Mojito was refreshing &the Coco Mo was subtle & strong! Overall a great experience. I'll download the app to receive a discount for next visit!"
1447,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Mostly everything here is great, from the food to the service. However, this place is not elderly or child friendly. It is not handicap accessible, and the many levels of stairs can be pretty steep. In addition, they do not allow strollers to be be taken upstairs nor do they have a diaper changing station. P.S. you barely get any cellphone reception here and they do not have wi-fi."
1448,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Nom nom nom nom nom....i wish i could write this on the entire page!This place is awesome! The food is amazing and i had a great time cooking and enjoying my food.  So many things to chose from and definitely for the items in season-totally worth it.  I had the beef tongue and it was just as delicious as when i had it in Japan.  They really seasoned their meat well and i did not even need to add salt to anything. The staff is super friendly and makes sure you have all that you need.  Got the non alcoholic bev and it was on point!! Cross between piña and mojito! Yaaasssss! Even though i was riding solo, i made a reservation-this place packs quickly.  I am itching to go again and the beautiful thing is that i don't have to travel too far for great food."
1449,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Located in the heart of Main st., Flushing.Right above Red Bowl.I'm going to keep this review simple.Be prepared to spend around $30-$50 per person because the food isn't cheap. I'm quite disappointed with the portion ratio per cost, it's more on the slim side and it does not justify the price. I'll say one thing regarding to the food that's good, the quality is up there which is why my review is 4 stars.This establishment is great for moderate sized groups of 4-5. The service is phenomenal and I definitely recommend coming here....bring a fat wallet...."
1450,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Five stars for a chain restaurant? Yes! This particular location, service was excellent. They just made my visit so enjoyable.Gyu-Kaku is a chain restaurant with over 700 locations worldwide and majority of them are located in Japan. I remember being cheap and affordable yakiniku restaurant in Japan.They offer all you can eat from Monday to Thursday. Pretty good deal. Meat quality is not the best but not too bad for the price you pay. A server kept coming back to replace a BBQ grill mesh so many times. He was so attentive. A GM stopped by with a very nice smile to make sure we are well taken care of.It could get very loud just like typical Japanese izakaya, server screaming to say hi and place and order. Very clean inside. My clothes didn't get too smokey after being there for almost 90 minutes.I highly recommend making a reservation on open table as they were very busy on weekday night."
1451,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"When you walk up these stairs right off the main road in Flushing, I don't think you're ready for what awaits you inside. Staff are cheering, people are doing selfies with their food and it's quite the event. We get there at 9:00PM and are informed it's Happy Hour! The prices were unbeatable and the food was - hands down - fantastic. We ordered the teriyaki chicken breast, Edamame, zucchini, corn and a mango mojito. All great. It came to $30 for the both of us to have this amazing night cooking our own food and savoring every bite. A+Make sure to download the app and scan your receipt for points. Even if you just come the once- you'll earn a free dessert!"
1452,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I have been to many different Gyu-Kaku locations, and not just the ones in the city. I have even been to Gyu-Kaku overseas, in Taiwan, so I am definitely not new on the concept and have a pretty well rounded idea on how they operate. I made reservations for 7:15pm on a weekday and when I arrived there was no hostess. I waited for 5 minutes and decided to walk upstairs. The bartender saw my friend & I walk up and we obviously looked lost and he just proceeded to stand there. After 5 minutes, an employee approached us and I said I have reservations and gave her my name. She said she will be back and walked downstairs. When she came back up, she told me friend they don't allow outside drinks (she had a Starbucks drink) and I told her don't worry we will order cocktails but she still said my friend had to toss it. I understand not allowing outside food/drinks but if someone was going to order drinks, I would allow it (but whatever I don't own the place). So we sat down and the server greets us, I didn't understand what she said but she said it in a polite manner. We decided to order the AYCE Ultimate package which seemed like a good deal. It's actually a good deal for the restaurant bc I don't eat meat so I ordered the cheapest items. The apps came in a timely manner and then the meats came. Now this place is a bit sneaky, they don't serve you all the meat selections. Halfway thru our grilling, my friend said the shrimp and salmon wasn't served. No one came to check on us so we couldn't ask. The AYCE option says you have 90 minutes to order your food and after that you are cut off from ordering. At the almost 90 minute point, the server finally re-emerges and said our 90 minute ordering time is almost up and if we want anything else. I said we never got the seafood and she said b/c we ordered a lot, she didn't bring it out bc she thought we wouldn't want it (in other words they are cheap, they withhold your food hoping you won't remember) and then she asked if we wanted anything else. I said I'll take the s'mores dessert. Not even 5 minutes later, a woman who identified herself as the manager came and said she has another reservation waiting downstairs for a table and it's a big group so they need my table and the table next to us. She said because we been there since 7:15pm and it was almost 8:40 pm (even though there was 2 other tables that were there before we even got there that could both seat 10). Now Korean or Japanese BBQ isn't a meal you eat on the run, people need time. Especially if you are doing the cooking yourself. She even admitted the server failed to tell us she needed the table back at 8:50pm. I said fine give me the check bc quite frankly, the drinks sucked and the food was mediocre. The manager then had the nerve to scold me and said she will charge me next time for unfinished food. She asked me to leave before I was done, before I got the rest of my order, before I got my dessert and then threatened to charge me for un-finished food. Does that make sense? I don't even like to waste food so I would never intentionally over order but I wasn't going to eat every last crumb even if we weren't asked to leave our table early. I told her that's ridiculous and if she expected me to lick the plate. I'm not sure if there was a language barrier bc her English was poor but I found that whole lecture was absurd especially since you are asking me to leave before I finished eating because you didn't seat reservations accordingly. This location never changes the grill either, the entire time we were there it was only changed once bc I asked a male server if he could bc everything was burning. And even though the Mango Mai Thai & Geisha sucked, I was thirsty but no one ever came and asked if I wanted another drink. The bathroom downstairs also reeks of urine and is disgusting, even for Flushing standards. For $160, I expect the restaurant to let me finish my meal and for the manager to be competent. This location is going to give the rest a bad rep!"
1453,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Gyu-kaku in the heart of flushing. Now I don't have to travel to the city. The food is always great. The atmosphere is very lively and loud. If you come with a big party, make sure to make reservations in advance. There's usually a longer wait time for bigger parties. I couldn't be happier with their service. They are very attentive and are more than willingly to answer your questions/suggestions throughly. Will always come back here when I have the urge for Gyu-Kaku."
1454,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Service is good here but I feel like the prices are too high for the amount of meat they serve you. Honestly I would rather spend my money on a Korean bbq place because they give you more for a cheaper price, and it's authentic. I dont know what's the fuss in this place because everything it's overpriced. Yes it taste reallyyy good but you gotta keep ordering at least 10 plates of meat if you and your partner want to get full, check will come out to be over $100."
1455,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,A good place for Japanese style BBQ. Their sauce is sweet but taste good. Also their desert is also delicious.
1456,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Absolutely love this place! Recommended by my boyfriends friend; we had to stop in and check it out. This is our second time, Chris was our server both times and delivered each time. Chris was super attentive, the food was amazing and he always made sure our glasses were full and our grill fresh. The atmosphere is dim lighting with a good selection of music; great for a date night. *New date night spot*"
1457,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"During our trip to New York, a friend of my boyfriend suggested that we try Gyu-Kaku. Parking was kind of tricky but we managed to snag a space right across the street in front of Starbucks. We missed the time period for the AYCE deal but we did come during early happy hour so we still had dinner for a great deal. We were told that we had 2 hours to dine. We were sat quickly. We order the Happy Hour BBQ course for 2 for $55. It came with a lot of food: miso soup, salad, rice, edamame, veggies, chicken, pork belly, ribery, beef tar, and other beef items. It was well worth every penny. My only gripe was with the experience of cooking the meat. You have to be on top of the cooking times otherwise, you'll burn your food. It was hard to try to eat and cook at the same time because I would get distracted enjoying my food and forget I have something on the grill. Also, the servers have to change the grill grates after a while because food will start sticking. Waiting on them to come got a little annoying and also after changing it for the third time, he forgot to turn the fire back on.Overall, it was a great dinner experience and I saw they have a location in Virginia so I may try that one soon!"
1458,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"My to go spot for Japanese BBQ! Super yummy meat. After 9 pm, happy hours. Staff is friendly and super nice. Great for large groups so u can eat all type of meats!"
1459,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,I have been coming here for the last 8 months and the quality of food and service has always been the same...100. The staff has always been extremely accommodating  and pleasant.
1460,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Friendly staff, nice service, good quality food. I like they let customers cook their food so people can enjoy some privacy and take their time.Their spicy sauce taste so good, hope I can find a similar one from supermarket, lol."
1461,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Came here once with 2 other people and it was very expensive but amazing! You get your money's worth. We got the $40 per person meal plan and it was absolutely tasty. Will try to come back, but would prefer to come with a larger group."
1462,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The food here was divine ! I loved every bite. The service was great. The atmosphere was great. The food was great. Everything just great ! I will definitely come back. Keep in mind, you will not find parking because this are is so busy. You will have to park at a nearby lot which is not expensive at all."
1463,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I'm giving it 5 stars mainly for consistency. The food and meat here are essentially the same as midtown's/downtown/etc. Came here on a Monday evening around 7pm and was surprised there was still a little bit of a wait (~20 min) but no big deal. For a party of two we ordered the Gyu-Kaku ($75) and added japan menu Okonomiyaki- not your usual okonomiyaki but still pretty tasty, slightly salty side but not bad enough to drink a large cup of water; balance it with the other non salty stuff. The starter of the Gyu-Kaku were all pretty good, however, I did not care for the Spicy Tuna Volcano. The tuna itself wasn't flavorful enough (not spicy or salty really) on top of the fried rice ball (which is just fried, not salty) so it all together wasn't very tasty. Overall a good Gyu-Kaku experience with attentive waiters that are on top of it!"
1464,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,A spot that my girlfriend and I go to a lot. Especially during happy hour. You're able to cook your own food which is cool. The waiter instructs you how long you're suppose to cook and they are very friendly. The food is amazing and the service is amazing. Will always come back!!
1465,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Happy hour is the way to go!!! Have to say this location is by far the best! Our server Miranda is top notch, very attentive went way and beyond. Atmosphere and food was delicious!"
1466,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Their service is exceptional. We waited ~40 mins for a table for 2 on a Saturday night. All the staff are genuinely friendly and take the initiative to change your grill before you ask. We got the most basic bbq set for 2 which is really worth your money. There's a point you forget what cut of meat you are eating but as long as it tastes good, I'm ok with that. The s'mores is the most fun part and such an original/cute idea. The vents are along the side of the grill so there is better suctioning and your clothes don't smell as bad when you leave."
1467,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"My first experience with Japanese BBQ wasn't the greatest. The wait was long although I had a reservation.  The restaurant is super crowded which makes the waiters have to serve multiple tables which slowed down the speed of me being served accordingly. My family and I were super hungry and who wants to wait when your hangry lol! The portions for the price we paid was not worth it. 140$ plus tax for a party of four, NO BUENO! We were still hungry when dinner was over! Will not try this again....."
1468,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Yums, I have always had this bookmark, and was able to finally go. I got the meat lovers combo cus meat is awesome. The combo came with veggies, meat and s'mores. The meat was good and veggies were fresh. They have a buffet option, but I didn't try it. The service was very attention and they have a bar. They often have happy hour so things are like half of a dollar off. I recommend bringing a friend so you can share the food and have them grill for you!"
1469,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Don't have any food pics, went two times in one week. All with friends so i didn't take any food photos while I was there But: this place is great except for the waiting time Saturday Called ahead of time for reservations. They are all booked until 8:30 for the night.  So we did walk-in around 6. The wait time is 1 hour. There is a meet fresh across the street if you are going to copper square one. Tried combo for both time I went, we tried meat lovers ($69) and the Kobe ($120) I felt like Kobe has more meat than meat lovers. Meat lovers is not enough for two even though it is a two person portion.Kobe combo came with complementary Lady M cake and ice-cream!!!! Highly recommended!!!They do have ponzu sauce, sweet soy and chili.Recommend ponzu sauce, it's sourness could calm down the greasiness of too much meat.The atmosphere is wonderful, dim light, dark wood tables and silver cutlery.Service is great, they change your grid way too often lmao. (3 times in one hour ) I would come here again dinner"
1470,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Japanese bbq for lunch on a weekend is the best thing! We went their for their happy hour. $50 for 2, what a great deal! The place is huge, nice interior and we got seated right away. We ordered two virgin drinks and its not included in the happy hour. They have a lot of happy hour choices but we pick the $50 for 2 that comes with miso soup, edamame, salad, 2 rice, bistro hanger steak, toro beef, yaki shabu pork belly, garlic chicken, assorted vegestable and s'mores for desserts. Miso soup is miso soup, edamame is good and a little soft, salad was okay because its that asian salad you know. All the meat was really tasty and well marinated. For $50 its a steal! Glad they have the happy hour on a weekends too. Fast service, friendly waitress and delicious bbq!"
1471,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I went this place for 4 times. Always have great experience.Service is very good and food is good, too.Only one dish is too salty to me. It's the a beef with lots of garlic sauce on it.Other than that, perfect!"
1472,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Mon-Thurs all you can eat for $39.99 or $49.99. Everyone on the table have to do AYCE. Happy hour is until 6pm, but is all night at the bar. The premium meats are to die for. If you do the ultimate package, you get two orders of tongue and premium steak per person. All other items are unlimited. The tongue was the favorite meat. Service is amazing. They change the plate for you before you have to ask. The manager comes and asks if we are doing okay and if they need to improve in anything. Just amazing staff and premium meats."
1473,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,I had so much fun here and the food was absolutely DELICIOUS! I went with a group of friends during our Christmas gift exchange it was the perfect place to do it. It was about 5 of us and it was plenty room. We went late too around closing time and the staff was great about seating us and we didn't feel rushed. They even offered to bring us two drinks at once to participate in the happy hour since the bar was closing. I recommend this place for groups or even a date. It's fun and interactive. The prices are so cheap during happy hour which seems like it's always happy hour but just check. Again. Super cheap and good. The food is filling. I'd definitely go to this establishment again and again and again. My table pretty much every thing off the menu and everyone enjoyed their food. I had chicken and shrimp with veggies super good. The drinks were sooo good as well and the bartender didn't have a light hand haha. They have so many locations soIt's great. This location in particular was nice. Everything was clean and the staff was very helpful and patience.
1474,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"You've tried Korean bbq, but have you ever had Japanese bbq or yakitor. Boasting over 700 locations worldwide, this chain bbq restaurant is a meat lovers paradise. Since opening in flushing, there has been many new introductions to the menu including options for the vegetarians and ramen noodles. And yes there is an all you can eat menu in tares priced $35.99 and above. The meats are super flavorful and if you need more you can always use the ponzu and hot sauce. The service was excellent and the grills were changed often for a supreme grilling experience. Enjoy"
1475,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Guaranteed a good experience hereThe servers always ask if you've been here before and explain how long to cook each meat. They're friendly and attentive, yet not breathing over your shoulder. They bring the food quickly and change the grill often! If they're busy, you can ask and they will do it right away, never with attitude. Food is always great because you can cook yourself and it brings everyone at the table a little closer. If you download the app, you can rack up points for rewards!"
1476,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I really haven't been around Main St Flushing in a minute, so I was surprised when my girlfriend told me about this place right above what used to be Red Bowl (which to my surprise, is closed down now?). Parking was not good because they ALSO closed down the municipal parking lot right next door and replaced it with a brand spankin' new apartment building. There's a late happy hour special everyday after 9pm there which is great! That includes HH prices for drinks, bar foods, and some BBQ combos. I got a regular blue moon draft ($4.50) and also a Mega Mug Sapporo ($8), which seemed like a better deal afterwards due to the size of the mug! We shared the Happy Hour Combo special for $50. The meats were very well marinated and I highly recommend dipping them with their house ""spicy"" sauce. In my opinion, I felt like the sauce  made the food much more better because of the sweet and tangy taste it gave my food. The combo was a good deal because it pretty much gave you everything you'd want to try; from miso soup + salad to meat and vegetable plates and of course, ending the meal with s'mores dessert."
1477,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Long wait without a reservation! But the food is delicious!!!!! Would go again. Oh wear light clothing the place is warm because of the grills
1478,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The best best BEST resturant experience I have ever gone through. I was always so scared of BBQS in general, but Gyu-Kaku really made me overcome that and actually enjoy it. My boyfriend and I made reservations for a Monday at 8:00PM. We were seated upon our arrival and waited about 3 minutes upstairs around the bar. As we walked in, the atomsphere was amazing and families/friends were having a great time. The menu had various choices of which meat platters to choose from, as well as AYCE. The AYCE is Mon-Thurs all day and I believe Fri-Sun also has one but different times. The AYCE however only lasts 90 minutes. We got the second option of AYCE which had so many appetizers, meats, soups, sides and yes...dessert!!Our server, Danny, was very accomdating, polite and informative. He told us about the sauces, the meats, how long to cook them for and if we needed anything more!It was our 4 year anniversary dinner, they put a candle in our dessert which was so sweet!! The manager even walked over our table and granted us many more years to come. This was honestly the best meal I have ever had."
1479,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Happy hour!  Before 6pm and after 9pm. Prices were good, grilled meat and squid were good. Even enjoyed the smores for dessert - it was apt because the grill was still warm enough to melt the marshmallows. Service was great. No wonder my brother likes going back there and told us about it.  Only complaint is the small grill so with a group of 8, cooking in small batches meant waiting a bit for the next serving. Also the person, who was busy cooking, forgot to eat at times. (That was me when my kids were younger. I cooked and left kind of hungry).  Will return here though."
1480,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Alright...One tip to start, ALWAYS see how their menu have changed. My family (including my 3 yr old nephew) and I love gyukaku and we come every 3 to 4 weeks. Their menus and specials are always changing. This time, I tried their AYCE premium menu and I was pleasantly surprised. Seniors are half price, kids under 6(?) Are free. This is a great deal for families. Selections in their AYCE menu is also quite good!Tip #2: happy hour (early and late) are also great deals. And the drinks are half price all night at the bar"
1481,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Came here for my bestie's birthday. It was very convenient to book through open table and had plenty of tables when I arrived for dinner. Upon arrival, the host was ready to greet us and had everything set up for us. Unlike the Manhattan locations, this location actually had way better customer service and such high energy!The waiter came to us quickly and introduced himself and also explained the menu to us when we requested to do a AYCE option. YES... They have AYCE here! There's 2 options (Ultimate $50 or regular $35 I think). If you're feeling a little adventurous, definitely go for the ultimate option. The only rule to this is, each person is only allowed to order 2 protein dishes each order. Fair enough as I can see the food sitting there if we don't eat quickly.Quality of the meat is amazing! Just gotta put it out there... They also did a birthday song while bringing the dessert out. Lesson learned... Don't bring a cake to a AYCE !Washrooms are located downstairs from the restaurant where the host station is. They accept credit cards. Manager and waiters are very attentive!"
1482,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Here are some notes: (Had a really good time, btw): Was surprised about the All You Can Eat Menus- they have 3 different packages: $39.00, $49.00, $59.00. We got the $49.00 package but we would've been fine with the smaller one. Just note, the smaller package does not include the Salmon, noodles, and some varieties of beef. And if you are dining with anyone else and someone orders the All You Can Eat, everyone must get it. The Salmon was delicious though. There was NOTHING that we didn't like.We told the waiter that we were a ""pork free"" table but he forgot that the Shrimp Shumai was made with pork juice. My hubby had to spit his out .Other than that- great place for birthdays or special occasions."
1483,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Very fun !! Food very good !! I have a really nice experience!! This is a perfect place to go with a group !!
1484,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Went back to give them another chance. Went on a Saturday when they opened and they had a few open spots on arrival. Service was a lot better. We had a new girl who was still in training and she did a wonderful job. Food was good. Price was ok. Will def be going back.
1485,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Been here before when they opened. Good food but small place. This time we had an online reservation but they didn't honor the time slot. Made a 7:45PM reservation and made us wait over 40 mins. We had to leave. People kept going before us. If you planning on going make sure to go super early and with a small party.
1486,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Honestly I was contemplating rather I should give it a 3 or a 4 star, but in the end I decided w a 3 star. When we arrived the hostess quoted 5-10 mins, in the end we waited for over 10 mins (no big deal since we didn't wait for more than 20 mins) but when we entered the dining area there was a few empty tables so I don't get why they couldn't seat us.Our server was initially friendly and nice, he explained the menu, how everything work, and answered all of our questions. But toward the end of our meal, everything went downhill. He was nowhere to be seen (maybe Bc we sat at the front entrance and the rest of the customers were at the far side of the resto). It was so hard to flag down a server to get the check or their attention, initially we wanted to order one more meat dish to grill but in the end after waiting for OVER 15 mins we decided to just end the meal. The sauces that they provided on the table are ponzu, sweet shoyu, and spicy. My personal fav is the ponzu when you dip the meats (it is citrusy) but without the meat my fav is spicy. The spicy one reminds me of the Thai sweet and spicy sauce. Spicy tuna volcano - it was an ok appetizer, I saw on yelp and the menu that it is a popular and was also craving for spicy tuna so we ordered. Couldn't taste the spiciness on the tuna and the fried rice can stuck on your teeth (BE AWARE!) 3/5Garlic fried rice - this was so goooooood! Phenomenal. Nice aroma of garlic, MUST TRY! 5/5Overall, it was a nice experience but I hope they step up the game w the service Bc it was unacceptable. Like I get how the resto can be busy but it is ridiculous when I see servers passing by back and forth and no one notices that we wanted to order (the wait can make a customer lose their appetite.) would come back again tho Bc of the garlic fried rice and the sauces for the meats.-2 stars for the service"
1487,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"It was my first time here yesterday and I had a great time here. We had made a reservation and we were seated almost immediately. Some places despite making a reservation, you have to wait. First they have combos for people like us because we weren't sure too what to order. We got the gyu kaku set which included soup, salad, 2 appetizer dishes, 4? Different types of meats and s'mores for dessert.Everyone was so friendly and attentive- they explained how long we should cook the meats for, etc. Second- We didn't know we had to keep the mushrooms in the foil so we took it out and started grilling it and it started sticking to the grill so the waiter came by and offered to rewrap it for us haha (I apologized a million times cause I felt so dumb and felt so bad he had to rewrap it) He was so nice about it and even apologized to us because of the miscommunication! Third- The manager? I think stopped by our table and asked us about our experience and if we were happy with the service which we 100% was. Everyone was so professional and moved mountains to keep us happy. At the end we got to make our own s'mores while enjoying our wine. It was really busy and packed but they never rushed us. I would definitely come back here. I want to bring my parents here so they can experience the great food and environment."
1488,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This was Japanese BBQ place and my friend and I ordered  gyu-kaku: 70 dollar meal plus tip and tax round up to $90dollars for two person. The meat especially the beef was very tender from the 70dollar combo suitable for two ppl. The gyu-kaku BBQ items have 4 starters: 2 miso soup, salad, 4 pieces of sushi, and a huge beef bibimap!! This is very filling already!!!Also have 6 BBQ items included: 4 different kinds of meat and mushroom and shrimpAnd also included dessert included called s'mores ( this is cracker with chocolate and melted marshmallows) and of course you melt the marshmallows yourself!!! Tats the fun part!!!I would definitely revisit!"
1489,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Family dinner spot. big and spacious. Attentive and friendly service. Meat quality is good, extensive menu with buffet style and regular order style. Happy hour is awesome! I  will suggest make a reservation, even weekdays are super busy too."
1490,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I went here last night for dinner.  This place was packed! I recommend taking an Uber here because parking is terrible...but that is Main Street for you! It is located on the second floor and there is a small waiting area while waiting for a table but I recommend getting a drink at the bar.  The staff was very accommodating and came to get me when my table was ready.  I had the meat lovers special for two which consisted of a wide variety of different meats, edamame, miso soup, salad, and s'mores for dessert.  I also had warm sake with the meal.  Our waitress was very friendly and consistently changed the grates when we were cooking our meat.  That is another thing! You cook your own meat here so be prepared for some grilling! Overall this place is a hidden gem and I recommend it!! The food was tasty and the service was great!"
1491,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Having been to a few of the GyuKaku in the city, this is my favorite not only because it's so close to home but also because of the staff. I've been there a few times and the waiters are always so friendly and knowledgeable. I tend to make a reservation on Opentable just in case there's a long wait. After all it's Flushing and on my last visit it was poppin' on a Tuesday night!The waiting area is small but there are extra seats near the bar. It's a much smaller restaurant than the other GyuKakus. I haven't eaten at the bar because I love to grill the bbq items so I prefer table seating. The lunch menus are great and you can get the most bang for your buck. It includes a soup, salad, 2 or 3 meats and rice for like $13. There's also happy hour menus at two different times so you can definitely take advantage of cheaper alcohol and some meats/appetizers. Currently there's an all you can eat menu with three different tiers, I believe the one that allows you to order everything is $39.99 a person. It's also cheaper for children and seniors.  On my last visit, I had Ke as my server and he was overwhelming kind and upbeat. He went through the whole menu, explained the sauces, how to cook the items, and just in general gave us some tips even though we had been recurring guests. Previous visits, I had good experiences with all the other server as well. Food wise, I'd recommend the harami, which is one of the more expensive meats. For the appetizers, I always get the GyuKaku salad and the spicy tuna avocado volcanoes. I haven't really tried the duck which was a newer item on the menu. For dessert, they've got s'mores and lady M crepe cake. Overall, food and service is great!"
1492,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The service at this place was really great. The meats came out quick, the servers were all really helpful and gave great recommendations. The ayce option is expensive but is probably worth it if you have a larger party so you can order more variety of meat. Their ramen is also great and cheap so don't skip out on that! Quality of the meats were really good! I recommend the sirloin, skirt steak and pork belly. They also had a premium sauce that the server brought over and that was the best dipping sauce. Would definitely come again with a bigger party and try the ayce option!"
1493,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I love this place ive been to the location on 2nd ave, and its definitely lived up to my expectations. Friendly staff, good food and great happy hour drinks.Came here for a friends birthday it was about 10 of us the staff was very Attentive, and explained everything. We had an amazing time and will definitely be back"
1494,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The best Japanese bbq ever! My friends and I got the premium all-you-can-eat for $39 each person. It was absolutely worth it because all the meat tasted so good and you can order as much as you want for an hour and a half. The waiters are really friendly and know their stuff, they always let you know how long to cook the meat for. Dessert is included in the ayce and the s'mores just make the whole meal 10x better. I'm waiting for the next time I can go again."
1495,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Trying ordering by the plate instead of the pre-sets, excited to eat a variety of meats"
1496,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This is my second time to have dinner here. However the service they provided tonight was so much worse than my last time. Waiters kept wasting my time during the whole dinner. Every time I wanted to order more meats or added some water or changed a plate or something, I hardly could find my waiter. Did they just wanted to reduce the times of services so that I could leave as soon as possible? Is it because I came in at 9:25 pm and they knew that I am having a time-limited buffet, so waiter felt upset or something? They really did not care about how the customers feel. They even would not ask you if you want to change your plate or add some water or something unless you ask them by yourself. Moreover, I kept asking them to give me a white rice at least three times, but they still didn't give me. Even when I asked them to give me the check, they still waste my half hour to get it. Why did they need half hour to get a check? How hard it was? And in the end, some of the meats were really not fresh but they still forced me to eat the steak otherwise they would require me to pay this.What a ridiculous restaurant, 100% I will not come again."
1497,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,The menu has a lot of stuff to look over so it took me a while to see if I was getting the best deal for what I wanted to eat. They had an all you can eat option which I didn't think I was hungry enough for. They also have pre-fixe meals which I should've opted for but I wanted specific meats that weren't on there. Instead I made my own combo and was satisfied but definitely could have eaten more. The miso wings were the least favorite part of my meal which I shouldn't have ordered because that's not apart of the bbq experience anyway. We loved the way all of our meats were seasoned & cooking them ourselves they were cooked to the right temperature so there was little room for error on the restaurants end. The lady M matcha cake at the end was the best sweet ending. I would go back just for the cake alone
1498,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"If you experience a wait it's soo worth it! This place has the BEST service I've ever seen in a place. The manager not only helps the staff to keep things moving but he comes to each table and asks how everything is. The meat is top of the line, totally fresh and seasoned very well. If you are taken back by the prices believe me it's TOTALLY worth it! U have to try the lady M cake."
1499,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"We love Gyu-kaku but this is the first location in NY we've tried. This location is located on the second floor, so be ready to walk up a flight of stairs. Apparently, their menu have changed some. There's an AYCE menu, some items removed like the lamb, and some drink changes, according to the server. We opted for the lunch menu and some other side add-ons. All were spot on. We always enjoy Gyu-kaku!"
1500,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Amazing experience here. Went with a group of seven got seated fairly fast considering we did make a reservation. They do time you which I'm not crazy about but I don't mind being the timer was set for two hours which I believe is a good amount of time. The food was amazing we got the shogun and samurai because why not. Can't think of any item I didn't like. And their server were amazing very attentive check very often to make sure we were good and had water. Also knew all the drinks in details that's a plus. Would definitely recommend to anyone.
1501,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"If you want good bbq, go to a nearby korean bbq spot! If you're just hungry and want to eat, it's a good, affordable spot to try. In all honesty, the beef here were mediocre and nothing to get excited for but our waiter (Jackie) was exceptional! I would've returned just for him but the management has no common sense. The staff in general were all very nice but I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone. Do NOT get tempted to order the Wagyu that's straight from japan (oOoooOO) but if you do, it comes frozen so make sure fire is turned low before laying on and the salt and pepper on the frozen slabs has no purpose either so make sure you sprinkle a little after. The price for the amount you get is good compared to other restaurants. The hanger, sirloin, and short rib were the best out of everything we tried and for almost $11 an order, I'd say it's affordable. Regarding my experience with management: I attempted to book 2.5 weeks in advance for a birthday party solely on the fact that our waiter was so excellent (really, food was not that great) but the manager seems to think their restaurant was way above my experience and wouldn't accommodate my party of 25+. I thought it was a poor business call so I dare to say quote me in a few months when their business fails if they don't change their ways!!!"
1502,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Our server Jacky was exceptional! He made sure my friend and I had a grand ol' time. I usually visit the Gyu Kaku in Manhattan (38 Cooper Square) but I think I found my favorite location. Plus it's local! I had no idea they had one in queens. It's a little out of the way since it's in flushing but it beats commuting an hour and change to the city. The food was delicious and savory. The lights went out and the whole place was dim for like 5-8 minutes. The manager came around and reassured us if the power didn't come back on, that he would have his male associates escort us down the stairs after our meal. How sweet! I appreciated the thoughtfulness of management."
1503,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The servers are great and the food is good too, kids were excited for dessert very honest and good space the only complaint I have is we waited a long time for our seats but the restaurant has 3-5 free tables, I understand they may have reservation but it was empty for a while"
1504,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"My favorite location is probably the flushing one. Staff service and friendliness is impeccable. Love the food here from the different marinated meats, to sauces, and drinks. Youre definitely paying for quality, and they have nice lunch time deals.They even sing for birthdays and can hold the cake if you bring one prior to the reservation!"
1505,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The food is so flavorful and tender , I love that you get to cook it yourself. Our waiter Tim was specifically phenomenal but all the wait staff are so nice and accommodating!"
1506,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This place is probably my five year old's favorite restaurant. She has a lot of really severe food allergies so it's a huge treat to her to be able to sit down with us at a restaurant and eat the same food we do. It's the only restaurant she's asked us repeatedly to go to. The food is always good at Gyu-Kaku so that's never been something I've been concerned with. I believe what makes this location shine (at least for us!) is their respect and sensitivity when we inform them of my daughter's allergies. They never act like it's an inconvenience and are very proactive in handling it (e.g. letting us know that the kitchen staff always change gloves when preparing my daughter's food without us asking; all staff taking our orders and serving our food know beforehand of her allergies after we let the initial server know). My daughter's had anaphylactic reactions to beef, wheat, and sesame in the past and has never had an issue with eating at this location.We typically opt for the supreme AYCE (not always available so double check before you go). There are three tiers of AYCE but only the supreme level has the duck that my daughter loves. Drinks are great too so we often try to make reservations during happy hour as well."
1507,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"We spotted this location a few weeks ago and it got me all excited! I've never been to Gyu-Kakus in the city but I've loved dining at locations in SoCal. I called and inquired about reservations around 6 pm on Father's Day and was told the earliest reservation they had was 9:15 pm with a 9:30 pm last call and a 10 pm closing. My husband said to go for it so we did.We're still not very familiar with the area so I looked up parking ahead of time. We knew that from before, it's mostly parallel parking with heavy pedestrian traffic. My husband would rather pay to park in a lot and be done with it than search for cheaper street parking. The closest lot I found was on 136-18 41st Ave.This location is located on the second floor; I didn't see any elevators. You come to an initial landing where the hostess' podium and restrooms are. Then up another flight of stairs to where the bar and main dining areas are situated. The hostesses offered for us to sit at the bar while we waited since we arrived early. The lychee-tini, mango lemonade, and Asahi were on point. You could order food at the bar as well but we opted out.Service everywhere was great, including from our server Chris. He knew the menu well, which is great when you have a particular husband and a kid with tons of food allergies. We requested plain chicken for my daughter and when it came out sprinkled with sesame seeds (she's allergic), they were quick to apologize and fix it right away. We initially ordered the mixed veggies for our daughter assuming they'd be plain, but they'd all been marinated in shoyu (she has a wheat allergy as well) so we just ate them ourselves. Pretty much all of the meat is marinated so if you have a wheat allergy, I'd say you'll probably have a bland time. We also ordered the French fries. Husband wasn't a fan of the dipping sauce it came with. I liked it - reminded me a little of kewpie mayo. The bowls of plain rice were more generous than I thought. One would've been enough to split between me and our kid. We got our first order of food around 9:37 pm so I was worried about missing last call already, but Chris reassured us that it wouldn't be a problem ordering more food again soon. My daughter has a beef allergy as well (I know, I know - eating out with us is so fun). We try to stay away from places where you grill your own meat because ventilation is poor sometimes and her eczema flares up; however, we had absolutely no problems at this particular Gyu-Kaku. Her skin didn't get worse, everything had been wiped down clean, and us parents enjoyed a nice dinner.My husband's only gripe is that he can probably devour a whole cow by himself so the cost to serving size ratio hurts his feelings. He ordered a beef sukiyaki bibimbap to fill himself up. We downloaded the Gyu-Kaku app for rewards points because we'll definitely be back."
1508,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"My first time here and boy was I skeptical! When we arrived, we were immediately seated... however where we were sitting was FREEZING! Thankfully though, our waiter Victor, was very accommodating and asked to have the AC lowered.It was happy hour also when we arrived. I ordered the Rum Punch (playing it safe)... and it was pretty good! We ordered The Samurai, which feeds 4 people and to be honest all 4 of us were FULL by the end!... Each and every meat that was brought out, (except for the skirt steak, which Victor cooked for us half way), we cooked on the grill and it was AMAZING! I was not disappointed one bit!! Nice place And heck yea I'll be back!"
1509,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Went last night for dinner with a group of 6. We did the $190 shogun dinner for the group and added an extra noodle dish. I thought the garlic noodle and bibimbop portion could have been a little larger. They seemed pretty small but overall very nice dinner, and the server was great. Meat quality was very good and tasty. Would definitely return again and try other items on the menu."
1510,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I wasn't a fan of Gyu-Kaku the first time I had it, although their Happy Hour drink prices are pretty damn amazing. I decided to give it another try when my friends wanted to try this ""hot new restaurant"" in Downtown Flushing, and I was hoping that its location away from the city meant better quality and better value. Came here with 2 other friends and we weren't super hungry to begin with, so we ordered the Kobe style set, which is usually intended for 2 people. We all got our fair share of each course and even if we were a group of 2, we'd only eat just a bit more of what we had. Although I am a fan of Kobe beef, I didn't think it was anything special. The meat quality was good, but portions felt small. Then again, I'm generally not a fan of BBQ sets because the portions always feel small and being a carnivore, there never seems to be enough meat.Our waiter was very attentive and came and changed our grill rack often and brought out our food very quickly. The service, in general, is overtly friendly--I really admire the staff's high energy and (very) super enthusiasm when greeting guests in and out. I'd be dead tired by 8pm on a Saturday.My impression of Gyu-Kaku still stands: decent quality but very expensive, small-portioned food. Their Happy Hour deals, on the other hand, are worth going for but I'm not sure if I'd pay full price for their drinks or food unless, of course, some friends want to go."
1511,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,food was so delicious and portion of the AYCE is huge. Employees are also very nice. I will recommend to family and friends. Go Gyu-Kaku Flushing!
1512,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Food comes out quickly and staff is attentive and changes grills quickly. Would definitely recommend.
1513,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"It's a nice place, but it's not the best. They maintain the Korean BBQ theme well, but they don't offer the side toppings like most places I go. It's inconvenient that the bathroom is downstairs as well. The food isn't as flavor packed like other places I've been."
1514,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The service was amazing!! The food was pretty good. We went on a Thursday and went for the All You Can Eat. There was plenty to pick from.  The manager stoped by our table to make sure that we were having a good time and that the service was on point, which it was!!!!"
1515,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants. Their meat is so perfect and sweet and savory. I LOVE the service here -- everyone is always so happy and kind! Their happy hour deals are also so good.I always come here after 9pm when happy hour starts. The place is pretty pricey so any deal is a good deal. I recommend calling ahead since sometimes it gets busy and I have had to wait 45 minutes before. The place is a little cramped in terms of design but once you get into your booth, there is ample space. Overall the service and food really compensate for the pricing. Japanese BBQ is typically expensive to start with, and this place is decently priced for what it is offering. I don't think I can ever think of a time when I could say no to coming here, even tho I hate flushing."
1516,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Honestly would love to give 5 stars but they need more grills. When there are more then 4 people at a table it almost impossible to get everyone's food cooked. You are mainly waiting your turn and if you do all you can eat you have a time limit. So sometimes you leave still hungry. They only have 1 large table for groups but that is always taken. Also they need to dust the lamps above the tables. As we grill the food and the heat rises the dust falls down onto the table. I go there often but it does stop me from bringing more family/friends with me because of the grill situation. The perfect amount of people per table/grill is 2, especially when you do the all you can eat.The staff are all friendly and helpful. I love going here."
1517,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"First time visiting a Japanese BBQ restaurant . I'm a big meat eater so I'm very picky when It comes to my beef. My friends had hyped this place up so I was a little disappointed when my meal had ended. I ordered one of the combos that included 6 different meats. The quality was ok nothing to brag about. I did like both salads, and the kids meals were a nice treat. I would come back but it wouldn't be on the top of my list."
1518,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This place is an embodiment of a perfect Japanese bbq that has actually contributed a lot to my personal perception of bbq. It's just wow, and you don't compromise when you go there: everything is great.In more details, we went to the restaurant with my wife to celebrate our wedding anniversary and reserved the table in advance. There was not wait for this reason and everyone greeted us in a way you feel like you are really welcomed (and they don't overdo it).My wife and I ordered Japanese wagyu beef, Harami skirt, Prime kalbi steak, toro beef, 2 other types of beef, kalimari/squid, and a lot of veggies. Actually, the vegetables felt so perfect that I (who usually doesn't care about anything but protein in the bbq places initialed ordering more onion and zucchini. Overall advice for people who are in the place for the first time: the more diverse your order is, the better. Although Japanese wagyu costs $55, my favorite was a skirt steak and some other beef type that was much more chewy but extremely flavorful. So wagyu for me was more like a filled checkbox, but the more lean marinated beef turned out to be the star of the show, especially in combination with vegetables.  This place is definitely five stars."
1519,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I have been to this place three times and has gotten worse experience each time. Service was decent during each visit. Portion was adequate. The problem was with the food, especially the meat. Most recently, we got the Gyukaku set dinner for two. All the meat except maybe one cut/dish was really tough to chew even though we only cooked it to medium rare. Maybe my standards have heightened after visiting Japan but for this price (~$90 all in, with no drinks), I probably won't visit any time again soon."
1520,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I was super excited that there was a gyukaku opening in flushing, I've been to their locations in the city and really liked the food.  But the experience here was not as good as other locations, I guess I went here on an off day (Sunday afternoon).So first off, don't open the left door... that leads to a downstairs kitchen of some sort, make sure to stay on the right.  Would be good to put a sign to indicate the right door.It will lead you to a set of stairs.  Upon entering the hostess wasn't present, when she returned she asked if we had a reservation (which I didn't) so we ended up waiting an additional 10-15 minutes.  But the thing is, majority of the restaurant was empty and we were seated in an awkward location, a shared table that could seat 8 for a party of 2...?  Didn't really make sense.Usually upon arrival, staff would happily yell welcome or ""Irasshaimase!""  But instead staff yelled ""irasshaimase....."" it wasn't enthusiastic as other locations, and frankly they seemed really tired.Food:Spicy tuna volcano- tasted good, the seasoning of the rice itself reminded me of jia leurng (the fried dough wrapped in rice noodle), but the crunchy rice was a bit hard to chew... this seems to be a popular item but I wasn't a fan.  I guess this depends on personal preference. Addicting cucumber-didn't taste the same as the other locations, but it was okay.  Maybe it was a different sesame oil but the sauce wasn't as great.Sukiyaki bibimbap-they readily offered korean mild and spicy, mild wasn't spicy at all.  Overall the taste just wasnt there like other places.Bistro hanger steak/Yaki shabu beef/Prime garlic shoyu steak- extremely seasoned, maybe marinated for too long or the ratio of seasoning was off.  Usually the meats are lightly marinated and it would've been okay to use the provided ponzu/light soy/spicy sauces at the table.  But there was so much seasoning that using the table sauces woukd be going overboard.Pork belly- slices were not ideal for grilling, usually for grilling pork belly you try to aim to crisp up the edge a bit.Lychee lemonade- neutral?  Tasted a bit like sprite mixed with lychee jellies, if you like that combo this might be for you.Our server was really nice, sometimes it was a bit hard to get him due to our seating area.  But he was doing his best to tend to us.  We were sat at the further end of the shared table that wasn't easily viewed (there was a partition that obstructs the view).He was really good at explaining the grill times, menus, etc.  He also offered hand wipes at the end and a promo card with a secret freebie for next visit, I like those types of offers since they're pretty fun.While leaving, usually someone would say thanks/come again/etc, but all the staff just stared as we left.  We also saw the hostess looking upset and tearing up for some reason...Overall, I'll give it a bit more time before returning, manager and waiter often asked how everything was so I know they're trying their best.  For now I rather take the trip to the city for my gyukaku fix."
1521,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The food here was absolutely amazing! From our waitress Pang to the top quality portions of our entree. We went during happy hour on a Wednesday night, so worth it! We ordered the gyu-kaku for $70. Definitely worth every penny! We also ordered 4-5 drinks & our bill came up to $120.00. I would totally recommend this place to anyone who is looking for a cool experience for an affordable price."
1522,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Love that place! One of my go-to restaurants! Great fast service, amazing food! I like to come in for happy hour which is pretty much all day long"
1523,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I came here this past Friday on the 27th with two of my girlfriends to celebrate my birthday. I am literally in love with this place. I come all the time not just to this location but all there other locations in NYC. It is always an amazing dining experience not just because you can grill your own meat but because the staff is always very helpful and amazing. From setting up a reservation, to getting seated and ordering our food. We made a reservation for 9 and that's when they have the late night happy hour. I would check their website for the happy hour times because they may be different at other locations. They have prix-fixe courses available on the menu or you can order a la carte. We went for the meat lovers course and added another miso soup because we were 3 people, the course is usually meant for 2. We added a side sukiyaki bibimbap rice with beef. ITS IS A MUST. It's so good. They have the option of mild or spicy, I always get spicy. We also ordered a side of the spicy tuna volcano as well.  And is it really a birthday if you don't celebrate with alcohol? Lol but we had a couple rounds of the San ""Gyu"" Ria. Absolutely delicious, always my go to. Our server Ian was fantastic and gave us a splendid dinning experience. It was one of my friends first time here, and he explained how the grilling works and the menu. He was very attentive to our needs and gave us suggestions about what we were ordering, if it weren't for him we would have probably ordered too much food. I hate not finishing my food, one because it's a waste and two because it's just so great it'd be a shame not to eat it all. When I tell you the food here is so amazing, I'm not exaggerating and not to be dramatic but my mouth literally waters as I'm waiting for the meat to finish grilling. It's so good that while my friends were staring at our server Ian because they thought he was very cute, and while I admit that as well, I couldn't keep my eyes off the grill waiting for the meat to finish so I can devour it. Because food is life. 15/10 experience. They also did a little nice birthday shoutout at the end of our dinner, the staff is very into it, which makes you feel special on your day."
1524,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Everyone here is super friendly and the food is always on point. Plus we love when we get to cook our own food but, then again who doesn't. Lol I highly recommend this place for Korean bbq!!!"
1525,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Great place, friendly service, delicious food.  We got to our table 15 mins before happy hour ended so we got to order from the happy hour menu which was a great deal for two people.  The waiter was very helpful in explaining the menu and we didn't felt rushed.  He gave us time to decide and provided some recommendations.  When the food came to us, we were provided directions as to how long it should take for each type of meat to cook.  Our waiter was always quick to replace the grill after every used. Lady M cake is available while supplies last.  They only had the coconut flavor left when we got to dessert.  The only thing about this place when we came in was that we were given 90 mins to finish because they claimed to be packed but there were empty tables before and after we ate.  We couldn't fully enjoy ourselves since we were keeping tracked of time but it turns out that 90 mins is just enough for two people."
1526,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Oh my gosh does this place have so many deals! And I would say it is worth it. They offer a lot of variety bbq wise at least. And drinks! Gotta point out the drinks!!They also provide all you can eat bbq but certain days I believe. I went with a group of four and we did the $60 combo that's originally for two and we got full. Now I know this is a chain. I had gyu kaku in Chicago before. I remember liking Chicago's more for some reason. Everything was good but some I didn't care about. Service was cool. We came around the time they opened. Hostess didn't even know we were standing there but she was nice. Waitor was super cool. All the staff was really nice actually. Super informative. Super helpful and outgoing and laid back at the same time. The interior is nice also. Cute date night seen. It wasn't busy going around lunch time on Saturday. You have to go up stairs to get up to the restaurant. I probably would have preferred to try another place but the cheapest option and I didn't want get too full
1527,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"We were there for Thanksgiving dinner. We make a reservation and the front desk seats us promptly. The service were fast without making you feels rush. The front desk did says that its 90 mins per table since its pretty busy but then again depending on what you ordered, by the time the meat is cooked it takes more than that. We ordered the Meat Lovers Combo & The Samurai. Our server Chris were very good. He walked us through the menus and serve the foods accordingly. First the drinks , then the appetizers followed by the meat and finally s'more as dessert. The grill were changed constantly by him and his fellow teammates. And each time a server brings something they will let u know what it is and how long to grill each item. Very helpful and informative. We will most definitely come back again."
1528,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The meats and service here are AMAZING. Every single thing that we've ordered is delicious. So far, I've only been able to do the a la carte menus, but I do want to go back to do the AYCE option! I especially love how helpful and honest the waiters/waitresses have been! I love that they change the grill often so you don't have any leftover residue from the previous meats. I'll definitely be coming back here often!"
1529,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The food is delicious, the staff is super friendly, why not 5 stars? You're almost there really, but why are the portions of meat so small!? Well not small, but smaller. The grill itself is smaller. Because the portions are smaller, you have to order more to get full. And that hits you in the wallet. But this is not a place to gorge yourself on meat, even though they have an all you can eat option, this is a place where you can eat in a civilized manner and have dessert elsewhere in Flushing, because there are dessert places in Flushing. The cuts and quality of meat is very good and you will not be disappointed. Just don't wear your stretchy pants and expect to stuff yourself silly with meat."
1530,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Omg this place is so cool, can't wait to go back I the food was good and the prices where too (went during happy hour) got so many diff meats and veggies for two people and dessert think we spent like $70 together"
1531,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,If you love BBQ this is the place to be. The staff was great and patient with us. We had a reservation and changed it on the management team 3 times as it is difficult to get a large group together. Once we got there the staff explained everything to us and the manager accommodated us because some of our kids don't eat everything. Portions are just right for a buffet. Must have s'mores as a dessert
1532,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Today, I and my cousins went to this location. This is the second time and the last! We ordered the holiday special for $160 and an order of the special $13 beer pitch. When it came down to pay, our waitress collected my card and came back to me asking me for my pin. At first, I was so confused, because normally when you go to restaurants they have the ability to just swipe cards. I used this same card the last time I went in July 2018. I got the fraud alert on my phone and called my bank they released the lift. I felt it shouldn't have gotten to that point and this was the first time I ever had to physically go to the pos and put my pin in. I had them try it three times while the representative stayed on the phone. Nobody else had to endure this, and I'm 100% sure other people were using debit cards as well while we were there. Beware, if your young black customers going late at night. Be mindful you might be discriminated."
1533,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,This is one the list for one of my favorite restaurants.The service was great the food tasted incredible. The setting and vibe the everything about this place was just perfect and i most definitely recommend to everyone. This is also a great place for a family dinner or even a birthday. I also wanna add i don't like beef but i tried the harami beef and fell in love. Their mochi was really good too!
1534,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This review is a focus on their AYCE, which is Monday through Thursday. But they are super crowded on the weekend even without their all you can eat menu selection. Because I've only had non-AYCE here once... on the weekend and it was full house... from waiting, bar, to dining.... I've been here multiple times and experienced the before and after price hike...and still worth it! Still love it! From their service to their food and drinks...just good vibes all around.They have a very friendly and outgoing crew for staff on the floor. And I've had the pleasure of meeting and speaking with their managers as well: Koyo, Kay, and general manager Charles as well. Any problems, they resolved it with a smile, they visited the table every visit and would converse and welcome feedbacks and suggestions, just great experiences every time. Highly recommended!!Example:At about 7:40pm on a Monday... The estimated wait time was an hour and thirty minutes when we spoke with the host. However, we were seated at about 8:25PM.832pm finished placing our food order with Jackie and by 842pm about half the food is on the table, with the drinks. (Highly recommend Jackie as a server as well, because he brought us everything ordered, nothing was missing or forgotten.) Food: some meat selections on the AYCE menu is sliced so thin it's better for shabu shabu than BBQ, because it sticks on the grill and tears apart :(FYI: *Only four meat orders can be placed at a time.*Happy hour all day at the bar only...Otherwise, after 9pm from the dinner table.*Make your reservations asap...because Same day reservations cant be taken within two hours. (Unless they aren't busy at all...which doesnt really happen...always popular, therefore busy!) And they only take two large parties on the weekends.*They accept up to four credit cards per table, so large groups get cash ready!!* Manhattan location near time sq. had some drink options not available at this location.* Get their app before you go, esp. if you are a new user....give it over 5 hours prior to be safe and you'll get a $10 off $30 offer. And you get to collect points every time you dine, just remember to ask them to split the receipts so everyone can get their own points for their account - Each receipt can only be scanned once for points. * They don't have wifi but you can use the wifi from starbucks across the street. *Most of their tables seats four people, even if you're dining alone, you'll get a big comfortable table all to yourself. ( First come first serve !)"
1535,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,First time to Japanese bbq and the experience is good. I like that the grill has a build in exhaust fan which not too much or no smoke come out. It won't make you cloths smelly. The meat quality is excellent and prepared well. The staff is well trained and know their meat and prepare time. Over all experience is good
1536,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Amazinggg! I made a reservation at 9:30PM and waited for about 10 minutes for them to set our table. I thought the restaurant was quite small but it extends all the way to the back. The table is very spacious and the seats are very comfy. Our waiter, Danny was very accommodating, gave us great recommendations and would service us in a timely manner. My boyfriend and I decided to go for the happy hour for 2 meal set and as for drinks: Tokyo Sunset and Mango Mai-Tai. I ate at the Manhattan location a few years back and it seems like they changed their menu a bit but it did not disappoint at all. For starters we had miso soup, a Gyu-Kaku salad, steamed chili shrimp dumplings, fried bacon chips and beef sukiyaki bibimbap. The dumplings were pretty good - not sure if it is freshly made in store but the chili on top was very tasty. The fried bacon strips was interesting, it came with lemon and salt on the side. I didn't think it needed the extra salt but it tastes a bit like fried chicken ... maybe from the batter they fried it in. The bibimbap was also very good and a good portion to share amongst two people. We ordered a Spicy Tuna Volcano in addition since this appetizer seems popular. It was nice and crunchy on the outside of the rice and topped with just the right amount of spicy tuna. I think I will prefer the rice block to be a bit smaller in size and a bit more crunchy. Other than that, it was a great appetizer!For BBQ, we had the Harami Miso Skirt Steak, Bistro Hanger Steak & Toro Beef Soy first. All meats were very good and I liked how we can cook base son our preference even though the waiters advise you beforehand on how long you should cook your meat. Next was the garlic shoyu chicken thigh, pork belly white soy and spinach garlic. We didn't enjoy eating the chicken, it was tasteless and wasn't as juicy as the beef dishes. The pork belly was okay, we still preferred the beef. The spinach was surprisingly very good. It was also very easy to cook. We ordered a Kalbi Short Rib in addition to our meal and it's probably our favorite beef slice amongst all. Lastly, we had S'mores that came with the meal as well as the fried banana cheesecake with ice-cream. The S'mores was such a fun and cute idea. The banana cheesecake was okay, I didn't enjoy it that much since I'm not into banana flavored things but my boyfriend enjoyed it ~ I did like the ice-cream a lot though! We managed to finish all our food but we walked out SO STUFFED. It's definitely a nice, chill place to have dinner. Don't forget to check-in on yelp for a free bowl of edamame!"
1537,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"First I'll start by saying of love the Gyu Kaku brand. I've never had a poor experience at any of their New York locations.I must say the Flushing location is my favorite. The atmosphere is lively and the staff are friendly and attentive. No matter what time of day you go it is great service and the meat always taste fresh. I love that they have set courses because their large menu can be hard to navigate. Great for dates, hanging out with friends or even drinks with coworkers.It's the perfect dinner spot."
1538,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Wow, what a great experience. The entire staff is amazing & super friendly. Our servers Chris & Shek were extremely knowledgeable & had great recommendations. We made it just in time for the happy hour special, which is a combo of appetizers, assorted vegetables, rice & meat & chicken dishes. & to top it off s'mores for dessert. All for 50! & it tasted amazing. The manager, Dennis, even passed by to make sure everything was ok. It was my first time here but I will 100% be back!"
1539,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"The husband and I came here for our lunch date last Friday afternoon. We heard this location opened up not too long ago and have been meaning to come here to try since we've had it at the Cooper Square location before.There was NO WAIT whatsoever. I think partially because it was a weekday and in the afternoon. There were plenty of empty tables when we got there. No reservations needed. Phew. We were afraid of that since we had a doctor's appointment scheduled right after lunch.We opt for the *Premium Party Course* ($40 for 2 people) from the lunch special because we wanted Kobe Style BBQ meat!STARTERS & SIDES:-Salad x2-Miso Soup x2Rice x2BBQ ITEMS:-Kobe Style Bistro Hanger Steak Miso-Kobe Style Sirloin Steak Sweet Soy-New York Strip Steak Garlic-Pork Belly White Soy-Assorted VegetablesDESSERT:-S'mores x2TIP: Get FREE Edamame when you follow Gyu-Kaku on Instagram or like their FB page! You might have to remind them a few times that you liked their FB page because we did and didn't get the Edamame until later later later on. Humph. Anyhow , the salad was a fantastic kick starter!! Love the delicious dressing and the spring mix is super fresh! The miso soup was great, not too bland or salty. Seaweed and tofu tasted good too.The white rice was a bit hard and rough, tasted as if it was put in the reheat setting for too long. I think I was expecting the softer Korean rice, but we are in a Japanese restaurant. Shrugs.The Kobe style BBQ meat was overall good. I was not too crazy over the pork belly since there was an after taste to it. I also didn't really like the NY strip steak either because it was not marinated like the rest of the meat.We did not care much for the vegetables. We only got like 2 rolls of onions, 2 pieces of mushrooms, 2 slices of red peppers, and 2 slices of cucumbers. Meh.The s'mores were a nice end to our meal. Yummy toasted marshmallows on top of Hershey chocolate with crunchy graham crackers!***I think our biggest complaint was they split our orders of meat/vegetables in half and the second half did not come until after we finished eating the first half. Since it is self-service aka we grill the food by ourselves, we expected everything to be on the table for us to grill at our leisure. We were also on a time constraint so we did not finish our lunch until 1.5 hours later. Sigh to the slow raw food delivery.Other than that, it was a nice grilling experience. Well, the husband did all the legwork while I sit back and enjoyed the eating hehe. I love me a husband that takes charge!"
1540,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"I made a reservation for 7:45pm, however, was seated at 8:02pm.  The place was packed for a Monday evening and the hostess said that the table that was occupying our reservation was there for 3 hours that's why there was such a delay.  The staff was apologetic for the delay but it didn't change the fact that we had to wait excess of 15 minutes with a reservation. I came here with a party of 6 people and ordered the set for 6 people.  The food was good and the service was amazing.  Our waiters name was Brandon and he was so attentive and helpful.  His service and attitude was definitely a 5 star in my books.  He came by to constantly change the grill when it got a bit charred and to refill our water.  I wasn't quite full from this set for 6 people and we ordered extra items too. We ordered garlic noodles, bibimbap and 2 veggies.  I didn't leave here feeling hungry but I also didn't leave feeling full.  Happy hour is at 9pm to closing, which makes the drinks almost half off.  I would definitely come back here in the future and hope to have Brandon as my server.  Great overall experience for a restaurant that has only been opened for 3 months."
1541,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"This restaurant was fun and certainly delicious. It is fairly pricy but they do have full course meal options so you get to try lots of different items. Anyone watch Silicon Valley? Russ asks Richard if he likes beef... I would imagine the beef they ate is similar to the beef they were eating in that scene lol serious marbling and very tasty. Pork belly was amazing and try the beef tongue, you will thank me. I am thinking this would be a great date spot!"
1542,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"We came to this Flushing location for the first time after going to the one in the city for years. We weren't expecting great service or a grab vibe and atmosphere. We were very wrong.  We dare say it one ups the one in the city.  We got the Samurai which was enough for the 4 of us.  The meats are not the very highest quality but for the variety, seasoning and price, you just can't beat it.  We liked the atmosphere and service.  It feels more like you are eating at a restaurant in the city than in Flushing. The reality comes right back the moment you step out the door of the restaurant and you are on main street."
1543,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"Love this Japanese bbq place. We walked in w/o a reservation on 12:00 Tuesday and there was pretty empty. The meat was great and the service was good as well. It's actually quite similar to Korean bbq. If you like flavored meat, go there."
1544,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,Update to my original review. I introduced a buddy of mine to this Gyu-Kaku location recently and they have been hooked ever since. Not only is the food still very good but the employees and management have always been spectacular There is a new All You Can Eat Special deal Monday - Thursday at participating locations. For budget minded people there are two options : a Premium and Ultimate menu. The former is less expensive with a certain number of menu items while the latter contains more grill options as well as certain things like sukiyaki bibimbap and garlic fried rice for a bit more. Drinks are still charged separately but you do get a dessert option included (usually s'mores). And I may have not noticed before but there are also bbq sets that are good for two diners (or one very hungry person) which include starters like salad and edamame When you walk up the stairs there may be quite a few customers waiting (especially during dinner time). Reservations are recommended but walk-ins are certainly accepted based upon availability of seating. There have been more than one occasion where I had to wait for a bit but that was expected. The friendly faces at the podium you might encounter are always welcoming and they certainly remember you if you have dined more than once. Thanks to Deana and Karen for always being pleasant and friendly. Their position as primary contact for hungry and and sometimes impatient patrons can be overwhelming but they always manage to keep the waiting area calm. Depending on when you decide to dine in I have noticed that the severs are sometimes different.  Understandable as people do have different availabilities and schedule. My original server Waan I think I have seen once since I have been back. She was still working as hard as ever and had a different hairstyle. Chris takes very good care of his customers. He was one of my original servers as well. He remembers peoples faces and still takes time to say hello even if he is not assigned to your table. As server is he very professional and thorough. Victor is very friendly and polite to every table he is assigned to. He was training at one point but now is seasoned to be as efficient as his colleagues. Janice made a good impression on our table. She checked up on us very frequently to make sure everything was all right even though happened to be somewhat busy that evening. And she took time to say hello to us even when we were seated in a different section on a different occasion. Eric is very personable. Even when not on duty or getting off shift he still takes time to greet customers in the common area. As a server he certainly is able to build rapport with customers and works very diligently to make sure orders arrive in a timely manner. Special mentions go to Dennis and Ian who greet regular customers.  Howard took care of me most recently and takes responsibilities very seriously. The management team consistently show how much they care about the customers. Koyo is always courteous and friendly as he deals with a lot of customers. Charles and Dennis make several rounds to check tables for grill changes and to see how customers are doing. Kay certainly looks out for customers to make sure they are having a good experience. They take time to introduce themselves and what I respect about them is that they work alongside the staff whether dressed in stylish business attire or not. I am not sure if this is a common things at other locations. The teamwork at this location is very admirable.
1545,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"As of the writing of this review I had been to the Flushing location twice. Both times I had a great experience.  As you walk through the front doors and up the stairs there is someone to greet customers at the podium.  A very polite hostess named Jas asked me if I wanted a table with or without a grill (because there is a bar as well). I definitely needed a grill. I followed her up another set of stairs to a bustling area filled with patrons and the smell of grilled meats.  The seating area is spacious with tables that seat moderate to large parties.  As I was being shown to my seat she announced my arrival and the employees shouted welcome in Japanese. I had experienced this type of energy only at one other Japanese establishment. Jas was kind enough to find a booth seat that was convenient.  The tabletop grill reminded me of Korean BBQ except that there is no vent that comes down from that ceiling. My server was a nice girl named Waan who not only had a stylish hair cut but was very polite, courteous and helpful. In the beginning patrons are warned about the hot grill.  They have seasonal items like Ahijó shrimp but their main menu is where you find the appetizers and meat selections as well as dessert.  The seasonal shrimp was very savory. All food comes to the the table uncooked save for certain appetizers. The best sellers like Harami Skirt steak and other meats are all marinated in their signature gyu kaku marinade. Just like Korean barbecue you place your meat on the tabletop grill but you have to watch your food so it does not burn.  Certain meats are recommended to be turned at certain times depending on how you want it cooked. Waan, as well as the other servers and staff were very prompt in checking on me. They change the grills periodically as cooking multiple orders of meat tends to leave burnt residue. With each new grill change they take a brush to cover it with oil so the meat does not stick too much. When I asked about dessert she recommended the fried cheesecake which came with one scoop of ice cream. It was a very good dessert. The other employees on my first visit who were very helpful included Koyo (whom helped with explaining how the app works) and Sam (Samantha) who helped me when Waan was busy. As you leave they make an announcement and the employees shout Thank You in Japanese. I had not planned on returning so soon but I was in the area and the hours of operation were a tad bit later than on weekdays. As I entered and reached the podium there were three people there to greet me. One of the managers named Danny has asked if I had a reservation (which is optional I found out from the hostess Karen) and if I wanted to sit at the bar. I asked again if I could please have a tabletop grill. Karen led me to my table and I was welcomed but there was less energy amongst employees. It was quite understandable as it was busy. Once seated, Karen mentioned about that seasonal offerings and I asked for a recommendation. The DIY tacos sounded very good. It is important to cook the flank thoroughly (or whatever your personal preference is) and please note the spicy mayo they use has quite a kick to it.  But a very good appetizer. My server Chris recommended the Miso In Love seasonal combo that included the best selling Harami Skirt steak, bistro hangar and yaki-shabu thin sliced beef (all 3.5 oz). He pointed out that the deal for the combo would be less expensive than ordering each item a la carte.  After that was done and a couple of other orders (lamb chops are very savory) I could not leave without trying another dessert.  They have a classic s'mores where you actually roast a marshmallow and they have mochi ice cream (thai tea, chocolate chip, strawberry and green tea). For the second visit Sam (Samantha) had remembered me and came over to greet me personally and to welcome me back which surprised me as they probably get a lot of foot traffic daily.  Amy was very polite and courteous and helpful when I needed assistance. As she would walk by she would ask if everything was all right. Another manager who was well dressed named Kay seemed to be walking the floor and she made sure my drink was refilled and helped to change the grill. Chris took time to assist me in redeeming a deal from my first visit via the mobile application. The Flushing location is the newest and it is already seemingly popular even though they have been open less than a year.  The staff during my visits were very attentive with the employees working very diligently and utilizing team work.  They took time to answer questions, make recommendations. The meats are well marinated and taste very good after being grilled.The mobile app is a cool feature you do not see many other restaurants utilize. You accrue points by either scanning or entering the code on your receipt. This is a great spot for large parties as well as for those who happen to be very hungry."
1546,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,"One Word. HOT. The food. GREAT. The Service. EXCELLENT. My partner and I were craving Japanese BBQ and we were Anti-Manhattan so we made our way to Flushing. Little did we know that they had just recently opened, but to our surprise, it was running so smoothly that it felt as if it had been there for years. My recommendation is to make a reservation as we had to wait roughly 40 minutes. The place is not large, but they did a great job of making it feel roomie. We were greeted by our waiter who was excellent. He was super attentive and gave us the full experience. We reviewed the menu and rather than order the set, we ordered a la carte. For Appetizers, we were the spicy dumplings and the spicy tuna volcano. The dumplings were good and the sauce that covered it was great! The spicy tuna volcano was also pretty good though it seemed pretty standard. As for the BBQ, we got a ton of different meats and veggies and went to town. Meats marinated nicely and everything tasted so fresh. Many of the other waiters checked in on us which we loved along with the manager. It was a Friday night when we got there and we noticed that all the guys were really good looking. We hit the JACKPOT. We left so satisfied. Will definitely be back.Grade: A"
1547,wUu9WcGjP8KS6KlpARChyQ,I am not a big meat eater.  With that said I had a great experience.  The combo was well balanced with just right portion for two. Great quality meats to try.  Service was impeccable.
1548,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Delicious food. We ate:lBabaghanoush ( awesom, smooth roasted eggplant, tahini dip)Sigara Borek ( loved) Grandma's Grape Leaves (best ever)Grandma's Ravioli ( very different, small lamb filled pasta, I m not into lamb but my partner loved this dish.Extra Turkish Pide Bread ( nice to have extra, one big piece comes w each dip )"
1549,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Small, cozy Turkish restaurant with lots of wall decorations, mostly paintings. There are also outdoor seating. A small oil lamp adorns each table. The food is pretty good but a bit pricey. Their menu is a bit more varied than the typical Turkish restaurant, offering pasta and other traditional dishes besides the usual kebabs. The complimentary bread was delicious and fluffy. I had the hunkar begendi which is a meat dish in tomato sauce over pureed eggplant. I opted for the more traditional lamb, but it can also be cooked with chicken. The dish was delicious. The lamb was so tender and the pureed did not taste much like eggplant. It has the look and consistency of hummus. My friend had chicken saute in tomato sauce which was average."
1550,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Some dishes we loved, some we didn't.Ordered:Branzino- little dry or over cooked, plain.  I love branzino but wouldn't order it here again.  It was not horrible just not as good as I'm accustomed to.Lamb ravioli- way too rich.Some phyllo wrapped something- again way too richChicken sandwich-  good, very large, French fries good.Salad - cucumbers, tomatoes, red onion - OUTSTANDING, so fresh and delicious, everyone at our table loved this.Hummus - unbelievably perfect. Outstanding. Memorable, light and whipped and airy and tasty.Turkish rose wine - very good"
1551,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"This is a small restaurant and generally runs slowly, but it's food is delicious. I split a number of appetizers and main dishes with a friend, and we left completely stuffed!Favorites included the branzino, which you can get as a whole fish, the babaganoush, and the zucchini pancakes. I think the lentil soup was a bit smooth and didn't maintain the texture of the lentils (which I like). The cold white bean salad has a lot of great protein and gave me a good amount of leftovers. I would recommend going with someone who likes to share so you can lots of things!"
1552,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Love this neighborhood gem! Came with my family on a Saturday for lunch at 12pm. Restaurant wasn't packed so we were immediately seated. We ordered three entrees (lamb and chicken Adana, striped bass) and one salad. Total bill came around ~75 tax and tip included. AMBIANCE:Restaurant decor is very Turkish, with lots of dark cord and art, giving the place a very Turkish bazaar feel to it. I like it as it reminded me of the food markets back in Istanbul!PROS:Chicken and lamb Adana's were very delicious and cheap! The meats were seasoned incredibly well, and portion size was pretty big. The rice that is served is incredibly aromatic, and had a milky richness to it. Sour cabbage and onions paired very well with the rice and added a nice texture to the meal. Bread that they served came out piping hot and fresh. Complimentary bread served here was one of the better ones I've had in a restaurant.CONS:Salad was rather bland and wasn't too interesting IMO. Striped bass that came came with a lot of bones so it was rather tedious to eat. Beware of the micro bones in the fish! Could be a potential choking hazard. Fish was cooked very delicately and had a lot of flavor on the positive.OVERALL:Great neighborhood Turkish food at an affordable price. Their Adana's are definitely the star of the restaurant so highly recommend to check those out!"
1553,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"My boyfriend and I have walked by this place countless times saying we should try it and finally we stopped in for dinner one night. We had a wonderful time and a great meal! We didnt need a reservation on a Friday night and were seated right away. To start they bring out bread and oil for the table. I got the chicken shish kebab and my boyfriend got the lamb yogurt kebab. Both dishes were great. I preferred mine simply because it came with sides and rice and the chicken was grilled perfectly! The lamb in the sauce was great too but I felt like it needed a side of rice to soak up all the sauce. Overall a great meal, service was definitely a bit slow, food took a while to come out and it took our waiter quite some time to bring our check even after we asked for it. But the great food made up for it and we had a great evening!"
1554,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"WOW! For someone who has never tried Turkish food (except rice pudding), this was one of a hell of an experience! The complimentary bread was soft - just how my friend and I like it. Other restaurants give hard, unable to chew bread. This was already off to a good start.My friend and I both got lamb adanas, which were so juicy and tender. It literally melted in my mouth. We also got the octopus salad. The octopus salad was the highlight of our meal. It was incredibly good and we were so tempted to get another octopus salad. It looked like it was going to be simple on the menu, but it was insanely SO SO good. Hospitality-wise, the waitress and the waiter was really nice. They were always attentive and they kept pouring water into our glasses, which was a plus since nowadays restaurants don't seem to care about pouring more water when you're done (at least the ones I've been to). This has easily become my favorite Turkish restaurant and I hope to come again soon!"
1555,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"The food was not the best and I was not able to eat it. We told the waiter that I was allergic to tomatoes and he brought my food it was full of tomatoes, we informed him of the tomatoes and his reply was, ""what can I do, it comes with tomatoes, you can take medicine"" didn't offer to fix it or change it. It was a gyro platter. That's the first and last time I will go there."
1556,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Very impressed with Agora and the menu was massive. The lamb shish kebab in yogurt sauce with homemade croutons was absolutely fantastic, and they actually cooked it medium rare upon my request. Additionally, the complimentary dipping bread with an olive purée and olive oil was a great way to start the meal. The seating is a little close and the service is a little slow, but the waiting staff was very friendly, and I will definitely be back."
1557,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"What a jewel in middle of the upper east side of NYC! Wanting to stay local, and within walking distance of our place, for a dinner with the girls, my friends and I decided to try out Agora Turkish Restaurant. All three of us are fans of Turkish food (in fact one of us even lived in Turkey for several years) and because we eat it often enough that we are familiar with what to order, and how the dishes should taste. Every single item we ordered here, from the appetizers (Shepard's salad, hummus, babaghanoush) to our entrees (lamb adana and lamb shish) were delicious! Absolutely nothing to critique or complain about.Besides it's convenient location, the main reason why we chose this place for our girls night out was that we saw on Yelp that it was BYOB. So not only were all of the dishes we ordered prepared well and yummy, but it's also BYOB! How often do you find a BYOB establishment in NYC? What confused us a little however was that they also had their own drink menu - most places would not let you bring your own bottle if they serve their own alcohol, but this place was totally cool with it.If you're looking for authentic Turkish cooking with a Turkish vibe that also allows BYOB then you need to try this place!"
1558,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Best Turkish Restaurant ever in NYC. The food was great and the service was super nice and attentive.
1559,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I'm not sure how I've never reviewed this. Go here if you're on the UES and want good turkish food. It's a small spot so usually it's packed or has a wait. Does have outside seating in the summer. Mostly byob I think sunday through thursday. The babagonoush (spelling?). JUST GET IT. and the bread. wow. And it's also next to one of my go to sushi spots too. Love this part of 2nd ave.
1560,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"This review is for vegan and vegetarian people. Fresh and well seasoned flavorful food. Options for vegans and vegetarians such as hummas, spicy veggie dip, zucchini pancakes, red lentil soup.Red lentil soup: One of my faves, well sasoned, tasty and smooth.Spicy veggie dip (ezme): a bit more chunky than other ezme I have had and not too spicy. Very flavorful and went well on zucchini pancakesZucchini pancakes: Best I have had, cripsy and tasty."
1561,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Marinated chunks of chicken kabob is delicious. Add yogurt sauce and it's perfection. Bread that comes with dine in is toasty outside soft inside. Lots of art on the walls looks cool. Tables for 2 outside.
1562,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"A Turkish delight. It's no secret Turkish cuisine is among the best in the world. You will be hard pressed to find a restaurant in NY or just about anywhere else serving a finer array of tasty excellently prepared Turkish food. This warmly comfortable restaurant is friendly, quiet and surprisingly elegant. We truly enjoyed every bite."
1563,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Good food, good service and good location. Outdoor chairs are pretty but could use cushions.  Land Adana was delicious and the delectable small shepherds salad is enough for 3 people!"
1564,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Pros: Food was deliciousWe ordered the mixed appetizer platter and mixed grill kebab entree. The babaganush is amazing!!Cons: The service was so slow...we had originally ordered more food but had to cancel it bc it just took way too long to come out. The restaurant wasn't even that busy..
1565,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"This is a really good place to have a taste of Turkish food. I really like zucchini pancake, rice pudding, and chicken adana. Definitely come again in the future!"
1566,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Decor, ambiance, service, food-- all exceptional! We had the mixed grill to share (2 people) and it was plenty! We ended up taking the rest to-go. Flavors were rich. We were even served Turkish tea on the house !"
1567,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Great food. Good prices. Good ambiance. Staff is super nice. I didn't like the hummus as much but our salad was great.
1568,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,The lamb is delicious here - kebab and Adana are the best. Eggplant salad is also fantastic. The space and decor are really nice - when we come it's just an overall wonderful experience.
1569,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"3.5 starsI've found really difficult to fins a good kebab place here in ny given than there are plenty good back home in Barcelona... Although it did not come with the wrap (yoghurt, veggies) I was craving, the kebab plate was really tasty.Lamb amazingly cooked, flavourful and really melted in my mouth, rice... OMG what a rice! It was kind of sticky rice and not sure if it was coiked with broth or what but was so so yummy...Will come back!!!Portions are huge, be careful!"
1570,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Very nice turkish restaurant with great quality food. Had the lamp kebap which tasted great but was a little dry - not too bad. The side of fries were seasoned perfectly. Overall a very good dinner. See you again.
1571,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"WONDERFUL! Perfectly justified 5 stars with no reservation! Easily my fav restaurant in NYC. We decided to try this restaurant on the spot on a Saturday noon because we all got kinda tired of the same old flour-based brunch items. What a wise decision! Beautiful interior and decors (love the paintings!!). Impeccable service. Most importantly, IMPRESSIVELY DELICIOUS FOOD!! I beg you people to all get the Babaghanoush. It's an appetizer made with smokey-flavored eggplant and tahini, and it's so so so good. Grilled Octopus Salad has a solid portion of grilled octopus in it, and the dressing was light and tart in a perfect way. Grandma's Grape Leaves, flavorful. Gyro (Doner), less impressive, but still very good. And the butter rice underneath the gyro, oh my god, so good. Desserts continue the glorious road. Rice pudding is to die for. The sweetness and silky texture was so elegant--no oversweetening, no smell of a fridge, love it. Kanafeh is perfect to go with coffee. I was suffciently caffeinated that morning, so I had to miss trying the Turkish coffee, which I will definitely get next time (the little mug is just too cute!). Can't wait to take hubby there and explore more items!"
1572,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I ordered take out from here. I walked by and took a menu last week. The kabob chicken is dry and lacks flavor and arrived cold and had barely any rice. I ordered what was described on the menu as sautéed spinach with garlic and it arrived looking like spinach artichoke dip from a bar. The Shepard salad is small and is terrible. How do you mess up a Sheppard salad? I never had Sheppard salad that tasted like it does from this place. Not at all worth the $38 plus tip for take out and when I called to ask why the spinach looks like this they were rude and said I didn't read the menu properly and told me to walk over and return it. I just had surgery which is why I ordered take out I'm not walking over there. I've ordered spinach before at Turkish restaurants and it never looks like this. I choose this place over two others in the area because this one looked like a small business and I thought to give them support. Never again. Look at my attached photos. Lastly,  the person taking orders barely speaks English to understand what you want or your address for that matter. Anyone that gives this place many stars has not had Turkish kabobs often or frequented enough Turkish places to know how awful this place is. I didn't eat the food. I basically just could have opened my window and threw $40 out the window."
1573,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Not the type of food I was expecting but still good.  I'm giving it a 5 star because their customer service was excellent.  They didn't include a pita which was suppose to come with our hummus order.  Called them up and they had someone bring it over with some baklava to boot!
1574,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I have eaten turkish food all my life and i have to say i was excited to try this place on 5/16/19. This was the most disgusting calf liver i ever had. I asked the server if it was freshly made and he said the cook said yes. It was not and not only that, it was over cooked and was terrible and like rubber. Didnt even offer to take it back, just said sorry. Real service you guys got going on here. And maybe look into a cook who knows how to cook."
1575,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,You must visit this restaurant if you are in a neighborhood me and my friend love the ambience of the place it has so many beautiful paintings hanging on the walls it really transports you to turkey. Our server Buro and his lovely wife were just so hospitable so nice. We had some Turkish coffee and baklava and it was amazing.
1576,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Ordered mixed appetizers - it was mostly good but tasted vaguely sour and too heavy. Also had red lentil soup which was tasty. The white sauce and hot sauce that I ordered was store bought and they charged $1 for it. Wouldn't go back.
1577,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Perfect place for Turkish food in the neighborhood. Checked it out once and I've been returning ever since (took my relative there too when she visited). Will come by again. Nice service. Beautiful environment. Highly recommend.
1578,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Delicious, fresh and consistent. In addition to the wonderful food, the restaurant has beautiful decor, hospitable service and nice outdoor sidewalk seating."
1579,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Great prices, solid service and I loved the food. Keeping it simple for this review but I think this definitely fills the Turkish need in the upper east side."
1580,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"So so good!! Pleasantly surprised when we came in for dinner. Prices are reasonable and the food is fresh and flavorful. I ordered the chicken shish platter, chicken was not dry but I definitely recommend the garlic sauce on side. We missed the BYO memo; will definitely take advantage of that next time. The Turkish red blend we tried was good, not great."
1581,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I loved the chicken and lamb adani dishes here! The Turkish tea was good (not incredible) and I enjoyed the baklava. The rice pudding was super creamy and you get a lot for the price!
1582,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Eskandar kabob all the way. flavorful meat, red sauce and yogurt sauce with a side of rice . Loved the way they cooked the rice. It kept its aroma. We also got the Turkish ravioli and that was very good as well. Friendly staff. On a nice day you can sit outside and enjoy a 5 Star meal!"
1583,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Best: Baby Okra,Good: Babaghanoush, Baklava,Hummus (Not as flavorful as the babaghanoush, so best to have one or the other but not both).Good to try, but too sour for me: Ayran (yogurt drink).Overall, the food was pretty good, and they gave us decent bread with olive oil. Service was great. I would come back for their lunch special."
1584,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"More like 3.75 stars. I came here with a friend and had a good meal. The place is beautiful, with plenty of art work to look. The service is welcoming and attentive... really nice folks, here. Their complementary warm bread was a good start. - Baba ganoush: as previously indicated by other yelpers, it's delicious; a wonderful balance of delicate tastes, not too overpowering, surely one of the best I've ever had.- Zucchini pancakes: they needed more salt, but overall they were pretty good. - Calf's liver: not a dish for everybody, but I thoroughly enjoyed; a huge amount. - Lamb hunkar begendi over eggplant puré: this traditional dish was a tad disappointing. Maybe because my expectations were high, but although the eggplant puré was tasty, the meat wasn't tender. For $21 you'd expect better quality. - Baklava: just ok. Overall, I'd go back fir the appetizers, and to try a different entree. Recommended."
1585,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Excellent service and food!! Great atmosphere too!I can't pick one thing that was the best, everything we ordered was excellent!!!  The bread, the wine. The tea, the appetizers and the main course! Wow. Must come back here!!!"
1586,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"The lunch special (Tu-F 12-3pm) is a particularly good deal. You can get an appetizer and entree for $12.95 (two-course, or appetizer, salad, entree and dessert for $16.95."
1587,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Delish! The octopus especially. Great Mediterranean options for the UES.My only complaint is that they got rid of BYOB over the weekend, which unfortunately pushes me to other restaurants. Please consider bringing it back!"
1588,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"This restaurant is right around the corner from my apartment and is always packed.  So after walking by this place for years my boyfriend and I finally decided to give it a chance and I am sooooo glad we did!  We were seated fairly quickly for walking in without a reservation on a Friday night.  We started with some house wine and then ordered cacik, which was served with warm pita.  We then settled on the mixed grill platter to share, which came with a combination of chicken and lamb and was more than enough food for 2 hungry individuals.  The atmosphere was lively and the food was delicious.  I would recommend to anyone and everyone!"
1589,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"FABULOUS food and awesome decor.  friendly staff,  I ordered chicken kabobs, moist and full of flavor. Husband ordered shaved lamb,  so soft you could almost spread it.  large portions and great price. had the rice pudding for dessert... LOVED IT!"
1590,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Home run Family friendly Good food Fresh Authentic Makes me happy Your a keeper agora!! Maybe just bigger feta chunks for the salt lovers like me
1591,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"My fiancée and I came here recently for his birthday and it was nothing short of excellent. The hostesses greeted us right when we walked in and a server took our drink order immediately upon sitting down- it gives you the feeling of being welcomed, not rushed. We started with the hummus and mixed vegetable dip (I forgot the Turkish name for it)- both were phenomenal and made 10X better with the warm bread they serve it with! I had the chicken kebab platter which was very filling, it was just the right size. The chicken was generously portioned and tasted fresh. To top it off, the pricing for our meal (two appetizers and two entrees for $65) was quite reasonable given the sizes and quality of the dishes.All in all, we will be returning!"
1592,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Everything we ordered was delicious. The lamb over eggplant in the yogurt sauce was exceptional. If you go here that is my recommendation 100%. You will not be disappointed.
1593,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Food is good. The falafel was well fried but not doughy and had a good herby flavour, lentil soup was wonderful and creamy- vegetarian too! However, my gripes come with the portion. For a 17.00+tax lunch, how are you going to give me half a small cup of soup and half a kadayif? It literally looks like someone took a bite of it. Adding insult to injury, the bread that they provided me with, one piece amongst two lunch specials- was so stale it had to be tossed. These types of things unfortunately ruin a good meal and prevent future orders from occurring."
1594,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"My partner and I came here on a Friday night at around 8p. Thankfully, there was one table left and we didn't have to wait. The restaurant is small and you kind of have to sit on top of each other so be prepared to listen in on conversations to the folks sitting near you. But that didn't deter our great time. The restaurant is beautiful, intimate, and cozy. Our server was lovely, attentive, and just very warm just like the atmosphere at Agora. They started us of with delicious Turkish bread and a very fine tapenade in olive oil which was delicious. Since I was starving, we pretty much inhaled two baskets and still had room for an appetizer and two entrees. We opted for the baba ghanoush  which was excellent. Perfectly smokey, creamy, and chunky pieces of eggplant. My favorite!I had the lamb chunks done medium with rice, picked cabbage, and onions. Lamb was delicious. I asked for medium rare, but it was a little over cooked still very tasty nonetheless. That buttered Turkish rice side OMG. Honestly one of the best sides of rice I've ever had anywhere. My partner ordered the lamb adana and he also liked it very much. With all that food and a bottle of wine our bill was not shocking. They even gave us a nice sweet pomegranate tea to end our meals. Agora is special and I'd highly recommend it."
1595,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Very tasty and good people work there. Ask guys about suggestion. Good for casual evening!
1596,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"You know your fellow Yelpers helped a sister out when you find your dinner spot to be the most packed restaurant on the street. We thought we'd be the first ones there because it was early for dinner, but the restaurant was already full! We managed to snag the last open seats -  a sweet table inside, but right next to the open doors - perfect. The restaurant was simply charming! Great ambiance for date night... candles on every table, dark inside with natural light pouring in, and it was loud enough so you can have a leisurely conversation without having to worry about keeping the volume low or in my case... laughing too obnoxiously. Service was top-notch. Food was good. Bread didn't taste AS good as it looked in pictures, but still good nonetheless. However, I do have to take a second to rave about our favorite part of the meal - Chef's Borek (vegetarian). The fiance had to pull me out of my comfort zone to get this rather than one of our usuals, but I am SO glad he did. Simply scrumptious! I ordered the zucchini pancakes as my entree (under hot apps), which were good, but wish they were less soggy and more crispy! But for the meat lovers, the S.O. had the lamb adana kebab and gave it 5-stars!"
1597,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Ambiance: 4/5Food: 3/5Service: 3/5Cleanliness:2/5When you spend most of the meal swatting mosquitoes and flies out of your food, you are less inclined to enjoy your meal. When the waiters pay no attention to you and the food is just mediocre at best, you don't go back. Fun to have lines from the Quran interspersed with scenes from turkey on all the walls though. Please try to make this an enjoyable place to eat?"
1598,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"My significant other and I go to this restaurant all the time and we love it. It has a nice, homey atmosphere. Th walls are adorned corner to corner with antique art and paintings. The colors are warm and you can eat your dinner by the glow of a working oil lamp (extra cool). The dishes are incredible. Our go-to is the Hunkar Begendi with chicken and the hummus or baba ghanoush. The side of sautéed vegetables is underrated and delicious. They really make the meal. Definitely one of the best restaurants in the Yorkville area."
1599,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Best Turkish food!!!! Lentil soup is my favorite and definitely most delicious lentil soup I ever hadGreat place very clean and cute great service and delicious food of course!!!! Highly recommend this restaurant
1600,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Good here is delicious and the service is very attentive. We decided to sit outside on a week night and that was a nice change from having to sit indoors. The service was pretty good, as we kept asking for olive oil because they were not giving us enough for our bread. Both chicken dishes were very tender and flavorful. Overall it was a great dinner and would reccomend this place to anyone in the area."
1601,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"The food was delicious and authentically Turkish. I'm a huge Turkish food lover and I know when I taste a good chicken shish kebab. I ordered the spicy vegetable and chicken shish kebab and they both were very delicious! The Turkish bread was great too. Above all, the service was great. It is not a very spacious restaurant and mostly packed but despite that, the service is phenomenal. We were seated right away and provided menus and water. We were served with Turkish bread and the olive oil (I think that's what it is) immediately after. The servers were really hospitable and made sure to ask if we were happy with our meals. Highly recommended!"
1602,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I believe the decor is better than the food. The interior is beautiful. It's spacious for Manhattan standards and its definitely a place you could take someone for a nice outing. They also have a series of larger tables so that you can go in groups.We were really impressed with the service and speed at which the food came out. We ordered Calf's Liver and Grandma's Grape Leaves for appetizers and got them within 10 minutes of ordering. When my wife and I both were considering the same dish, the server recommended something different to us in order for us to get more variation and I really appreciated that.Regarding the food, I was a tad bit let down. As mentioned, the service was better than the food, and that's not to say the food wasn't good; it just didn't pack quite the punch I was expecting. I got the Hunkar Begendi (with Lamb) and while the Lamb was well cooked, and the eggplant was also generally good, I felt that for the price I expected slightly more portion and flavor. I did see that their portions for Kebabs are quite generous and perhaps next time thats what I'll try."
1603,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Oh my gosh there were four of us for dinner and this is the most incredible restaurant in New York City. It is very small and quaint but the Turkish food is outstanding. We had the meze platter which had a little bit of everything and it was to die for. Then we had the is Iskenderun and Adana kebab with little pieces of lamb and yogurt and tomato sauce which was absolutely delicious. The desserts are amazing and everyone there is so attentive and kind. Definitely the best restaurant in the city.
1604,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Best spot for lunch by all means! Great lunch specials. I think it's the best Turkish family owned restaurant in the whole city! Absolutely love it!
1605,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Visited Agora on Sunday night and it was almost full. Nice interior but the food was the main attraction. Food is very good. Grape leaves are one of the best I tried, both hummus and babaganoush also very good. Lamb shish is done just right. Very attentive and fast service"
1606,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"If you're in the upper east, go to Agora! We got the octopus salad, begendi, grandma's ravioli and kazandibi for dessert and everything exceeded expectations. They also bring complimentary delicious warm bread and olive oil for dip. The waiter from Ankara was super attentive and very friendly. Highly recommend this place!"
1607,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"From service to food: 5 stars all around! They have a BYOB policy Monday-Thursday.The staff was great and so attentive. They make sure your water never went empty and gave great suggestions from appetizer to dessert. The food. Amazing. We tried the Turkish coffee, the octopus salad, the chicken aldona, baklava, and the milk custard dessert. Everything turned out good. We were so tempted to order another octopus salad."
1608,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Great dine-in and delivery, both were outstanding. We get the Mix grill, babaganush and octopus salad. Ask for extra bread and make sure to get the olive paste with it!"
1609,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Safe to say I plan on coming back here again to try more of the dishes at this adorable little Turkish place on the Upper East Side. After walking by it quite often and seeing a large crowd, I decided to give it a try! Service right from the start was incredibly friendly and quick and remained excellent throughout the visit. Hands down best baba ganoush I've ever had. Would 100% order this again although I definitely want to try other appetizers. The baba ganoush was excellently seasoned but the bread that came with it was amazingly crisp and I could hardly stop myself from getting another basket. The lamb Adana kebab was so much better than I excepted it to be, and I had high expectations after the appetizer. The lamb was so juicy and tender, the rice buttery and delicious, and the other sides complemented the rest of the dish really well."
1610,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Great time at Agora Restaurant last night! We started off with two glasses of wine. I forgot which one I got but it paled it comparison with my fiancé's agora red wine. Really smooth wine and would definitely recommend it. We had them split the appetizer to half hummus and half bahaganoush. The hummus was very creamy and went well with the delicious bread they give you. I'm not normally a huge babaganoush fan, but still enjoyed this one. For dinner my fiancé got the octopus salad and I got the lamb adana. She was a bit disappointed with the octopus salad given all the great reviews and thought it didn't have much octopus in it. Maybe it was just an off night since the other pics on here seem to have a ton of octopus in it. The lamb Adana was amazing! Delicious meat and outstanding spices. The sides that come with it were also tasty. Would highly recommend it The only negative thing was how small our table was and how close it was to the neighboring tables. I know it's New York so tight seating can be expected but we felt right on top of the people next to us and the waiters had to have us move our table so they could get by. Overall great place and will definitely be back to try other things."
1611,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,used to be so good! now the meat is all dried up and vegetables are dry and look old. Very disappointed and will never come again. There are many other options in the area so this place needs to improve
1612,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"High energy Turkish restaurant with fantastic service and very good food.  Ambiance.  The ambiance was cozy, energetic and lively, tables filled with groups, families and couples having conversation.  Seemed a place where people felt at home, many customers who'd according to the server been coming here years. Service.  All the tables were full but we were seated relatively quickly, and servers mostly seemed Turkish with a busy and confident energy and attentiveness .  Wine and food.  The huge wine glasses make wine a must, though I personally was not a huge fan of their reds.  Food was very good.  We had:- tomato/ cucumber salad with feta on the side. This was fresh, delicious, wonderful- baba ganoush and a huge serving of bread- also good and the bread was great - grilled calamari - not my favorite, but likely also because I'm used to getting grilled octopus - mixed grill- very good mix of chicken and steak, well presented with a colorful selection of cabbage and vegetables Recommend as an energetic Turkish restaurant to go with friends, family or a date."
1613,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,My favorite Turkish restaurant in the city! Everything is absolutely delicious and it's byob during the week.  Highly recommend!!!!
1614,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Tried this place for takeout and was blown away by how tasty it was, despite it not even being served in the restaurant. The flavors were rich and multi-layered. Grandma's Ravioli was a unique dish to us and a must-try. We thoroughly enjoyed it. The Kibbeh ranks above most of the other kibbehs I've tried. Even the Grape Leaves were better than the standard and I'd believe it if they said they make it in house. A great spot for representation of authentic Turkish food!"
1615,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Superb meal! I ordered the chargrilled swordfish, which came with grilled bell peppers and sweet red onions over traditional rice, a very large piece of bread, and a side salad. As an appetizer, I selected the eggplant salad. Swordfish entree ($18.95): Grilled to perfection and so, so flavorful. Swordfish tends to be a meatier fish, but here it was still moist. The rice was also wonderfully seasoned and absolutely delicious. It's hard to call it an accompaniment when it stands out, even against the smoky flavor of the fish and the sweet vegetables. This entree was a winner. Portions were ample. Eggplant salad ($7.95): I liked this tangy smoked appetizer mashed with roasted peppers and mixed with dill and garlic. However, I was less enthusiastic about its oiliness.  Still very good pungent flavor. Overall the food is terrific. Great value given the scrumptious flavors and undoubtedly filling portions for the reasonable prices."
1616,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Really authentic decor, the food was ok nothing to rave about, and the service was decent. Wish they had their air conditioning on since it was scorching hot that day!"
1617,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Cute little storefront Turkish restaurant.  The staff were lovely. We were served very good Turkish bread with olive oil.  Tried some Efes malt beer- it was good. We split an order of excellent smoky, garlicky babaghanoush.  My wife had the chicken kebab platter, my brother the doner platter and I had the Agora salad with grilled chicken. Everything was excellent.  The a/c didn't quiet keep up with the hot weather. Otherwise, a great restaurant. Isn't agora a Greek word?"
1618,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"It was really good, the rice was delicious and the lamb I'd say a 9,5/10 i won't give 10 as I believe they could put a little more rice"
1619,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,When I receive the bill and kept all cash i have as tip (which is not big amount) then they gave me back the invoice with the change and put circle around the tips condition they have. minimum 18% of the total invoice. this action is as inappropriate.
1620,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Went here about a while ago and I remember that this is a cute spot with pretty solid Turkish food. It's a small restaurant with many table cramped inside but it gives it a homey feel. The service here is excellent too and everyone who works here is very nice. It's BYOB but unfortunately only on Thursday evenings - though something to keep in mind since there aren't many BYOB spots in the Upper East Side!
1621,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I ordered lamb gyro plate and agora salad with grilled chicken just about 2 hours ago. Everything on my gyro plate was cold and dry, including rice. It was more like a leftover food from someone else's plate. They did the delivery on time, so they get 2 stars for that. Salad was just ok."
1622,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I'm a bit disheartened to write this review! A little disappointing to be honest with you.Overall, as a whole, I found the food to be just okay. And a bit greasy. The complimentary bread is really great but the rest of the meal with very disappointing. I had the grape leaves along with the kibbeh. The grape leaves were okay but I really wasn't a fan of the kibbeh. The flavors weren't quite right. My fiance had the iskander kebab, which we both found to be a bit greasy unfortunately. Overall the prices are a bit high for the quality of food. I will say the service was good and the food did come out quickly so for a quick meal, it's not the worst spot."
1623,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"One of my favorite on the upper east side. Great, cozy atmosphere, excellent food, very good service."
1624,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"3.5 rounded up to 4 because of the service.We were in the UES and in a sudden mood for Turkish. Our go-to place is a few blocks south, but we thought to give Agora a try thanks to its great Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed.We came in on the trailing edge of the dinner rush so the tables were just reopening. The staff greeted us immediately and took amazing care of us. We wanted some nice, dry Turkish wine and the staff was very accommodating in letting us try different ones until we found the perfect match.The food was also very good. We enjoyed the fragrant octopus salad (yum) as well as the fried calf liver. They came out super hot and crisp. The zucchini pancakes weren't too spectacular. For entrees, we split the lamb shish kebab and the yogurt adana. Both were good. We ended with the sweet Kadayif."
1625,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"came for lunch with a friend and it wasn't very busy so there wasn't a wait to sit. we shared the chicken adana and the hunkar begendi with lamb. the chicken was very flavorful, though personally i was a bigger fan of the hunkar begendi. the eggplant puree was incredible! umami and subtle. probably the best dish I've had eating out in a while. the lamb went great with the eggplant. they came out with a tray to show us the desert options rather than with a menu, which i thought was a nice touch as you could see exactly what you were ordering. had the kazandibi milk pudding, which my friend liked and i was ok with. 4 stars because we did wait a while for our food, but the service was quite nice."
1626,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I like this restaurant The food was really goodThe service was great  I must say the olive oil that they've used is top quality and you won't test something like it even in the 5 star restaurant. I think if your around the area and want to taste a good food you must try this restaurant.
1627,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"A cute Turkish restaurant located on the upper east side with a variety of options to choose from.We had ordered the zucchini pancake, lamb hunkar begendi, and the chicken sauté with tomato sauce. All dishes were very tasty and flavorful. My favorite was definitely the pancake as well as the hunkar begendi (lamb with eggplant purée and tomato sauce). The purée was soft and melted in my mouth! I recommend this dish!Overall, great service and great food!"
1628,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Delicious red lentil soup and bread. Nice quaint atmosphere. Glad I stumbled upon this restaurant. I'll be back.
1629,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"We made reservations which was a good move. The small restaurant doesn't really have a waiting area, and it did have a wait. We waited about ten minutes and a departing customer wholeheartedly recommended the sea bass. Once inside, it was very warm and comfy. Our waiter was very attentive, knowledgeable and funny. The hummus and Babaghanoush were excellent, as was the pide bread. I ordered the sea bass, but my excited anticipation was unfounded. It found it very bland and dull. I did try all the other dishes that we ordered. They were all deliciously noteworthy. The Hunkar Begendi was my favorite. If only I hadn't listened to that tourist from Georgia. So even though my entree was a bit boring, everything else was so delish that I won't hold it against the rating. We finished with the Kazandibi, which is a caramelized burnt milk pudding that I say is a must-try.  Agora was a very nice evening."
1630,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Horrible takeout from Agora tonight. The chicken was dry, tasteless and tough and the food had little flavor. I have eaten here many times, but lately the takeout has been awful and it's too expensive for this type of service. Disappointing."
1631,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"We love Agora. We eat in and take out. The food is consistent and delicious -- from the lamb to the hummus you can't go wrong. The restaurant is cozy, airy and decor feels authentic. This is a must try."
1632,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,This restaurant presents a real taste of Turkish food. The Iskander Kebob was even better than those I had in two Turkish cities.
1633,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Got the grandma meatballs appetizer very flavorful.Also, got the Gyro plate delicious!  the restaurants overall is very cozy and gets packed at night. Definitely will go back!"
1634,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,So delicious! My husband and I went around 6pm Saturday.m night without making a reservation. The restaurant was busy but not fully packed yet. It did get packed and a small lined formed around the time we left (7:30ish). We started with the babaghanoush which was perfect with the warm toasted bread they gave us. For entrees we got the lamb over eggplant and chicken shish. The eggplant turned out to be babaghanoush again but no biggie since it was delicious. Both really good. Their rice is especially flavorful. For desert we got the rice pudding. Nothing crazy. We've had better but they gave us free hot apple tea to go with it which was very nice of the restaurant. Service was great overall since we did read reviews that service was awful here but we didn't experience anything negative.
1635,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Good delivery. Fixed everything. Food was warm. Bread is delicious. Nice place
1636,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Ordered delivery from Agora based on a recommendation from a friend.  Judging by the positive reviews on Yelp and my friend's recommendation, I expected much better--particularly given the price of the food.  Unfortunately, the portions were small and haphazardly thrown together in the small tins (one of the sauces spilled all over the bag), and the delivery took 1.5 hours.  The food was average.  Had it been half the price and arrived in half the time, this would have been a 3.5 star review.  Check out Beyoglu or A la Turka for much better quality or Yia Yia's for equal quality but better value."
1637,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,The Iskander is really good and grape leaves are very flavorful. The baklava is delicious. Saw a lot people order chicken Adana. Will try that and some lamb kebabs next time. Overall really good food! Price is reasonable too. Glad to have this place in my neighborhood! Will be back!Must mention the amazing bread and olive oil! Good food served in a homey atmosphere by really pleasant staff.
1638,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Food is always great and service is very attentive.  Love the zucchini pancakes. So happy that you can book a reservation through Yelp.
1639,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Neighborhood gem!!! Family owned, family run small and slightly eclectic resturant. Homemade delicious food that never disappoints. Everything on the menu tastes so fresh and is made well. You can tell they take pride in how they cook. It's a small resturant that's perfect for a casual date night or family dinner. BYOB M-Thursday is a huge bonus!"
1640,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Happy to find a authentic Turkish place near home.  The food was great, we ordered almost every the type of kebab, nice meat and tasty! Definitely will go back again soon."
1641,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Awesome place, great ambiance and amazing food. Would love to go back to this place.Highly recommend it"
1642,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Great turkish restaurant in NYC. Great service food was awesome specially manti.  I was going to order dessert which is kunefe but I was so full. We will go there again tomorrow. I will order kunefe for sure.
1643,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I Like this place .It's différent !We need more  places like that !The food is good.
1644,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Valentines day massacre!! I used to love this place. It was my.go to for middle eastern food. Not anymore. This review is 1 year late. We ordered chicken sishkabobs and they went down pretty well but that's where it ended. Instead of the romantic evening of dining and dancing that my husband and I planned, i spent the big night on the toilet bowl! And not in a good way. It's too bad..this place really sh#t the bed."
1645,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,A wonderful lunch today for a large group. The food was delicious and the staff friendly and accommodating. Will definitely return for authentic Turkish cuisine.
1646,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I've been here twice (only because I don't leave any where close), but just thought to post a review, since this is probably my favorite Turkish/Middle Eastern Restaurant in the city, and the review feels like a high five. Can't remember what I had the first time, as it was over a year ago. But the second time, I've had their Chicken Adana Kebab, and Stuffed grape leaves, and although these are nothing unique - this restaurant served the best kind; and I've been to many :)In short, the food is delicious, not overpriced. Apart from that, the decor is super cute, and the people serving (I believe are the owners, since this is a family run business) are extremely nice. Planning to take my mom here this summer :)"
1647,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,This place is really amazing. Been a long time since I had Turkish food and this little spot more then satisfied my cravings. The meat was so tender it just melted in my mouth. Staff was very friendly and delivered everything we needed.
1648,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Before I even begin. The food here is delicious and so flavorful! I'm not a frequent visitor of UES but Agora will certainly have me back.  Came here with friends on Tuesday. I made reservations for 6:30 however I think I would've been safe with none till about 7:30, afterwards it was packed. We all had the lamb adana which was delicious and paired it which a red Turkish wine per the waiters suggestion. We were stuffed but managed to still order the baklava to share. We all commented how it was the perfect level of sweetness! Will make my way there again"
1649,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"After a full day at Central Park, my BF and I decided to check out this restaurant; turned out to be more of a 15-20 minute walk.  We arrived at 6:30 to find the restaurant empty, but people started coming in around 7.  I ordered the white bean salad, but thought it was meh.  Mostly beans, not enough vegetables.  But the lamb sauté was so amazing.  Perfectly seasoned, tender, and the best I have ever had.  The 5% discount from checking in on Yelp is also great.  Definitely worth the walk!"
1650,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Decent food. I got this delivered (might have been the difference between 3 and 4 stars)and hadThe yogurt lamb meatballs (a little under salted but tasty)The plain yogurtFriesAll well done - will go here at some point and hopefully update this review
1651,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"I've had this new found love for Turkish food and this little spot we found after a day at the museum was the perfect way to end our day of outs and abouts and culture. The place was packed but we were able to get a table right away. From beginning to end my mouth was melting with deliciousness. The decor and ambiance of the restaurant is so lovely. There is so much to look at and take it. Our server was very fast pace and helpful. Our glasses of water never went empty. Our bread basket (omg the bread) never went empty. The sampler we had that consisted of 4 or 5 different ""dips"" (may not be the right word) was heavenly. My main course the chicken Adana was out of this world. The best I've ever had. My fiancé and cousin ended the night with Turkish coffee and the coffee cups they were served in were the prettiest ever. This place was definitely a great place for dinner with friends and family! We loved it here"
1652,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Ordered delivery from this restaurant based on its great ratings on Yelp.  I ordered the zucchini pancakes based on people's review.  However, that was the least favorite dish out of the entire order.   The pancakes arrived all soggy, I could not taste anything other than the overpowering amount of oil.  I had better zucchini pancakes before.  The hummus was ok, I still like the hummus from Sahara's Turkish cuisines the best.  The bread that came with the order was good. The entrees that we ordered, Chicken Adana and baby okra with tomato sauce were just ok.  They do give you a generous amount of baby okra which is great, but the dish didn't taste anything special.   My friend ordered the Chicken Adana, and he didn't like it.  It's good to give a place a try, but I think I will not order from here again.  I order/have Turkish food on a frequent basis (at least 3 times a week), so I have a certain expectation with the taste and quality of Turkish food.  I think there are better options in Manhattan with the price you pay."
1653,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Really liked this place. Of course the quality of the food is the biggest factor, and it was just great. Kebabs, rice and salad were all delicious! Service was very good too, and the place has a nice decor. Highly recommend if you're in the area."
1654,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Delicious dishes - fairly big portions. Loved the lamb! Baklava for dessert was good too
1655,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,The bread was great.  Zucchini pancake was too oily.  I will give one more star if they dial down the salt in every dish.
1656,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"What an amazing little spot to pop into! Having never gone to a Turkish restaurant before, I was rather excited to try this!  The result, on every level this restaurant delivers - which I have to admit is fairly rare to come across.Their customer service comes across as friendly and genuinely concerned about your experience with them. So feel free to ask them if you have curiosities about the menu. I ordered and took great joy in eating the flavourful and tender Lamb Adana. It's a ground char-grilled lamb seasoned with red peppers served with rice, cabbage and onion salad, a jalapeño and grilled tomato. The ground lamb sits on this interesting bread. Oh, speaking of bread, they serve a great homemade bread as you wait for your meal. I had to stop eating it to make room for lunch.I also gave their baked rice pudding a try. Delicious way to end a meal. It's served in these super cute terracotta containers.I gave them five stars for the way they dealt with an issue the table in front of me had with something with their meal. The server was calm, professional and pleasant. He took what they said and quickly apologized. He made sure to remove the item off their bill and also brought the entire table Turkish tea. Although it was not my table, I was impressed.  So, my friends, there you have it!  Highly recommend!"
1657,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Amazing place, delicious food. It feels like you are at a Turkish home.Appetizer ordered: Babaghanoush, silky eggplant purée.Entrees: Sautéed lamb and Lamb Shish. However the the Lamb Shish has casted the Lamb Sautée into the shade. So the Lamb Shish is strongly recommended.Service was an A plus, I have to mention our handsome waiter's name, Ozon, talk to him you will be alright!"
1658,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"We had the best time here. The staff is family owned, very friendly and accommodating and the FOOD. The bread was warm and crusty and the dipping sauce was flavorful and really tasty. We started with hummus, a yoghurt cucumber dish and a fried cheese in dough (I don't remember the names- sorry!) and they were all very good. Then we each got something a little different - chicken, lamb, cream sauces, and more and they were amazing. I got the gyro meal and it came with a buttery rice, a cabbage salad (my favorite) and a red onion salad. The lamb itself was the best I've ever had, tender and the ends were crunchy like it should be. For desert we got baklava and another dish I can't remember, Turkish coffee, and Turkish delights. They were all really yummy! We will definitely be back and highly recommend. Also the apple tea is a must try!"
1659,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Food and service was delicious. We had the lamb shish and zucchini pancakes. The zucchini pancakes were a little greasy but they were still good. We also had the baklava for dessert and that was the yummy but super sweet.
1660,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"So, let me start off by saying that the food was AMAZING -we all really loved it.  But we had a weird experience in terms of the service.  And considering we found this restaurant through Yelp - we thought we'd pass on the info about our experience.We were a group of 9 - for lunch.  When we were seated we were asked if we wanted sparkling or tap.  There was some confusion and the server opened the sparkling water.  When we realized there was a charge for the sparkling (limited budgets here, folks!) we all decided we wanted the tap.  This is when things went sour.  Our server became visibly angry with us and began debating.  Then she no longer wanted to work with us.  All because of a bottle of San Pelegrino?!There were a few other instances, miscommunications, mis-understandings... but the long and the short of it is... none of it was handled with grace by the employees.  We were made to feel as if we were the Worst Customers Ever - and that is not ever how you want a customer to feel."
1661,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I lived in UES for two years and this spot was right up the street. Not sure how I would've survived without it as my go to seamless order. Their food is delicious and reminded me of my time living in Istanbul and now that I've moved from NYC it reminds me of the city- their kebabs are great and love the Turkish rice with Simit (bread) definitely worth stopping by if in the UES neighborhood not too far from the Q 86th street stop :)
1662,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Pleasant wait staff and tasty food.  Came in for a bite to eat before going to the AMC down the street and the staff was quite welcoming despite us coming right before kitchen closing.  Glad to stop by and would easily come again.
1663,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,Loved it! The ravioli are to die for and their rice is absolutely amaizing!!!! We had great service and food was outstanding! Rice pudding for dessert just the perfect way to finish our meal. Hande was our server and she did a fantastic job! We would definitely come back!
1664,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"We've walked by this restaurant a lot, and always say ""we have to try it"".  So, today, we did.The food was excellent, the service was excellent and the atmosphere was excellent.  The prices were typical ""upper east side"".It's the perfect spot for a date (romantic atmosphere)! We will be back..........."
1665,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Great food, service and worth the buck. We got a table for 2 immediately on a weekend. I went looking at the reviews and it certainly stays true. Food: Got the zucchini pancakes that was crisp on the outside and perfectly cooked and soft inside. Definitely try them. The Adana kababs, both chicken and fish, were great - Freshly cooked, tender and well marinated. Love the garlic yogurt. They serve black olives dust and oil with bread for everyone, try with the black olives. Service and Decor: The server gave us good recommendations and the service was great. It is a tiny restaurant so the tables are a bit cramped and that's common in NYC. Tip - BYOB from Mon to Thu."
1666,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,I love Turkish food and this place did not disappoint. I could tell from the incredible high quality of the free olive oil and bread that the meal would be special. I'd recommend the baba gannouj to start and any of the yogurt marinated kebabs.
1667,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"They nailed down the trifecta, great food, great service and very reasonable prices (especially with the fact that they're BYOB).Food is good - authentic, I think, well seasoned and not overcooked.  Octopus salad - for $14 it's a steal.  The octopus is tender and came out slightly charred.  And it comes with a healthy serving of greens.Chicken Adana Kabab - our favorite.  Think chicken meatball but super moist and super flavorful. Comes with rice, cabbage and onion salad and grilled tomato.  The whole combo is just $14!! So good.  We ordered another one.Manti - think ravioli, Turkish style.  Comes with yogurt sauce.  I'd say it's interesting but it wouldn't be my first pick.  It's good for variety though.Lamb over babaganoush - the lamb is very tender and not too gamey.  The babaganoush is great for dipping the bread which by the way is also really good - fluffy and warm (we got three refills for the basket).Service is very friendly, efficient and not pushy.  It's certainly a neighborhood gem and I can't wait to come back.  Please stay this way."
1668,7gZGVdqMch7ls0IGO3DijQ,"Ordered via UberEats, and found the meal to be surprisingly perfect.Got the octopus salad and branzino fillet, and everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned and absolutely delicious.Will definitely be ordering again....may even trek over there myself someday."
1669,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Literally the best fish tacos everrrr! im so sad that i live in manhattan and this place is so far from me but when i visit my cousin around the area, theres no question, This is what we're eating!. Along with the perfectly made frozen lemonade.. please open a location in washington heights. thanks!"
1670,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Went on a Sunday around 1pm. Place was completely empty. The food took a long time but it was really good. The platter of different taco sauces was a nice touch.
1671,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Fish tacos were great ! Also food delivery came earlier than expected. I will be ordering again.
1672,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Best Mexican in the Bronx! Very open to customizing meals to fit my vegan/plant based lifestyle.
1673,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Though the food was good, it wasn't particularly spectacular. I'm giving this review for the top-notch service provided to me and my friend by Bernandino. He is an excellent server. He took the time to explain the House drinks to us and even allowed us to sample them before making a selection. He was very attentive and in good spirits. He made our dining experience there enjoyable.Thank you, Bernandino!"
1674,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I love this place. Their tacos are soooo good !  I like the horchata too. Not too sweet. Their table red salsa is super delicious too. Courteous employees & my food is always ready on time. I've tried their tacos, chalupas, taco salads, guacamole, chips & salsa, torta.  Almost all the basic stuff.  Two thumbs up for this place."
1675,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"We have ordered in once. Tonight we decided to dine in. This is a small, clean and bright establishment. Our waitress was very cordial. We ordered shrimp hard tacos, with just cheese, and guacamole.  And we ordered shrimp soft tacos, and a steak soft taco. It came with rice and black beans! Everything was flavorful!  They served us with excellent chips and salsa! Very good. They put out some condiments as well. Too spicy for me. It was a pleasurable experience. The food is prepared from scratch, and so fresh."
1676,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This WAS my go to takeout place.  I ordered from here at least twice a week for months.  Always the exact same order.  Chicken fajitas with chips and salsa instead of rice and beans.  The first issue I had with them was I placed my order on seamless as always and an hour later still wasn't here, I called and was told he would be here in a min.  45 minutes later he arrived.  1 hour 45 minutes for delivery is ridiculous!  The next time I ordered it arrived missing the salsa for the chips and a diff salsa for the fajitas.  If I had my own in the house it wouldn't have been a big deal but I didn't.  I called them and the guy who answered was rude and spoke horrible English.  I told him what was missing and asked that he please redeliver.  He told me it doesn't come with any salsa and he can redeliver but would charge me an additional $6.95 for the salsa (which is in a small jello-shot size cup). I'm far from cheap but I'm not stupid.  I said first of all I ALWAYS order from you and always the same items...don't lie to me and say it doesn't come with it!  Your menu even says it comes with salsa.  Second now that my food is cold and he was arguing with me over a side of salsa I said come get your food and I want a refund if you won't make the order right.  He said if I wanted a refund to call seamless or he can charge me $6.95 and deliver he then HUNG up on me.  At this point I was ready to walk in and throw the food at him! I contacted seamless and told them about the horrible customer service I received and they refunded my money right away.  I wouldn't go back to this place if it was the last place around I'd rather starve! I also told everyone I know to avoid it as well.  Btw stop putting your menus in the lobby of my building I throw them all out immediately anyway! Plenty of other restaurants in the area that can throw grilled chicken, peppers and onions together ‍"
1677,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Really good authentic food. My wife and I come here about once a month and have never had anything bad. Great food that is inexpensive. I love it here but be warned- it's not very big. They have about 9 tables(don't hold me to that number) but we have never had a problem getting one.
1678,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"That spicy chorizo taco I just had..... wow! All it was missing was some guac! It was my first time trying Mama Puebla, and it won't be my last!"
1679,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I've gotten delivery from here twice, and both times, it was between a ""meh"" and an ""ok"" - I'd say about 2.5 stars. I didn't have an issue with the delivery, but the food was not memorably good and average overall. I won't say that I'd never order from here again if I'm craving some Mexican and don't feel like leaving the house, but it's not going to blow your socks off in any way. It's fine, but it's not the best I've ever had."
1680,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Please don't order from this place. We ordered two taco salads and one of them had a fried roach attached to the bottom of the taco shell. When we called the restaurant requesting a refund, they asked for photos which we provided, but then they send a delivery guy to pick up the roach. Waiting to see if they honor the refund... Worst customer service ever, we plan on calling 311 in the morning. Customer service here is disgusting, please send your money elsewhere. I"
1681,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Picked up an order of tacos poblanos with carnita and I couldn't stop eating. Really delicious flavor and so filling.  I'm not sure of the name of the red based spicy sauce on the side but it completed each bite.
1682,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"The service is good, not too pushy or over solicitous. The food is even better. It's so delicious and flavorful. We are definitely coming back!"
1683,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"We have ordered most of the main courses on the menu and have yet to be disappointed. We have eaten inside the restaurant, but the majority of our orders have been delivered which we have not encountered any problems; in fact, they always arrive a lot quicker than the estimated time. MY favorites are their Quesadillas, Burritos, Tacos, and  Fajitas. Love their salsa, chips, empanadas, or salads as an appetizer. on a couple of occasions there seemed too much cilantro in their guacamole, but otherwise, I would highly recommend this restaurant for some authentic Mexican/Spanish cuisine. Anet A."
1684,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,This place is legitimately the best Mexican spot in the Bronx and the cleanest. Never have I had a bad meal here and the deliveries are always 10 min earlier than estimated time. The best!!
1685,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This restaurant is definitely a must try...stopped by randomly for a quick dinner & was pleasantly surprised by the deliciousness. Ordered the tostada de tinga & a gordita, the rest of the orders were fish tacos, a chicken torta & an order of chalupas...everyone enjoyed their meals!!!"
1686,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I cannot explain how refrained I have been from reviewing this place. I do like their food.  However, tonight was the straw! Every single time I have ordered delivery their has been something forgotten . When I call they want to either argue with me or are ""sooo busy""! Tonight I recieved the burrito. Photos show. I picked it up and grease poured out. The whole thing was covered and gross. I have gotten food frozen and they ALWAYS FORGET THE DAMN DRINKS!! The guac and pico are great. But really come the F on guys. You just lost a customer for sure!So I proceeded to go back to the restaurant after he told me it was wine. I went back with my plate to show him it wasnt Wine as well as the photos and had already returned the burrito via delivery re pickup.. Lol. GD this is funny. And he told me that they cook in oil.. But I thought it was winE?!?  Holly shit! He proceeds to tell me that I am a problem and that I should never call back. He gave me the 16 in cash and I went home. YES THE BURRITO COST 16 DOLLARS! When I came home the delivery guy also came back with the 16 so I took it for th rest of the food we recieved. My BF ate all of it in 20 min he was so hungry from the 1.25 hour wait from a place 4 blocks away! Needless to say do NOT order. Their lack of customer service and inability To fucking cook AND KNOWNTHE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WINE AND GREASE IS CRAZY AS WELL! And they do not take responsibility for the fact they always mess up shows how bad they are.  I went in and their was one dang table.  SOOOO BUSY. Uhgg can I give negative stars?"
1687,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"We been ordering and coming to this spot for a while now.  We absolutely love it!!!The best guacamole and chips ever. The only negative comment, is that there is a guy behind the register, not the owner, the younger guy with no glasses, he has NO customer service, he is rude and not a people person.I am afraid that if they don't get rid of him people will not come and dine in...."
1688,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Had the Bistec Fajita (Steak sauteed with onions, peppers and tomatoes, with soft flour tortilla, rice and beans) and their house Guacamole.  I had this twice and both times it's been very good.  I've never been inside the restaurant, ordered twice from Grubhub and their delivery has been on time so far."
1689,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Ordered a chicken quesadilla for delivery through UberEATS. Order came and there's no chicken, so essentially I paid $17 for bread."
1690,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Horrible..... If you want to wait for  hours for your food to arrive, order form this place. Not only did the food take 2 hours to finally get to me but when it did it was disgusting, and I ordered an Iced Tea Snapple they sent Kiwi... Called the place multiple time and it constantly took me more than 2 calls in order to get them on the phone and after telling me the delivery guy was minutes away I had to try and call back because that was bullshit also only this time they didn't pick up the phone avoid this place like a plague seriously people and the person who picks up the phone was rude...I'll write this review in Spanish as well.Horrible...... Si quieren esperar años para que la comida les llegue ordenen de este siete.. No solamente la comida duro una eternidad para llegar sino que también supo horrible, estaba bañada en aceite. Espere DOS horas para que la comida llegara y cada ves que llamaba tenia que marcar el teléfono mas de dos veces porque no lo contestaban, cuando al fin si contestaron y me aseguraron que el delivery boy estaba al doblar la esquina que fue mentira también intente llamar una tercera ves solo que esta ves nunca respondieron el teléfono. NO ORDENEN DE ESTE RESTAURANTE SE LOS ABIERTO SE BAN A ARREPENTIR y el tipo que contesta el teléfono es un grosero!!"
1691,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"You know you love a place when you keep coming back for your fix! I was hoping this was gonna be that Mexican place for me,  but it wasn't. I had so much trouble placing my order cause the guy didn't speak English well and couldn't explain the specials, but I ordered the asada steak. Which for Mexican food was tasteless and the dish seemed like it was haphazardly put together, some steak pieces, some veggies and voila! I'm sorry but I didn't like the food at all, maybe it was a communication problem but still shouldn't steak just be delicious no matter what?"
1692,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,I order here on a regular and one thing I notice was the leap in prices. So I eat in one day an hear the guy saying to the other guy round off the taxes high? Lol so now every time I order out I notice the prices are high and the guys just say 75.50!!!!! and when we go over the prices he's the highest Mexican place in town lol quesadillas are 10.75! And he says the menu has changed but when is it coming out? He sends the same one with old prices. I'm done I won't ever eat here again he can round off his child support on his mother vato!
1693,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This place is really good and I order on a regular. Have sat in and tried the food and it's amazing. The tamales, the chips, slasa and the guacamole It's all good."
1694,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Great food! The best Tostada Salad I've ever had in my life (and I've had a lot). The freshest ingredients including the salad, cucumbers, salsa, mole and carrots! Unbelievable grilled chicken. This is what I eat for my gains after a workout. I don't feel guilty at all that it's surrounded by the fried shell, that's how fresh and huge it is."
1695,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"First time in NY and after looking for a mexican place, we found this one...but after my wife and myself get into this place to get some food with my service dog...the casher guy just said my dog was not allowed and after I explained him that my dog is a service dog ...he still said he wasn't allowed and after my wife got mad and told him that he can call to the 800 number on my service's dog I.D. to check him He allowed us to stay but in the bad way and we decided to leave the place."
1696,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This place does have authentic Mexican food. I have eaten at the location and order out from this place often both by phone and online. The location is relatively small but the staff is attentive no complaints. As for delivery give it 30mins to 40 mins but friday and weekends of course it may take longer. Out of the numerous times I have ordered my hot drink came spilled once and they did forget a drink another time. I called and they resend it. I love their Nachos, chimichangas, chilaquiles, tortas, and tacos. The champurrado (mexican hot chocolate), aqua de horchata, flan and tres leche cake are really good too!"
1697,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Absolutely delicious. Flavors are soooo good! Complimentary chips, salsa has a nice kick. Enchiladas and chicken tortilla soup are excellent. Has dessert and lots of sodas, jarritos. Highly recommend. Note that delivery can take awhile, it's a smaller place. Worth the wait and great to come in person too."
1698,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Great place to eat, service was excellent, food was on point. My family and I will definitely be back..... Only reason they didn't receive 5 stars was because they didn't serve alcohol, I was really looking forward to a margarita"
1699,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Ordered delivery two weeks ago, the delivery was quick and my food was still warm which was great except I ordered a chicken burrito with VERY LITTLE chicken, it was full of delicious veggies but hardly any chicken. Truly disappointing, given the price and high expectations due to great reviews on here. I felt compelled to review them after having a true burrito delivered from another local restaurant, which is now my new go to place."
1700,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I have been coming to this place for over 2 years now. I must say I love it.  Good place to eat. Their choice of food is awesome. They have a variety of different things to try on their menu. Mama Puebla's food is definitely tasty.  I love the chicken enchiladas, they are spicy, but not overwhelming. They have just the perfect amount of chicken,  cheese and cream.  Perfect level of spiciness and taste.  I have also tried the tacos, and quesadillas,  both def winners.  This spot is tiny,  but so worth it. I like that the food is always hot and fresh."
1701,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This place has terrible customer service. I called for delivery twice and I never got my order. The first time they took my order then later cancelled because they don't have a driver. The second time I waited an hour and a half for my food and when I called to follow up, they told me they decided to cancel my order because their busy to complete the delivery. They should have called me to tell me they canceled my order instead of making me wait. Never going here or ordering delivering from here again!!!"
1702,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Mama Puebla is a tiny hidden gem (cliche alert!) in the Throgs Neck/Schuylerville area. A friend of mine sings its praises, so since I was in the area last night and they are open late, I figured I'd give it a try.For starters, the restaurant is small but cozy. I wouldn't bring a big group here. But my boyfriend and I were immediately welcomed and offered a table. The menu is pretty vast with almost all bases covered. The chips and salsa were notably tasty! I realized that the chips, as well as the main dishes, were not overloaded with salt. As someone who hates salty food and the feeling of bloat you get afterward, this is a major A+ in my book.I ordered the vegetarian fajitas which came with warm flour tortillas. Rather than just a pile of onions and peppers, this dish came with squash and tomatoes in the mix. The veggies were sauteed but not drowning in oil! The portion was also big enough for leftovers.The dessert choices are pretty wide, too. The fried ice cream was adorable, and the waitress even lit it on fire for us! It was a fun experience for a casual Thursday night.Anyways, call me crazy but with the exception of the fried ice cream, I would argue that Mama Puebla's food is actually quite healthy. Not a lot of salt and not a lot of grease! Since I am trying to make better choices, I will definitely be returning."
1703,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Best authentic Mexican I've had in the tri state area.  Order take out from here on a regular basis and they never disappoint
1704,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Amazing dishes served fresh. This is my second time here and I can truly say that the hike from Riverdale to eat here is so worth it!!
1705,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Love the steak taco salad and the guacamole is the best!  I will never visit Throgs neck Chipotle again.  I will make the trip to East Tremont just for the Guac! Great place, good music! Truly an authentic feel everytime i walk in even if just for takeout!"
1706,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I have come here twice usually for takeout. The food is always made fresh and extremely tasty , I have no complaints. Portion sizes are great too. If you are in the mood for a Mexican food on the go  definitely stop by here."
1707,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,The food is good but I wish that they spoke some English it would be easier to order the menu also was hard to read but I love the food.
1708,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Giving it a 3 out of 5 Stars.. The food is Delicious and the Delivery Time is Quick. Just don't ask for extra anything or for any special accomindations.. If you have any specific requests (ie: trimmings on the side for your autistic child) the kitchen will NOT fulfill it. If you ask for any extra anything the lady who prepares bag for delivery will NOT follow through with your request; even if you ask multiple times. You'd think they would want to keep a regular customer, that wasn't asking for much, happy.  #TakeOutNightIsRuined #LostACustomer"
1709,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Nice cute little Mexican restaurant. Mexican is not my favorite choice of food when I go out to eat but this is my Mexican spot. Fish tacos are absolutely amazing. The place is clean but small, and staff are really friendly. Definitely recommend to check this place out!"
1710,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Food is very good. Fresh :) we tried tacos de Carne Molida, Chicken/Pollo & steak they were good. Chicken Quesadilla are great comes with a side of guacamole:) they not far from the highways."
1711,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"The food is good however, their customer service sucks. I ordered to go and it took forever. When I questioned what was up, the guy gave me an attitude and said the food is made fresh so I can't expect it to be fast. That alone turned me off so I HAD TO REMIND HIM that down the street, where they also make the food fresh and it's just as good, I am in and out in 10 mins. And they don't give me attitude. Bloop!"
1712,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Gave them another chance.  Always use seamless to order.  1hour 10 mins after placing my order, I've decided to give them a call and cancel it since it has taken so long.  After the restaurants assure me that the food just left and will arrive soon, I'm stead fast and ask to cancel it.  He hangs up on me.  I call seamless and they took care of my refund and even called the restaurant.  Low and behold, another 20 mins later the delivery guy calls informing me that my food is outside. I instruct the delivery guy to return to the restaurant with the food because I had canceled it.  I understand that my business probably won't be missed by this restaurant.  Hopefully my reviews will sway away potential customers though."
1713,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Hits and misses.  Always ordered via online for delivery. Did the nachos a couple of times until they optioned to use sautéed peppers instead of jalapeños. Totally ruined that plate.  My other go to was the pico de gallo.  Price goes up a dollar already making it more expensive.  Then no jalepenos!! The main ingredient listed on their menu for this dish! I even called and made them aware.  No recourse or action.  Glad to know that the person answering the phone is capable of speaking Spanish, English, French, Portuguese etc.  yes, mockingly he decided to inform me of his several languages ? Weird. 3 stars because food is actually good when they do actually get it right."
1714,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,One of the best damn chips and guac and chicken soup I've ever had.... EVER! Will definitely order here again. Highly recommend.
1715,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"ABsolutely terrible service. I made an order to be delivered to my home. It came almost 20 minutes late. When it came there was an extra item in the order that I did not ask for nor did I order it. They said I had to take the order as is. I sent the order back. Maybe Kiki should start hiring people with some brains. It doesn't take much to do a good job and have some common sense in dealing with customers. I never have a problem at Castle Hill same owner. Also the delivery moron left my back gate open. I have two dogs, if they had gotten out he would have had a serious problem!"
1716,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,What can I say. Possibly the best mexican food around. Very authentic mexican food at very reasonable prices. The food is fresh and prepared beautifully. We eat here at least once a week and everything can be made to order. The guacamole alone is a reason why you should try this place. A++++
1717,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,There food was disgusting; when I called to complain about it the guy caught an attitude and hung up on me.
1718,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Ordered from seamless - quick delivery.  Awesome chicken burrito! Makes my top three. Tasty guacamole too.
1719,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Excellent food. Very fast delivery. Delivery guy is so nice and very friendly and extremely grateful when you tip him. I highly recommend this restaurant if you're craving Mexican. PS- Their guacamole is amazing.
1720,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I've had there burritos,  tacos, and torta sandwiches and everything has been really good. And staff is friendly based on order for pick up. I have never sat and ate in."
1721,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Love Mama Pueblas. We order from there pretty regularly (avg once a week). The steak tacos and nachos are a household favorite. During the busy times...deliver can suck but most of the time, it's quick and food is hot upon arrival."
1722,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This place is the bomb dot com. Eat here all the time. Slightly Americanized Mexican food, but still soooooooooo good. Try the steak tacos with their green hot sauce. Or the tortilla soup with shredded chicken. Yum. The horchata is just the right flavor. And the guac is on point. I'm about to get me some right now just talkin about it."
1723,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,I'm gonna keep it real and describe this place in 2 words- fucking awesome!!!!Food is GREAT !!
1724,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Every time I have ordered from here they don't listen to what I write.... this is the third time I have said ""no onions, no tomatoes, no peppers"" every time they have put onions and tomatoes on everything, like they don't even read it. They also refuse to give you a refund for it all!"
1725,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Ok so the food itself is fresh and good but it's a bit pricey for what it is (why is a burrito $9?!) and also my main gripe is that service is horrible. My friend and I went in and were seated immediately but the waitress totally ignored us and instead chose to be much more attentive to the two other tables she was waiting on (coincidence that they were both tables of Spanish speaking Mexicans?) I speak fluent Spanish (Castilian) but I elected not to, so apparently I was given snail treatment because of it.. Also after I ate I asked her for a box to take home my leftovers at which point she took my plate away and I never saw the other half of that overpriced burrito again. You're much better off at Lupita's across the street service is better and faster (the food is on par just doesn't have quite as nice ambiance, but whatever)."
1726,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"good food and reasonable prices. it's a very authentic restaurant, down to the music. the guacamole was great and so was the salsa and chips"
1727,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I love this place!!!! Best authentic Mexican restaurant that I've been to so far! I always buy 4 steak tacos and an order of chips and salsa. I use some of that salsa over the tacos too . I wish I would had taken a picture of my food yesterday. I'm ordering again today! I only wish they would deliver to Co-op city, if they did I would put all of my co-workers on. It's even good as a sit in restaurant, it's small and cute! I love the painting they have on the wall too."
1728,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,If u come to this spit u got to try the chicken fajitas OMG it's to die for. It's a authentic Mexican spot with fresh veggies and meats.  They have the best guacamole o ever had.  The condiments came with peppers and three different type of hot sauce which is great I love variety.  The desert was great for tres leche  go try this place out bet u would give 5 star like I did.
1729,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I love the food and service here. Too bad they don't deliver to my area, but every chance I get to eat out or pick up.. I do :)"
1730,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Beef like rubber!  Over priced is ok if you get something for it! You don't  here! If you take cheep  ingredients make it look good charge a lot it's still cheep ingredients !  Cheep food for  $50 bucks no thanks! Don't go!
1731,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,I'm obsessed with their taco salads but the tacos are great as well. I always get delivery. I have never been inside so I can't really say anything about that. I also made an assumption about a language barrier and always order online. I think my favorite thing is that they are open late. I get home from work late and I can't always eat at Crosstown. Delivery is almost always very fast. Can't say anything bad about the place! They have not once messed up a single order which is impressive because I tweak the things on the menu.
1732,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This hole  in the wall is amazing!!! Great service, AMAZING food! The food is so flavorful and cheap for how great the food tastes! Highly recommend this place!! I will keep going back whenever I am craving Mexican Food!!! Have been there twice and it will not be my LAST !!!!!"
1733,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,I'm only giving one star because it won't let me write a review with no stars. HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! We just moved back in the area and wanted to try something new. Wrong choice! The owner/worker whoever he was is RUDE! We placed an order for delivery and after 1.5 hours I decided to leave the house to find out what was going on because they WEREN'T answering the phone. I get there to ask about our order and the pregnant girl looks at me like I have 2 freaking heads then tells me to wait for the guy. As I wait for him my boyfriend calls me to tell me the food arrived but that my food was cold. As I requested a new order the guy is telling me I have to bring back the food that is supposedly cold because according to them they send out the food right away. We placed our order at 7:46 pm the food arrived at our house at 9:29 pm. So you can imagine how hot (NOT) my food was. This guy gave me such a hard time that I WILL NEVER ORDER FROM THIS PLACE EVER AGAIN!!! I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE ORDER FROM THIS PLACE!
1734,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This place was by far the worst!! I ordered by phone waited for my food for about an hour. When the food arrives the beef was burned, tacos taste horrible. My husband didn't finish his steak it was gross. Waste of money for sure. Never again"
1735,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Yummy !! Delicious Mexican food. Very affordable, clean restaurant. Great service. The young waitress was friendly and professional.."
1736,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Great food, quickest delivery ever. We usually order from Estrellita, but I'm so glad I took a chance and ordered from here. The enchiladas Suizas are to die for. I hope they are around for a long time. If I could give this restaurant 10 stars I would!!!!"
1737,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,We come here twice a month sometimes more. If you want a burrito or hard or soft taco it is very good. All of the items on the menu are worth trying. If you want good quality food that will make you feel like your in Mexico this is a place for you.
1738,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,They never get the order right because they cant understand they dont bring receipts and they take forever and there was hair in my food never again
1739,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,The BEST guacamole ever....a must try if you're in the neighborhood.
1740,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This spot is straight doo doo! Sold me a $12 soup that was water and hot sauce, then refused to allow me to return it."
1741,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"Friendly staff. I love getting guacamole and chips from here. They make it fresh and give a nice size serving. I got quesadillas from Mama Puebla not too long ago. Most places give you dips (I.e. Sour cream, salsa) and that's it. Here, you also get to choose a side (plantains or salad) AND you get a small side of guacamole. Yum! Can you tell I have an obsession with guacamole? Great value.  Looking forward to trying their soups soon."
1742,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,Just had takeout today--fabulous. Delicious chunky guacamole and awesome pork pastor burritos. The flan was amazing. We will definitely come back!
1743,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This little restaurant is awesome!, Their food is great, I dined here with a friend and ordered  my favorite dish which was so filling and tasty authentic mexican food!"
1744,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"This small restaurant success is because the food is tasty, fresh and consistent. I had it also delivered with no problems. Staff were friendly."
1745,pSJGPVjAyKb7EXGZkqLzvg,"I live in the area and this place left their menu in my mailbox one day and I saved it for some reason. Today I decided to order and I'm so happy I did!! The service a excellent and the delivery was so fast! The best part was the good of course! Chilles rellenos and steak enchiladas with verde sauce were excellent! Who would have thought this little place produced such high quality Mexican! No more Chinese and Pizza for us, this place is a keeper for sure!!!!"
1746,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Just like in the Taiwanese night markets... that custard is so good. I got the Oreo one, but a friend got sesame and loved it. So it seems whatever they have will be good."
1747,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"My boyfriend and I have been craving this for a while ever since we smelled it walking by. Normally we're too full to try so this time we made it a mission to go there to finally try. We ordered the taro and cream cake and the red bean and cream cake. Honestly my favorite part of both cakes was the cream. It was so sweet and was the perfect complement to both cakes. The taro was delicious, sweet on the inside and crispy on the outside. Unfortunately the red bean seemed to fall short tbh. The red bean was not a paste but rather just the actual red beans and they were not sweetened at all so you have to actually like the flavor of red bean to enjoy this one. I'm definitely open to try some of the other options like Oreo since I have a bit of a sweet tooth."
1748,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"This tiny place, located down a hallway, serves delicious authentic wheelcakes! The menu is simple. 2 for $5. Cash only. Depending on the day or the server, you may or may not get freshly made cakes. I'm sure you can request it. They come plumped and hot. My favorite was the taro/cream and red bean/cream. The fillings weren't too sweet and the consistency was nice. The black sesame can be gritty and the salty radish was good if you want get a little adventurous. Personally I found the oreo boring. It tasted similar to a fried oreo."
1749,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I had my first wheelie in Taiwan and fell in love with this street snack so I was very excited to see that they had it in Flushing! My friend and I ordered all kinds of flavors - red bean, red bean with cream, cream, and sesame. My favorite one was the red bean with cream because it really balanced out the bland-ness of the red bean. The sesame was packed with sesame flavor, but the sesame paste was rather sandy, which did not leave a good texture in my mouth. I'm curious to try other flavors because I was quite disappointed with the red bean, which is usually my go-to."
1750,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I personally like it sweeter so I gave it one less star but if you like a less sweet but filling dessert, this is your spot. I recommend the red bean and custard ones but again, it could be a little sweeter to my taste"
1751,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Note: Cash only!Go to the back of this indoor mix food court/business stores.  You will find a stand on the right-hand side.  It is run by two friendly woman named Karen and Wendy.  They make Taiwanese wheel cake, which my Taiwanese friend, said really reminds her of the Taiwanese ones.  That is a good endorsement already.There was an article in the newspaper so I decided to go try it.  By the way, the mall opened at 11AM.  The restaurant name literally translated happy red bean so I had to try the red bean wheel cake.  Omg...it was so good.  I thought that there would be too much batter and not enough filling.  There was filling in every bite.  Btw, it taste better when it is hot right off the grill.  It's still good when it cool down but it's missing the melt in your mouth feeling when it's hot.It was so good that I went back a second time to buy some for my friend to try.  Funny thing was I found out she tried various flavors.  She recommended that I try sesame and cream.I definitely have to try the other flavors!  If you like Taiwanese wheel cake, come here and try theirs."
1752,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Happy Wheelie is located all the way in the back of an indoor mall. It's 2 for $5 and they have 8 options that you can choose from. They make their cakes fresh and it's so mesmerizing to watch! I came with a friend and we opted for the sesame and cream and red bean. I liked how the filling wasn't overly sweet compared to other desserts. I enjoyed the sesame and cream one over the red bean but wished that they solely had a sesame option without the cream. It was definitely worth a try but I'm not too sure I'll be back.They had some samples of the dried radish wheel cake and I wasn't the biggest fan of that one. However, if you prefer something more savory over sweet that might be a good option.Heads up that it's cash only and there is no seating so you'll have to take your wheel cakes to go!"
1753,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"This place can't compare to Catmint Wheel Cake Cafe in Manhattan which is the epitome of the wheel cakes in nyc......but they aren't bad, a few tweaks here and there could improve the recipes further.Originally stopped in for joes steamed rice roll and my husband pointed out their newly opened stall in the back. Ordered a black sesame/custard and Taro/custard wheel cake, immediate impressions were:- black sesame filling consistency needs to be smoother, currently it's very gritty and makes the cake taste very dry. Perhaps ground the seeds to a fine powder. - the cake batter needs a little more sugar and to be more porous and spongy- the custard needs some vanilla bean and a bit more sugar, the consistency needs to be thinner too.What I absolutely adored was the Taro purée, fantastic I tell you. I would happily pay the $5 just for a tub of that! :D As mentioned in another review, it's not a good system making cakes in advance and having them sit to the side until sold. When people are paying for these, they expect them made-to-order even if there is a bit of a wait. The cake casing hardens, becoming a bit stale the longer it's left exposed to the air.Price point is reasonable though, and I would return again. Worth checking out if you're in flushing and haven't experienced these Taiwanese street food delights."
1754,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"It is located inside the small mall called Landmark Quest Mall. They had other food vendors inside as well. Since the mall is rather small, it was not difficult to find this spot. They had a few cakes that were already made and set aside, so that you don't have to wait for them to make them after you put in your order. They had the ones we ordered, so the entire ordering and purchasing process took less than five minutes! They had total of eight different kinds, and they were $5 per two cakes. We wanted to try all flavors, except ""dried radish"" one... I was not brave enough to try that one. The cakes were not too big, but a perfect snack size! The dough was light and not overly sweet. Cream filling was not too sweet either, which brought out the natural flavors of ingredients instead of masking it with sugar. Very nice! Oreo was super fun! It had two Oreos stacked on top of each other, I never had one like this before.We enjoyed them all, what a nice little snack, and very affordable too. Speaking of which, they are CASH ONLY so make sure to bring some cash with you before you visit."
1755,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Located within Landmark Mall on Roosevelt (across from New World Mall), it's easy to miss. But once you find it, you won't be disappointed. They make the desserts in front of you and it takes about 10 minutes from start to finish. They make it fresh, so it's definitely worth the wait. There are several different fillings, and it's super fluffy. I got 3 for $10, (oreo, red bean/cream and taro/cream). The oreo was really good and so was the taro and cream. I didn't get to try the red bean/cream so I'm not sure how that tastes.It wasn't overly sweet, and the batter was fluffy and light. Like the previous reviews, it is cash only, so make sure to bring enough with you."
1756,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Taste a popular dessert from Taiwan!  Watch them make it fresh.  This is the only place around that makes these.  It's a small stall inside a food/variety mall, that sells these cart wheel cakes.Taipei: Car Wheel Cake.  This is a variation of a Japanese dessert called Imagawayaki, that can be dated back the 1700's during the Edo period.  Around 10 years ago, this became an extremely popular dessert in Taiwan.  Some as street vendors, with it's sweet pastry aroma, filling the streets and beckoning you over. Wheel cakes have a soft waffle consistency type of dessert, filled with your choice of filling.  The most popular flavor being red bean.  This is made in a cupcake like, metal pan.  Two halves are made separately, filling is added, then the one half of the waffle/cake is covered onto the other.  I ordered the cream version and the oreo version.  If you've never had one, they are kinda cool to try and fun watching them make it in front of you.  But living in NYC, with such a huge variety of delicious desserts to try, it fails to really impress me.  Maybe other flavors are better.  People who have grew up with this dessert in Taiwan will probably love it, as it bring back fond memories.  It was interesting to try a pastry that originated back in Japan in the 1700's.  Flavors are faintly sweet.  Available flavors: red bean, cream, taro, oreo, dried radish, red bean and cream, sesame and cream, taro and cream.  Final note:  Two cakes for $5.  They recommend eating it hot."
1757,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I just want to say that I LOVEEE taiyakis which is similar to this kind of dessert but a Japanese dessert in the shape of fishies rather than wheelies. I love the fact that this place has a few selection of fillings. I loved the cream, sesame and red bean because they're not too sweet. The pricing they have are 2 for $5, 4 for $10, or 8 for $20. Only down side is that this place is CASH ONLY so make sure you bring cash when you come."
1758,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Found this place in the newly expanded Landmark Mall.  I have no idea how they suddenly opened up so many stores in here, but it's a really strange space.  I came in here for Joe's Steam Rolls and was taken aback by all that has opened.I saw this place making the wheel pies and had to try them.  They were making them fresh and they had some interesting flavors.  I used to buy these outside the supermarkets in SoCal.  It's cool that they're making a comeback and they're actually sort of well-regarded now.  Of course, the price has increased from the $0.50 they used to be when I was a kid.In any case, I went with a black sesame one and a red bean custard one.  I was disappointed when they handed me two that were on the side of the grill.  I guess they make them fresh all day long, but as they're new and aren't selling very much yet, the ones they make fresh then get put on the side to wait for someone to buy them.  Oh well.They were not as good as what I used to get as a kid.  The wheel pie itself was sort of soggy, without any hint of that crisp golden brown exterior I was hoping for.  The black sesame one had a weird texture to it and tasted sort of bitter.  They should work on the black sesame filling.  It needs some sugar to help bring out the black sesame flavor people expect when they order it.  The red bean one was okay, but there wasn't much custard.Overall, the ones I got could use some work.  The fillings need to be tweaked and made more sweet (and that's coming from someone who dislikes sweet things and thinks most things are too sweet).  They need more custard in each one.  And they need to do a better job cooking them so they're crisp on the outside and hold together better."
1759,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Definitely not my favorite. I took advantage of the 2 for $5 deal and ordered a red bean and taro. They have other flavors like custard and chocolate as well. I first took a bite of the taro and thought, wow is this even taro.. it was so bland and didn't have any flavor. Could've just taken potato mush, dyed it purple and called it taro honestly :/ I then tried the red bean. This was also bland but at least had small chunks of red bean in it; a little better but not by much. Outer wheel cake was slightly soggy and not as crunchy as i would've wanted."
1760,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,I am not the person like sweet. But this one is one of my favorite.   I didn't know that I can find this in flushing queens. I almost try all of the favorite.  I am sure I will back for the rest of favorite. Love the sesame favorite
1761,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,I am not the person like sweet. But this one is one of my favorite.   I didn't know that I can find this in flushing queens. I almost try all of the favorite.  I am sure I will back for the rest of favorite. Love the sesame favorite
1762,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I ordered 3 flavors to tried out today. This wheelie cake is in round shaped like a wheels & fillings inside. This is a traditional Taiwanese street eats. dried radish flavor are sautés radish chewy & very flavorful. Black Sesame tasted very rich, the owner is very generous on the portion. Taro is fresh made, I can tasted the fresh taro bites in my mouth. The cakes are very moist & soft. I will definitely come back again."
1763,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Really delicious. I had the ones just made, so the shell is crispy and the filling is hot. I feel it tastes even better than the ones I had at Taiwan from street vendors.I ordered two flavors, the taro and the sesame, both are very good. Both are not too sweet and have the real flavors that won't make you feel tasting like those chemical-ish ingredients found in moon cakes or cheap pastries. Only problem is - based on what I observed about their business in the 10 minutes I was there, I am not sure they can make enough big profits to grow their business. On the material and labor cost, they can't compete the profit margin with those milk tea business. I hope they do well and not disappear, or we won't find such wonderful ""wheelie"" cake in New York anymore.真的很好吃！因為是剛出爐的，脆的皮及熱乎乎的內容，吃起來更香，比我在台灣街上吃到的更好。可惜的是我覺得老闆可能不能賺大錢，費工夫，又不能像賣奶茶一樣一杯一杯不停的有人買。希望他們生意好，繼續賣，不然在紐約就吃不到這麼好吃的車輪餅了！"
1764,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"hmmmm tastes just liek Taiwan, IM SO GLAD they didn't adapt to the American taste buds and made everything super sweet. They are asian-level-sweet, meaning not super sweet.My go to is the sesame cream filling and the red bean and cream. Taro didn't quite work for me but i did taste fresh taro chunks!My only complaint to them was their business hours, only 11 to 7! The owner is super friendly too :)"
1765,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I'm a huge fan of wheelie cakes so when this opened up I was very excited!! However, it might be because I have had other really awesome tasting cakes but this one is just so-so. It might be because their batter or heat overall is too low so it's cooked slow which ends up not giving it a nice crisp but more just soft and .. soft. I like my cakes to have a tiny bit of texture on the outside. The cake itself could use a little bit more flavor in my opinion too. They do have a good amount of flavor options from Oreo, to red bean, taro, custard, sesame, dried radish, and combos of those with custard. Each cake is $2.50 (they advertise as though there's a discount but there isn't hahaha 2- $5; 4-$10; 8-$20) .  You do have to wait a bit for your cakes to cook. Overall, it's ok since it's the only whee cake in the area."
1766,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Very delicious!It could be more crispy outside, but the filling inside is not too sweet! I got the red bean/creme and taro/creme. Their creme is also different here reminds me of the Taiwanese style creme that they sell in Taiwan very flavorful but at the same time not to milky or too sweet. They sell the flavors in 2. 2 for $54 for $108 for $20Give it a try, a taste of Taiwan!Happy grand opening! Go give it a try you won't regret it."
1767,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Made fresh, delicious and favors to appease both the traditional, western, and adventurous palette.Went there about a month ago and finally got around to write this review but I'm def still craving for some more"
1768,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I came here and ordered 4 for $10. I had the Oreo, red bean & cream, sesame, and the taro. My favorite was the sesame and Oreo. It wasn't tooo sweet but it was sweet enough to fulfill my dessert cravings. **Eat it while its hot and fresh, that's when it's best.**"
1769,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Came with no line today. Disappointed because the red bean and taro cake that I ordered was just warmed up for me. However, I still enjoyed it--Delicious!  Not very sweet and brimming with filling.  Cost - $5.00 (2.50 each)"
1770,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"A very tiny shop and you will probably pass by without attention. But try this! I have red bean and sesame & cream wheel cakes. It's definitely sweet but it's not like the sugar sweet. I guess for those people who don't usually have something sweet like me still enjoy their dessert. BTW, people there are nice:)"
1771,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Haven't had it for ages. I miss them.  Thank god that I found this place from a friend.  I got two radish, red bean/cream, sesame/cream, and taro/cream.  I just eat one of read bean/cream, and it tastes so good."
1772,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Taste really good. If you need some snacks after the meal, this will be the go place!"
1773,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,All I can think is how much I regret not getting more!! Absolutely delicious!! Just hope they open a spot somewhere closer like in Manhattan that'd be great!
1774,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,Lovely!! Can't believe this authentic flavors are actually can be found in New York metropolitan area. My #1 vote to all ever
1775,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"This was my first time trying a Taiwanese wheel cake (surprisingly, since I am Taiwanese American).Happy Wheelie is tucked away in the back of an indoor mall, or as the owner likes to call it, a little night market. The owner told us about her own personal story of how she started Happy Wheelie as a pop up/home store, then branched into her own location in Flushing to share her fond memory of this Taiwanese dessert with the rest of New York.My partner and I tried five different flavors of the wheel cake: red bean, cream, taro & cream, oreo, and radish. Our favorite one turned out to be the radish one, which is a savory cake. The radish is mixed with some spices, including black pepper. So delicious! Our other favorites included the cream and taro flavor - the taro used is real taro, and gives a burst of taro flavor as soon as you bite into the cake.You can get two cakes for $5. Would recommend anyone stopping by Flushing to check out this little gem!"
1776,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Nice red bean stuffing .. waffle la....... try try Sweet treat breakfast, lunch or dinner .."
1777,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,A hidden gem in Flushing! This place is tucked away in the back of one of the many mini food-malls in the area. It's a small stall that sells a variety of wheel cakes - a Taiwanese street snack similar to Korean fish bread (bungeobbang) and Japanese imagawayaki. Taro and custard were our favorite flavors!
1778,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Place is amazing. Oreo was delicious! If you're not into sweets, they have the radish wheelie too. Can't believe I can get a taste of Taiwan right here."
1779,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Very small shop in the back of the mall but I'm so glad I found it! We got the red bean with cream and Oreo. They were both delicious and they are very generous with the filling, which I find very important. Overall they were freshly made and delicious and the shop owner was very kind."
1780,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Delicious and love, love the fact that they're not too sweet. I hope they can retain that feature because it allows the natural flavor of the filling to shine (plus is healthier than excess sugar ;). I only had the taro one so far but cannot wait to try more. Props to the owner for being friendly and pleasant, and to his adorable little girl. Love all the Taiwan memorabilia too! My mom said she prefers the outside to be more crisp because that's how she remembers them, but I personally liked the texture - I guess it's personal preference!"
1781,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I tried both sesame and red bean wheel cake. They are quite good, and not too sweet but I find they are quite expensive given how small the cake is. The filling takes up more than half the cake, but I still feel it is too expensive at $2.50 each."
1782,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Hot and fresh authentic Taiwanese red bean wheel cake!! They have many flavors but butter flavor is favorite. The service is fast and courteous, it's a nice dessert after lunch or dinner."
1783,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I keep coming back to this place since their opening. Totally recommended! Their wheel cakes are really delicious and authentic, just like the ones I had in Taiwan when I was young. I only like the traditional flavors though (red bean, cream, and radish). Taro is also not bad. The creative flavors (oreo and sesame cream) are a bit strange to me."
1784,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"The best Taiwanese wheel cake boutique in town. I'm originally from Taiwan and this is as authentic as you can get in Taiwan. For non-Taiwanese, this is one of the best desserts/snacks/finger foods that you should try. Crispy on the outside while several different kinds of stuffings that you can choose inside There are like 8 choices for stuffings; most are sweet but one or two are savory. My personal favorite is taro, a little like creamy mushed potato, but smells and tastes better. Definitely worth trying it!"
1785,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Wheel cake is one of my favor Taiwanese desserts . I am so happy to see this shop in Flushing. The most important thing is that the wheels taste soso good! I love cream and Taro , my son loves Oreo. I will be  back whenever I go to Flushing."
1786,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,Authentic Taiwanese style and super friendly host! Not an easy find in NYC. Been lived overseas for a years and I'm happy to have found Wheelie. Recommend red bean cream and taro cream 紅豆奶油 芋頭奶油
1787,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,Took 20 minuets to get 2 buns (taro and red bean with cream). Yet there were people coming in and out with theirs. I was getting super confused. I was the only one there at one point and nothing. Not only was it a 20 min wait but the woman forgot to add my order (red bean and cream) but she was like is just red bean okay? I was over it and said yeah sure.
1788,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"The wheelie is surprisingly delicious! The sweetness of the filling is perfect, not too sweet and over powering. They have a good selection of different flavors and that was another surprise to me too. Everything tastes good!"
1789,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I discovered this place while I was waiting for rice roll orders today.   I bought two red beans.  They are just okay.   Not sweet but also no taste.   One good thing is they are fresh, make to order so you have to wait.  I might go back and try different flavors."
1790,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"We were so happy to find this place. Ordered 8 for $20. Every flavor except sesame. After we got home, there were only 7 inside.Very disappointed.make sure you check before leaving"
1791,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"For me, the cakes contain the perfect amount of sweetness. Black sesame was my favorite. The red bean and cream one was pretty good too. I was looking forward to the taro and cream, but thought it was a bit bland. $2.50 per cake is on the pricey side, but I will definitely come back to try out other flavors."
1792,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,I appreciate the flavors they offer as it was more then i expected. The dessert is pretty solid and not so sweet and the service was nice.
1793,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"I just don't think it's worth the price.  Nothing really special.  Mind wasn't even hot, it's not even warm...it's more like room temperature...I guess I was more expecting the Chinese Egg raffle that's freshly made and hot."
1794,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"Delicious cakes, especially the black sesame cream combo. Addictive! And really friendly service! I love that they make your cakes to order, right in front of you. Will be back!"
1795,V4LITE6wXdAD4LGdTT2_Zg,"pretty decent. ordered two oreo, taro and red bean. the only thing that was bugging me was the wait time. it took about fifteen minutes to make my order and the staff who were making the dessert would forget which flavor each wheelie was after closing them up."
1796,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Great customer service and great food. I had the fried chicken, jerk chicken, curry goat, and seafood soup on my last visit. Everything was delicious and flavorful. They never disappoint. I would definitely recommend."
1797,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Really makes me feel sad to give only a 2 star. Since they've remodeled the customer service has disappeared.  The decor is more modern and updated but they now lack with the staff and food portions. If you order a large oxtail you will pay $15 and receive 5 pieces of oxtail with mass amount of gravy in a container full of rice. Unbelievable! Dont bother ordering your food in advance over the phone (if they even answer) you will still wait a  minimum of 30 minutes before receiving it. The food is good but they are incredibly stingy with the meat portions on top of that the cashiers have the nastiest attitude. Honestly its no longer worth it I would recommend either blue cantina or richie rich.
1798,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,I was craving Jamaican food. This was the only spot in the area open late Friday night. They had a small crowd. Inside was spacious and very clean. The wait for your food was less than 5 min. The woman in the front spoke very loud so you could pick up your order. My food was delicious and hot. I'll try to come earlier next time since I really wanted the Mac and cheese. But overall I had a fine experience. The Rasta pasta had too much onions and I needed more sauce on my jerk chicken. Overall food is fresh and delicious.
1799,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Came here on a Friday night real late. They where still open and it had a small crowd. Inside was spacious and very clean. The wait for your food was less than 5 min. The woman in the front spoke very loud so you could pick up your order. My food was delicious and hot. I'll try to come earlier next time since I really wanted the Mac and cheese. But overall I had a fine experience.
1800,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Hmmm smh you definitely don't get what you pay for. Sorry to say and it's seems to have gotten worst since the renovation. Food is tasty , service not terrible, value not there"
1801,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,I ordered take out here and thoroughly enjoyed it. I had the escovitch fish and chips which is a great spin on your normal fish when escovitch sauce and pickled veggies are added! I also tried the shrimp fried rice which was delicious! Good authentic caribbean cuisine and also adding other cuisine to Jamaican style like Italian and Chinese. Great menu ..I'll cone again and try other dishes!
1802,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"They have good food but the service was abysmal. No communication and they just there helping everyone but us. We ordered 3 items but it took us over 20 minutes to leave the restaurant, which is more of a quick service location. They also did not have a bunch of items on the menu, which made the process even more annoying.I'm giving them two stars because the first time I used here was for their catering service and that was really good, before their renovation. However, the new look came with a new attitude I guess."
1803,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Fried chicken with rice and peas always on point. Consistency is key and this restaurant never fails me . Customer service is okay, the staff is not very friendly or easy to approach. When speaking to them it's as if u are asking for a favor. Due to the chef I will continue to purchase food from this restaurant. Typical for a Jamaican restaurant but the food is actually worth it."
1804,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"I'm making my rounds with these Jamaican restaurants in the Bronx, and Rocatone is def top three!! The rice and peas are sooo good! Curry chicken isn't bad either, and the jerk chicken was moist and flavorful. Aseguce was prompt, and I had no issues using the Groupon which turned out to be a great deal. Plenty of food for a great price. Also very cool decor inside."
1805,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,I actually like the food there. I'm pescatarian and I love their options. Usually get the veggie Roti!! Cooks fresh from order so you might want to preorder or expect a 15 min wait.  Great folks and attitude. Four stars because I'm still feeling them out. But I will become a regular. Oh and please get their seafood soup(a large because you'll want more)!!!!!!! My gosh.
1806,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Love. Love. Love. This is the place to go to get authentic Jamaican food. The food is always fresh. I get the curry chicken every time. My mom and sister loves the jerk chicken and the fried chicken and my dad always gets the oxtails. Have already  recommended this place to a few family and friends.
1807,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Food not consistent. Rude service most of the time. Taste gets worse every time I order from here ! Plantains are always Tuff!! Curry goat and stew peas has a weird taste and the rice and peas is mushy. Don't go there man. Not worth the price and headache.
1808,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Honestly I'm from the area best food and best service fresh good plates authentic , just small don't try eat here it's basically take out but super nice thank u"
1809,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"The moment when you finally had a chance to try the small Seafood soup and drove all the way to Long Island to find out the small wasn't enough.... *sad face*I also had the jerk chicken with red beans and rice (yes, I was hungry. Don't judge.) I didn't think it was that spicy at first but then it crept up on me like strong liquor. Just how I like it. I can count on one hand how many times I'm in the Bronx, but I will travel for good food."
1810,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Man listen since they fixed the place up the food has stepped up 10times better the staff respectful it's comfortable the food was of the charts and let me say this I have had a lot of fried chicken from West Indian spots nothing to write home about this place the fried chicken was amazing this is gonna be my regular spot much respect to the cooking staff
1811,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Came in yesterday ordered curry chicken rice and cabbage with extra gravy I swear I got a small serving of rice bones with Lil meat cabbage was hard and a drop of gravy I didn't go back cause I didn't want to go through the drama I won't be going here again.
1812,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Food is on point love there curry goat and rice always same flavor same taste, great working staff real nice respectful and they give your money worth"
1813,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Has some good food to offer,your typical jamaican restaurant in the gritty streets of  uptown Bronx. Their goat head soup is okay if your feeling ill. I typically order on grubhub or uber eats when ordering from here. Rice and peas and fried chicken are a special"
1814,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,The service is very good and the food is delicious my favorite  is the brown stew chicken  always nice and tender with a nice sauce definitely recommend this place
1815,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Food is always OKAY .. today I decided to try them again instead of Goldstar . I ordered the oxtail .. MISTAKE ! They were very SKIMP like Iver never seen smaller pieces. I then asked for an extra side of plantain in place of the veggies that came with my order (i paid extra) ... I get home and the rice is dry and there are only TWO PLANTAINS in my box. Smh last time I'll be going back .
1816,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,One of the best Jamaican restaurants in the Bronx even better than Richie Rich. Curry goat is mouth watering and the  fried chicken is pretty good  Customer service is awesome.
1817,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"I ordered a small fried chicken with rice and peas with oxtail gravy. The plate was basically rice and cabbage. Literally not even a full piece of chicken. Not a leg, breast, or thigh in sight. And when I called to complain they told me to take a picture and show it the next time I come. Nope, never again. The portions are TINY."
1818,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"This is s local Jamaican take our spot.  Love their oxtail , red snapper, and lunch jerk chicken.  It's usually packed so call ahead."
1819,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Rocatone is Great for some Caribean Delights. The Food is made to order so expect a wait. I am consist on the day I order and constantly have the pleasure of being assisted by Shanteca. AKA  Ms B. She is Always kind, courteous,  professional and on point she  makes patrionizing the establishment a pleasure. The new decor elevate the flare and ambiance of this quaint Bronx eatery. The Menu has a variety of dishes so enjoy.   You will be pleased with the portions the prices and service."
1820,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"I am a fan of the food. I'm new to the area and heard the location was remodeled. I'm a Yankee, so I generally stick with the stew chicken (brown) which I am a big fan of. I also like the Mac and cheese. Just be sure to call in orders as it can be hectic on the weekend. Also be on the lookout as they frequently have deals on Groupon."
1821,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,So after these reviews I decided to give them a try for myself. Yesterday I used UberEATS to order my food and it took damn near an hr to get to me but I ordered a medium oxtail with white rice and fried plantains. The food was good I must say better than most places. The oxtail was tender and flavorful and not sugary sweet like most places.
1822,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"Always a hit, never a miss when I visit this restaurant. They have a ton load of  delicious dishes to choose from morning, noon and night... One of the best Jamaican cuisine restaurants in the tri-state area!!! Stop by today and see what you've been missing."
1823,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"I've sampled many Caribbean restaurants in the Bronx and this is definitely amongst my top 3. I frequent this place pretty much every weekend and I'm very familiar with the staff as they are with me. I've even hosted a school event and had them cater it. The fried chicken here is AMAZING. Only place around that has comparable fried chicken is Richie Rich Caribbean restaurant... Wouldn't be surprised if it was the same chef at both places. Their seafood is made to order and always fresh. The curry chicken is also very good and although I'm not a big fan of tomato based brown stew chicken, there's is also very good. Also, their Chinese menu is legit surprisingly. I've had their chicken fried rice numerous times and highly recommend it... Tastes wonderful! Downside is seating is very limited as this is primarily a take out restaurant but the upside is they accept credit cards!"
1824,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,I'm from Miami and this is the first spot I found that sells conch in the five boroughs! It was delicious! Their curry crab and jerk salmon with rice and peas and mac and cheese was the best foodgasm I've had in a long time! This spot is definitely my go-to when I don't want to cook! Keep providing those succulent flavorful dishes - we love them!!
1825,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,We always purchase Groupons. They catered my sons first birthday. Never disappointed! Wish they expanded as a dine in.
1826,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"There Food Is Good don't get me wrong , but the portions are just getting smaller and smaller"
1827,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"I was very dissappointed with the level of service at Roc a tone.  I ordered a few items for my thanksgiving dinner and was outraged when I showed up to pick up my items and discovered the following:I ordered potato salad - I received freakin mash potatoOrdered a toss salad - no salad was included and when I inquired i was told they only had steamed veggies and I had to wait 10 minutes for it be prepared.Ordered what I thought was escoviched whole tilapia fish - received fried tilapia fillet.  I was livid.  Someone who i think was the manage came to ""speak"" with me. she was useless as she just stared at me like a dear caught in the headlights.  Just to clarify this situation.  On my initiatal order - the young lady on the told me they had sliced fish and tilapia to made this dish.  I as MOST JAMAICANS would assumed the tilapia would be the whole fish and the other option was sliced.  This was not explained on the phone.  And ofcourse the escoviched sauce was missing...I had to wait another 10 minutes for them to prepare.  I was floored by the level of service and poor attention to details that was showed to my catering order.,..that said i WOULD NEVER EAT HERE AGAIN or recommend to friends."
1828,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,I would like for this restaurant to make authentic jerk chicken. I brought jerk chicken but I got baked chicken with jerk sauce. Tip-please make chicken on a charcoal grill not in the oven.
1829,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,Their food is good but customer service is terrible! They need to have two people working the window and two lines. People feel because they placed orders over the phone they can just come in and skip the ENTIRE line and walk to the front of the line. The woman at the window said absolutely nothing about this happening. She clearly was overwhelmed with phone calls and the length of the line I am surprised no one came to help her out. I know that they can improve the quality of their business especially if you HIRE someone to help the one person out.
1830,mt44XPN43DUcZUSPLgQ8zw,"If your looking for some tasty Jamaican food, look know further.  The stew peas, seafood soup, curry shrimp, fried chicken and oxtail is to die for."
1831,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Kelly is the dopest bartender ever !! But this place is a def! The food is so bomb and the drinks are Amazing. I also love the vibes here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu I promise. P.S  tip the bartenders !
1832,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,One of the better Caribbean spots in Harlem. Was looking for a spot and this place didn't disappoint. I ordered the oxtails which was full of flavor but would have been much better if the dish was larger. The shrimp Rasta pasta was delicious and not overly cheesy.
1833,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"I truly enjoyed my time here. Had a rough start due to the kitchen being a bit backed up, but once we received our meals we were extremely happy. It was explained that the wait was because the food is made to order and once you taste it, you'll gladly wait. Also had Henny punches that were strong, as they should be. I highly recommend this place and the staff was wonderful."
1834,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This is truly a hidden gem of a spot - amazing drinks from a personable bartender and delicious food! I had the curry shrimp and the flavors were fantastic - I asked for spicy and boy did they deliver! It was a zing with all the spices - loved it! Also the sides such as the rice and beans were so good. How could something so simple be compacted and soft enough to melt in your mouth? My friend got the brown stew chicken which was so tender and juicy, with great marinade and flavors that really sank in. The only thing I warn is the service seems a little short staffed, so food can take a while. But it's definitely worth the wait. And the servers make this up by being caring and friendly. Truly a Jamaican vibe!!"
1835,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Excellent food. The jerk chicken was songood and the server was excellent. Highly recommended restaurant.
1836,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"The food was great and it is a nice, cozy restaurant. I recommend the Jerk Chicken. Make sure you get a side of macaroni and cheese; it was fantastic!"
1837,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"We had a great Jamaican dinner and drinks here! Our empanada starter was crispy, light and airy, filled with moist jerk chicken, with a very spicy dip on the side. I had the Jerk Chicken with plaintains, rice and peas for dinner and my daughter had the whole Snapper fish with plaintains, rice and peas and spicy red and green peppers. Big portions! Our drinks were the Bob Marley and Sex on a Mountain. Out of IPA tonight and so we both had Coronas. Enough food to take some home! Warm, friendly, welcoming servers. High energy, intimate, popular busy local bar/restaurant with reggae, hip-hop, rap playing ramped up :-). Would definitely return."
1838,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Great service but the food didn't taste very Caribbean. Don't get me wrong it was good but the Rasta pasta was more like a good Mac and cheese. Maybe if I had something else it would have been good but my friend  enjoyed the empanada. Customer service was excellent
1839,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Wow just wow. This. Chef. Can. Cook! Do you hear me?!?!?! We're my exact words! The food is amazing! We had fritters, jerk chicken, oxtail, rice n peas with vegetables and festival. Staff is amazing and drinks are good and skkkrong! Bathroom is clean so it makes 5 stars in my book. A little drafty so if you want to dine in on a cold winter day dress warm! So worth it - loved every bite! Will definitely return!!! So glad this place is here!"
1840,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This place is ok. Went on a Thursday evening after work with a big group and the bartender was acting shady by charging us full price on drinks when it was supposedly happy hour. Drinks are watered down with little to no liquor, I had a rum punch and pina colada with no buzz. How do you pass out ""happy hour menus"" then once we start ordering you tell us ""oh happy hour is over"" but have been charging us full price for the whole hour we've been there earlier!! Extremely long wait for just  appetizers not even entrees which make no sense, staff was very unapologetic about how slow they are. Food was decent. This place needs proper management and faster chef because they can't handle large groups at all!"
1841,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,As an added bonus.... I walk by this place daily and can confirm they've consistently maintained a Grade A inspection record.
1842,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"A hidden gem in the upper 150s!!  A true diamond in the rough!  Their off-the-beaten-path, mid-block location on W 158 St between Amsterdam and St Nick contributes to this place's magic!  (And if it weren't a bit out of the way, I'm certain you'd never be able to get a table!). Blue Mountain has a really chill, comfortable vibe!  The interior is finished with beautiful wood and stone which feel very warm and earthy. The space is divided into a cafe area (which is a nice daytime spot to enjoy a coffee and read the paper) and the bar area.   In the evening the cafe area affords a more intimate atmosphere for a quiet dinner or date.  The bar area has a great neighborhood feel. It's social without being overbearing, loud, or rowdy  (I'm not sure how sports might change that.  There is a tv in the bar, but it hasn't been on when I've been there.)  In warm weather tall windows open to the sidewalk which is awesome.   The bartender, Rika (apologies if I've misspelled), is awesome!!! The Rum Punch that she makes to order with fresh fruit and juice is a must!! The food is amazing-- very fresh, homemade-- the chef has mad skills.  The ox tail is heaven...melts in your mouth without being greasy or fatty.  The seafood curry was super fresh and delicious -- even the saltfish was perfect!!   My ex-boyfriend was Bahamian, his cousin and her gf would come visit for New Year's Eve every year. I can remember her calling from the taxi saying, ""We in the taxi.  Put the oil on!!""  When she walked through the door she would pull out a big tub of conch fritter batter that she went down to the dock that morning to buy.  I've been craving those fritters since we split up 17 years ago...damnit!And while you can, of course, get conch in NYC it tends to be expensive and was not pulled out of the ocean this morning.  Blue Mountain however makes a saltfish fritter that Is like heaven.  I highly recommend them!!!You've got to check this place out.  The atmosphere is awesome and the food is amazing!!   They also do fun stuff for holidays like jerk chicken cooked on a charcoal grill on the sidewalk in the summer and special events for mother's/father's day etc.   Take the C to 163 or the 1 to 157.  It's definitely worth the trip!!"
1843,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"The food here was great. Oxtails with steamed vegetables and peas and rice was my meal. Oxtails fall off the bones, and Well seasoned."
1844,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Went for brunch on a Sunday after church. Brunch menu was quite limited imo. The jerk chicken empanadas were tasty but the pasta with shrimp was a bit salty. I wanted a Bloody Mary but they didn't have tomatoe juice. Had the rum punch instead . Staff was very friendly and very accommodating. Looking forward to going back to try the oxtails!
1845,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Great food, Great drinks, Great service. Prices are reasonable. Enjoyed the low key atmosphere with authentic Caribbean music playing. Me and my sister had the oxtail meal and the chef cooked it to perfection. Oxtails weren't fatty and yes they fell off the bone. This is truly a hidden Harlem gem. Definitely will make this one of my favorite places."
1846,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Went here on 6/1 and was glad i did. Service was great. Drinks were nice n strong. The pepper shrimp lived up to it's name. Servers were reallly nicea and pleasant. Food too a little long but allin all. Will definately go again.
1847,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Great ambience, great customer service, GREAT FOOD! What more can you ask for? The chef personally asked how the food was. They asked about allergies. It's definitely a gem in the Heights. Please try the pistachio cheesecake!   I will definitely be back."
1848,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,No one answers phone. No message. No sign on business indicating temporary closure.
1849,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This Restaurant ALWAYS cancels my orders! Why are they on Yelp or Seamless then? There food is good, I ate there twice! But they do not seem to accept online orders! The orders go through, but 2-3 minutes after, I get a cancellation notice. Oh well, guess I will not bother ordering from them anymore!"
1850,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,I visited Blue Mountain last week for dinner with my niece.  We started with really tasty drinks.  The bartender was very creative and  personable.  My niece started with  the jerk chicken empanadas--she LOVED them (I dont eat chicken).  She had the curry goat--loved it.  I had the steam snapper--really tasty.  We closed with the pistachio cheesecake--to die for.the owner indicated they are open until 3am--gotta love NYC.  the owner indicated he cooks the BEST oxtail.  I will have someone order that the next time I visit with friends  I am definitely going back and would recommend this spot for good Jamaican food.
1851,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,This is a hidden treasure. I am excited that I found it and it is worth it. Adding it to my list of go to restaurants. I also must add the staff is so nice and welcoming.
1852,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Blue Mountain has hit the mark with authentic Jamaican food In Washington heights!! Jerk chicken with peas and rice was nice and rich. You can taste the Coconut flavor in the rice. The jerk sauce was the right consistency and spicy enough to give your taste buds the spark! Rum punch for drinks!I will for sure  return!
1853,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Giving them two stars now because the wait times are absolutely deplorable. As I'm sure you'll see from the existing reviews, they usually don't have delivery b/c they either don't have a delivery man available or they've ran out of everything under the sun. I called for pick up today... a simple order of jerk chicken and rice and peas. I was quoted 15 minutes by the bartender/waitress. I come down in about 25 minutes to give them a little time. I get there and my food isn't ready. The bartender/waitress tells me it should be 5 more minutes. I step out and come back in 7 minutes. Is my food ready? No. I ask how does 15 minutes become about 40? She tells me that my food will be ready ""right now"" I cut her off and ask should I come back at 8pm, which is an entire hour after I've ordered mind you, she says yes. I come back at 8:10 and finally my food is ready... and lukewarm mind you. Don't order from here if you don't have the time of day because they clearly cannot get it together. And let me also add that when I finally did get to eat my food, I realized that my jerk chicken was ice cold... so there you have it."
1854,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"First off, let me say that I'm glad the Heights finally has some decent Caribbean food because constantly going down to 145th and lower couldn't keep being the move; however, I will say that while the food here is good, it's pretty pricey especially for the portions that you get. I can pay $12-$14 for oxtail and two sides at places a little further down as opposed to the $18-$20 that it is here. On another note, their delivery can be hit or miss. I tried to order from them a couple of times within the past couple of weeks and my order got cancelled b/c they ran out of food."
1855,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"I just had lunch at this restaurant! The experience and Food deserves 5 stars, the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the location(near Columbia Hospital) the parking sucks! When I got there the restaurant was empty. I was greeted by the chef and he was warm and gracious just like you experience in Jamaica! I ordered Hennessy wings as an appetizer. The wings comes with dumplings. The wings have a nice Hennessy glaze. Not overwhelming, but just right. Dumplings were fresh and amazing. As we ate two more members of the staff arrived and as they walked through the door they came in asking if we were ok and if we needed anything else! I love being treated like a valued customer! I placed my drink order which was a rum punch and my honey had a ginger beer! I consider myself a rum punch expert, and this rum punch strongly mirrored one of the best I've had! Two rum punches will send you sailing! I ordered the curry shrimp and my honey had the escovitch red snapper. The food was fresh and flavorful! It was served hot and with a smile! I didn't finish all of my food and took the rest to go, meanwhile my Bae killed his fish, and got a jerk chicken dinner to go! The vibes and music of Blue Mountain are great, the customer service is amazing and the food is A+. Most importantly the prices are wonderful! 3 meals and an appetizer and drink under $70.00!! You can't find good food and quality service for that kind of money! The restaurant is small and I can imagine it gets quite crowded when it's busy, but nonetheless they have got a returning customer in me! Make sure you stop by, you will NOT be disappointed!"
1856,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"First time here. Rum punch was on point and the food was delicious. We will definitely be going back.The staff was friendly and attentive,"
1857,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Huge delicious portions at an extremely affordable price, and a very friendly and accommodating staff. Cute space as well. We had jerk chicken and oxtail - so so good, and had enough leftover to eat for lunch the next day. Everything you would want from a neighborhood restaurant."
1858,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This is a late review, but I had my 31st birthday here back in November, just a couple weeks after the restaurant first opened. At the far left side of the bar, there was a woman celebrating her 80th birthday. We ended up celebrating together, and it turned out to be one of the most memorable birthdays of my life! The staff was so warm and hospitable, and my fiancée and I have been back three or four times since then. The jerk chicken is delicious and the oxtail melts in your mouth, but, again, it's the staff that really has us coming back over and over. Thanks for the great service and an unforgettable night!"
1859,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,Great place. My boyfriend and I had the henny wings perfectly glazed and seasoned. I also has the long island blue punch very strong and sweet I enjoyed it and was worth the money it was strong. My boyfriend had the jerk chicken plate and I had the oxtail plate we both chose sweet plantains over the salad and also it comes with rice and beans. This food was amazing! My boyfriend jerk chicken was perfectly seasoned and spicy my oxtail was sooo nicely cooked that the meat will fall off the bones it was amazing. I've been to Jamaica and I've had authentic Jamaican food and trust me this food took me back! It's a hidden gem in the heights! The sweet plantains were sooo sweet and soft just perfect. I met the chef because I told the waitress to give him my compliments and how amazed and satisfied I was with the food. Great gentleman his name is Steven he comes straight from Jamaica and told me how this is his passion and he puts his heart soul and all his love into this food and trust me y'all you can tell! Great prices great food.
1860,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Great food, great service...can't wait to go back.  It was worth driving in the rain/snow storm.  The Hennessy wings and festival are to die for.  The seafood platter was scrumptious.  The chef and staff are very friendly.  Nice cozy spot!"
1861,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Best place in Washington Heights for that real, home cooked Jamakcan meal without the plane ticket."
1862,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"For a long time, I wasn't sure what this place was trying to be but I went in this morning and am excited by what they have in store for the neighborhood - soon to be adding brunch and lunch. Lunch will be especially welcome considering the lack of decent/interesting options around here. So I am reserving one star for future review... while giving them 4 stars for the delicious iced coffee. SO MUCH BETTER than Dunkin' Donuts and CHEAPER!"
1863,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,This is a really comfortable & relaxed vibe.  Great bar & really good food.  I came to hang out on a Saturday at 6 pm and stayed until close.  The DJ was spinning old reggae and dancehall.  Very Fun. I'll be back.
1864,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,I came here on the recommendation of colleagues after a Parent teacher conference. I was definitely in the mood for a rum punch and the hostess/ bartender/ public relations representative did not disappoint. The service was attentive and focused on meeting our needs. My boyfriend and I had the salt fish fritters to start which was really good and pleasantly spicy. We followed up with the jerk chicken plate which was super well spiced and well priced for the portion. Enjoyed the vibes here (relaxed and welcoming) and would certainly come back.
1865,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Wonderful Ambiance I loved my seating area. The service was phenomenal they were very attentive to us. Provided excellent service. The food was also phenomenal, delicious the waitress/bartender was amazing.  Loved it!!"
1866,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"I've passed this place a million times wanting to try it. I actually remember the day they opened. I stopped in to take a look their very first day to wish them well and said I'd be back. I finally came in tonight to order 2 appetizers to go. It was not very busy when I walked in. Only a few tables were occupied and 2 people at the bar. I ordered and after about 20 minutes of waiting, I was told that one of the two was not available, so I picked another. I waited another 15 minutes to check on the order, as it was now 35 minutes that I was waiting. The kitchen door was open right next to where I was sitting at the counter so I asked the chef. He kind of laughed and told me about another 10 minutes. That would make 45 minutes of waiting for two appetizers. There was no, ""we're so sorry"" or ""we're really busy today."" 45 minutes seems more than a bit unreasonable so I left. Now I wasted 35 minutes sitting there and had no food. I then had to go find somewhere else and start all over again. I wish them well. It sounds like they do have great food but I won't be returning. This is NYC, I always travel for good food so I'll just find somewhere else if I want good Jamaican food. Even if I travel an hour, it would probably end up being the same when you factor in the wait time."
1867,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This place is a hidden gem in Washington Heights. If you know, you know! The food is amazing, the drinks are top shelf and in large variety, and the ambience gives off an authentic Caribbean vibe. The Seafood Platter is a favorite, but so everything on the menu. I've been multiple times. Recommending to all my friends."
1868,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"First time here, really enjoyed everything. It seems to be a family owned establishment which i'm always down to support. The decor was nice and the food was great too. Everything was decently priced and proportioned perfectly. Will definitely be back."
1869,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This review is for the bartender, when I go to a restaurant, I want to have a good time, good food and food drinks. Blue mountain has only good food because your drink mixing game is not on point. I have gone to Blue more then 10 times because I love the people that work there and I see that they value me as a customer. You ""the bartender"" carry yourself like you don't care and that's how the drinks taste. They taste watery I am a light drinker and I always leave the same way I came in 100% sober you fuck up orders and the chef always seems upset with you. ( I love the chef because he takes care of everyone if she confuses him he will walk to your table and in the most polite way ask you how you want your food done and much more he is awesome. ) the waitresses have only been there twice since I started going and those to times I had the best food. Blue please fix this bartender problem because I have try taking friends there and they said no matter how good the food is they won't go back because she makes bad drinks. Please fix it because I love you guys."
1870,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This place... is the Bomb. Let me start of my saying that, the staff is amazing,from the Chef to the delivery guy. They remind me of being back home, of how Caribbean people treat each other life family. Thank you guys. Now let's get to the food. It was so good,my best friend and I had the 45$ food platter, with every kind of sea food you could imagine on it. The platter is also really big so their food portions are amazing. It was sooooooooooo Good. I went yesterday ,and I am thinking about going back today. Their food is so welled season, you taste everything on it. The platter takes a while to come out, because it's being prepare to perfection, so don't get upset because it will be worth the wait. I also love that is a black owned business. I've told everyone I know about them. I hope they see a lot of success."
1871,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This place is awesome.  Authenticity and warmth, and great service.  The jerk chicken empanadas are highly addictive.  Pepper shrimp were offered up as free ""tapas."" With a rum punch to boot, my night is off to a great start!"
1872,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Ok so I been here a few times and I think I'm ready to give my option and review about this place 1st let me start with the food taste it's awesome excellent great quality and taste, a lil over price and unclear about menus what comes with items but then again that part may be because of the next issue I'm going to talk about. if that all that matters to you as a customer yes I say go here shit go everyday but if you also want quality  service then no the waitress her rika give this place a horrible look and it's sad because as long as she here they will loose customers she nasty rude and bossy to the people over her and customs she over charges ppl and charge u for things that suppose to come with your order so ppl READY YOUR Receiptsand if u say anything to her is a bunch of eye rolling thresh sucking I guess her working there mean more to the own then making money and keeping his doors open."
1873,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,A wonderful neighborhood restaurant with amazing staff and excellent food. They stayed open for us and were extremely kind.
1874,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,I rely on views so i make sure I leave a review and I'll be leaving this everywhere this place is advertised This was probably one of the worst places to eat at if you're looking for good customer service and food I didn't try the drinks so I can't comment on that but I did see people coming in just for the bar My partner and I came here to eat the server didn't seem happy at all until her male friend came to visit after that she was all smiles but back to the food and service my partner and I ordered before a table the same appetizers actually we got our appetizer after that table we ordered our food and appetizers at the same time the table next to us who came after still got both before us my partner got her food shortly after the appetizers she was done with her plate and my food still hadn't come the restaurant isn't full not one bit the only people here are me my partner the table next to us and two people at the bar not once did anyone say our food was on the way it will be out shortly nothing the table beside us is almost done with they food and my food still isn't here my partner had to get up and ask about my plate of food I'm completely turned off so if you're looking to eat at the same time as the person you came with please do not bank on this place The Mac and cheese has no flavor the shrimp was very good tho I'm very disappointed I wish our people would take more pride in their establishment customers is what keeps the business going and if you aren't catering and serving the customers what are you doing Texting and having friends visit will not keep an establishment open nor the bills paid!I will not return back to this establishment the food nor treatment is worth it
1875,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,This place is a hidden treasure!!! Excellent Food. Great staff!! The seafood dishes are a must try.
1876,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"Blue Mountain Heights gives you the warm friendly vibes you would experience in the Caribbean. Good food, clean establishment and attentive staff. Happy to have a Black-owned family restaurant in my neighborhood. Definitely a spot I would recommend to ALL looking for authentic Caribbean cuisine!"
1877,Xd4Ahhb1alLxBapbcTl4Nw,"This is such a great restaurant! I am very glad I stumbled upon it in Washington Heights. I highly recommend the jerk chicken and rum punch. The decor, playlist, and service were all superb. I would definitely visit again."
1878,Ww_N2_uYbFc9I3CzMV8-fw,"Old Italian Bronx style pizzeria, had plain cheese and grandma slice, nice chat with the guy behind desk! Small restaurant with a few seats inside, sits on the corner, just around from the train station!"
1879,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"Alright guys, we gotta give the whole authenticity snobbery a rest. Like ""Rest In Peace"" rest, because Chinese Take Out is delicious and the faster we accept that, the faster we can achieve eternal bliss.Fresco's Tortilla has become somewhat of a local legend. In fairy tales, there's always some element of magic and a hero involved. The hero being the chefs and the magic being how unbelievably crispy they make ALL of their chicken WITHOUT that greasy feeling accompanied by your self-loathing. The villain in this story are the weight watchers ads on repeat shaming you. Don't ever let anyone tell you you're not the strong, independent, woman that you were born to be.You might have to request ""extra cripsy"" just to be safe but trust me, it's worth the insurance... unlike car insurance. My personal favorite is the sesame chicken. I'm all about texture and I constantly find myself craving this dish. I think I've even conditioned myself to get hungry on the train ride to my friend's house, who lives near by. Other fried dishes well known are the regular 4 wings and buffalo chicken.The mexican food.. err. You can find out for yourself. And a caveat, late late night (right before closing) may not procure the desired results. I'd still order because seriously, what the hell else is there around?"
1880,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,All I have done was grab a menu and order my food and I was greeted by a friend. I should have known better with the grade B on the window that I should have walked one more block for decent food without the side of babies roaches!
1881,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,Decent Mexican and Chinese food. This is the type of place that you get what you pay for. If you are ok we mediocre Mexican and Chinese this would be a good spot as it also is pretty cheap.
1882,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"My grand kids love this local Chinese spot.  She likes the wings and rice, very simple dish.  He loves the chicken Lo mein"
1883,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"I called and ordered my food yesterday for delivery. As I started the order the woman on the phone stopped started screaming in her native tongue and then started talking to me. I was a bit confused but continued to order. When the order arrived I received the incorrect items. I called back and in the process of explaining what I ordered she started screaming at me. I guess it was the language barrier, but she indicated that the price went up and I asked her the difference and she repeated the order. This was a back and forth where I  I asked for the difference in price or just the price and she repeated the order. So you hear her frustration building and it led to her to be more inaudible. So at last she got that I wanted to know the difference in costs for the food. But in the process she became upset and you can hear her frustrating. Fine I thought she took my order correctly. The new order came and it was still incorrect. I called and asked what happened, she then started screaming on the phone and I truly could not understand her. As I was asking her something, she spoke over me and then hung up. I called back and asked why did she hang up. She said she told me ok no problem and hung up. I asked why when I was in the middle of a sentence and she truly did not say that. At this point she was speaking over me as I was asking her about my order. And then she said ok then talk. So as I am speaking and asking her questions she refused to speak. I asked numerous times why isn't she responding and she refused to speak and I hung up. I went down to the store and brought the wrong food back, asked for my money back and asked to get the food comped. After talking it out she agreed and said the delivery guy just left. At first we were communicating well and I think she did this because there were customers in the store. Essentially she said that the delivery guy made the mistake of sending the wrong order and that she said goodbye on the phone. I told her it was poor customer service. So she gives me only 20 of the 26 bucks (I paid extra when I asked for my replacement because she alleged it cost more). I argued it was incorrect but the language barrier was an issue so I gave up and took the 20 and waited for the delivery guy for my food. He comes gives me the food and she asked for it I give it to her and she said I had to pay for it. I told her why would she agree to comp the food and the refund is she was going to charge me. She was sooo rude and I understand the language barrier can cause miscommunication but why renege on the agreement. I didn't know what to do. At this point it's a screaming match and starts to complain to the guys in the back about it in her native tongue and ignores me. After some shouting I left with missing money and no food. This place is awful. The guests that came while this happened if you were not appalled and continue to support this place, please don't be surprised in being​ mistreated and lied to. Good luck to those that buy from this place."
1884,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"they are right around the corner from me, and delivery guy is always courteous.  It's a small takeout place that serves mexican and chinese.  The food is always great, I have no complaints.  I order the nacho platter with guacamole on the regular.  I don't order in person because I'll be standing there for too long, but I pick up the food or have them deliver."
1885,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,Very Well!! One of the few Chinese / Mexican food joints in NY that are really good!! The Mexican food however is superb!!!
1886,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. While waiting for the bus this morning, saw a rat in the window. Filed a complaint with 311. Disgusting- place needs to be shut down - yet again!"
1887,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"I would give it 0 stars if I could. While waiting for the bus this morning, saw a rat in the window. Filed a complaint with 311. Disgusting- place needs to be shut down - yet again!"
1888,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"Decent food for the price. I preferred the mexican food to the chinese, but their dumplings are great. Staff can be harsh sounding on the phone but are very nice in person."
1889,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"I love these Chinese tex mex places...cheap and delicious food. Their steak and chicken is charcoal grilled, quesadillas or fajitas is awesome! And u get some great American Chinese fried rice and dumplings to go with that soo good!"
1890,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"I have to admit: this is the first time I have ever encountered a restaurant that  simultaneously peddles Chinese and Mexican cuisines, a place I can call and juxtapose orders for wonton soup and a taco. It sounds weird. It sounds like a place that tries to do too much will not do anything well. But, surprisingly, that's not the case here -- both the Mexican and Chinese dishes here are very good.We tried a few items from both sides of the menu - tacos, ""Happy Family"" chinese food, etc. All were very good. In fact, the soft black bean taco was one of the best tacos I have ever had. And, it was only like $1.30. Fresco Tortillas solves the problem of not being able to agree on which type of cuisine to order. If you can't decide between Chinese food and Mexican food, get both! Prices are reasonable; delivery is quick. Recommended."
1891,J-BIEn9sMfgkMmrp9EzRxg,"Okay, food is good, but the delivery guy was incredibly rude. We don't want to pay for bad customer service. Also food is tad pricey for a tex mex restaurant"
1892,r_5PdGm0TwHJmyeoPguE8A,"I'm thoroughly impressed with this place. I've sampled many Caribbean restaurants here in the Bronx and as far as raw quality, this place takes the cake. I happened to be in the mood for a patty and spotted a Golden Krust as I was driving. As I approached, in the corner of my eye twinkled a humble yet quaint restaurant. I ditched the commercial Caribbean food idea and headed across the street... One of the best decisions of my life. I'm a sucked for brown stew chicken and this place has the right recipe: simply cook it like you're back home. The staff was friendly and and we shared a couple laughs. Everything is made from scratch and the prices are reasonable. The only drawbacks are I believe it's cash only, the cocoa bread I had with my patty wasn't made fresh and could've been thrown in the oven to heat up a little bit. Other than that, this place is amazing and I highly recommend it."
1893,r_5PdGm0TwHJmyeoPguE8A,"I went to this spot a year ago because I really wanted some West Indian food.  I wasn't expecting anything special and my expectations were pretty low because I am picky.  To my surprise, the oxtails were very good.  I also enjoyed the beef patty.  My friend ordered the pepper shrimp, and it was delicious.  The rice and peas were also good along with the plantains.  Oh and the curry goat was quite tasty!!The hospitality was flat. I wouldn't say the cook/cashier was rude but she wasn't warm and fuzzy, but if she keeps cooking oxtails like this she can continue to have her dry affect.  Some people require a certain decor, a personable host/hostess or a perky Paula to take their orders and this just isn't a prerequisite for me.  I require a clean kitchen, sanitary surroundings and for the food to just taste good.  I have experienced plenty of nice exchanges at restaurants with underwhelming food.  So, I say all of this to say, there are no frills at this restaurant but the food is GOOD. Stop by and order some oxtails with peas and rice."
1894,r_5PdGm0TwHJmyeoPguE8A,"Horrible service went there for fish and after 10 minutes I was told that they didn't have it , the petite mature woman who works there treats customers like if they are stupid, and a guy next to me who made a mistake On his order was ridiculed.... IT IS A SHAME THAT PEOPLE ARE HAVING A BUSINESS WITH A HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE..... PEOPLE BE AWARE OF THIS. I WILL NEVER GO BACK THERE IN MY LIFE."
1895,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"THE BEST CHINESE FRIED CHICKEN WINGS !i know that's a pretty bold claim but in all my orderings of chicken wings all through out NYC and even in the state of FL, no other Chinese restaurant has even come close. Whenever i am in the area, i HAVE to stop by and take home an order to go. Some times even two ! Make sure to ask them if they can separate the wings from the rice so that the wings stay crispy and don't get soggy from the rice."
1896,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,I was in the area and the people I was with wanted Chinese. We came in and ate the food was good and the people were nice. They gave us extra wings. I would come back.
1897,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,One of the top Chinese food restaurants. Fresh tasting food every time. No mystery meat. Great quality. You guys must try the chicken chunks. Yummy. Way cheaper version than getting it from a Spanish restaurant. They are also prompt with delivery.
1898,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Another typical Chinese American restaurant. Good food, never had any problems with quality. Few seats but most people do not dine in so there's often room to sit."
1899,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,Prompt delivery service! The pork fried rice and wings were good. I asked for only mustard and they gave me plenty. The fried dumplings and wontons were just ok. I would order from them again.
1900,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Boe Lee wins the Pelham Parkway Chinese Food competition hands down, as far as I'm concerned. Absolutely some of the best Chinese food I've ever had anywhere, nevermind just The Bronx. Quality is perfect--always yummers, always fresh, always the perfect amount of flavorful sauce (I can't stand other places that have bland and watered-down sauces). The portions are super generous and always full of the best stuff, while at other restaurants one often feels cheated by crummy content. Not at Boe Lee. My favorite order, a large order of tofu or meat/mixed vegetables/garlic sauce, can serve three people--stuffed full of perfectly cooked  tofu or meat, the best vegetables (the ones you actually want to eat and won't just pick out to toss away), and the richest, thickest sauce ever. I order a bunch of stuff for about $25, and they always send over 2 free cans of soda, now isn't that sweet? And they're always friendly! Some other places make you feel like they're doing you a favor by taking your business. Boe Lee's staff are fantastic, always a pleasure to talk to and to greet at the door. Bottom line: I wouldn't order from any other place in the area. 5 stars."
1901,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"There are a few Chinese spots in the area, and this one consistently has good food.  Once in a while, I feel their fried rice can be a little more flavorful but they have quick delivery and friendly phone service. My usual is chicken with broccoli and mushrooms in garlic sauce with brown rice. Always on point!"
1902,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"This used to be our go-to spot for Chinese food in the neighborhood (the one down the block never gets your order right and always forgets basics such as utensils), HOWEVER they just changed management and staff.  No one who was there 1-2 months ago is there now... this is evident in the fact that you need to 1. repeat yourself  since they can't ever seem to understand what you want (when it's not that complicated) 2. There is HAIR in your food.... TWICE.  We ordered food to go and when we got home we realized that there were two long hairs in the food. We immediately called them to complain and they sent us a second order which also had food in it!!!!! We were so upset that we had to take it to them and show them. Never again! I wish the old management/staff were still running the place."
1903,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Boe Lee is one of my clients. They don't know me directly. So I am sure they got great finger food. Such as shrimp rings, cheese sticks, chicken nuggets, apple sticks, fish sticks, and all shrimp related meals. Probably more. I am basically on Yelp trying to create an excel spreadsheet."
1904,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"This place is ridiculous. I was ordering from a hospital, which is a big landmark in the neighborhood. It is less then half a mile away from the restaurant and 15 minutes after I ordered they called to tell me I was outside of their delivery zone. I guess you can only order from them if you are, at most, a block away. Absolutely ridiculous"
1905,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Be aware it is cash only. The food is definitely more American Chinese than traditional, but the dumplings are good, the wontons are tops and the service was fast and friendly. Decent prices and pretty standard food, if you're expectations aren't through the roof then you won't be disappointed."
1906,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"There is fierce competition for your business on Lydig Ave. Boe Lee is THE BEST Chinese take out in the area.Clean taste is the best way to describe their food. You can distinguish crunchy green onion in the delicate lobster sauce. Or the hot chilies ad the beef if you get hot & spicy beef. Well cooked rice that's not greasy, and for those who have a taste for something diifferent, Boe Lee has a limited Thai food menu. I have had every entree on it, and each is well interperted. Best of all the service is good, delivery is promt. And prices are reasonalble in realtion to portions. Which are good. Not all take out is the same, definitley give Boe Lee a chance."
1907,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,They always take forever to deliver my food & they always get my order wrong.i don't know what's going on with them but they have to start stepping they're game up again.
1908,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Let's be real, this place is like 1/2 a block from my place. So, I ordered from them for 3 years out of convenience like average 4-7 times a month. Also, I have a crap diet. With that said, their food is your average fattening, good Americanized Chinese food in the Bronx. I felt compelled to write a review today because of the treatment I got on the phone. Ordered chicken fried rice, fries, & tostones like gazillion times 'til now without a problem, but this young dude tonight did not understand a word I was saying and hung up on me. I was like ""waaaaaa"" so I huffed my 1/2 block for a little rectification, and all I got was rolled eyes and glazed over looks from the manager. So, I marched my unhealthy diet across the street to Peking Kitchen. Same food (actually, a little better if that's possible), nicer customer service. And, if they fail, I'll march 1/2 block more. Then, 1/2 block more...then 1/2 block more....I should really learn to cook."
1909,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Let's be honest.  It's Chinese takeout, and very little about the menu distinguishes it from other places.  What sets Boe Lee apart is the fact that it's very good and not overly greasy.  I've been ordering from them for about 4 years now, and the prices are good and the service is excellent.  The delivery driver even knows who I am well enough to recognize when I moved from one apartment to another.The Sesame Chicken is awesome, and so is the Sweet and Sour chicken.  I like the Chicken with Cashews, also, and their garlic sauce is a nice salty spicy topper.  Whatever you do, don't miss the fried wontons.  They're out of this world, and possibly the best thing on the menu.  They're crunchy, filled with pork, and covered in what (I'm guessing) is a sesame peanut sauce.Definitely a go-to for the times when you have a case of the munchies and of all the Chinese takeout joints in my neighborhood (and trust me, there are a ton of them), this is the one I order from after trying all the others."
1910,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Read the reviews here and the wife and I were excited to try something a little better than standard chinese take out. Had the chicken with broccoli and hot and sour soup. Nothing to see here. Don't get me wrong it was perfectly fine, but no different than the chinese take out in your neighborhood. Maybe slightly less greasy."
1911,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"The food is good. I've ordered from there at lest 100 times or more. I've been in the area for a few years now. I can't say it's that much better than every other place, I guess I just liked a dish or two so I stayed loyal. I don't order as much as I'd like cause one of the delivery guys is pretty rude if he gets a tip less than $2.00. Call me cheap but at the rate I used to order that was too much. He would even put his foot in the doorway after getting a tip to argue about getting more money. No appreciation for me as customer, and mind you I always tipped, just not always $2.00."
1912,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,chiken and brocolii is very good and the egg roll
1913,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"My favorite takeout in the area, I have them on speed dial.  Not a fan of the boneless spare ribs, kinda dry, same for the fried chicken wings.  But whatever Chinese is Chinese."
1914,UVQrrOqHEjlYLrh5D9t1ZA,"Chicken and Broccoli is absolutely f-in amazing.  The chicken is fresh, the broccoli is cooked in a great sauce.  get it with white rice, and you got yourself a great meal. there's a lot of chinese spots in the area, this one definately adds a little bit more flavor and love to their dishes."
1915,psgUE5ZyjZ-X_06Vwkf-kw,Simple neighborhood deli offering some old school Italian specialities and groceries. It's a good place to pop in for a sandwich when in the area or at the park down the block!
1916,psgUE5ZyjZ-X_06Vwkf-kw,"Gotta say, little place, reasonably priced, home cooking, make nice soups, Pasta Fagoli, Chicken cutlets, fresh every day, full line Boars head cold cuts, and usual necessities milk juice, etc, nice people, open 7 days"
1917,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I been to this restaurant twice and the food is delicious. Both times I went was for Sunday brunch. The music is loud and they have a DJ. Staff is attentive and friendly. The drinks included in brunch were better my first visit compare to the most recent one. They offer Sunday brunch drinks for 4 hours, so they probably had to water down the drinks lol. Only disappointment is getting in contact with someone to reserve table. I called and emailed and never got a response, until my friend went in person to speak to someone. You can also dance where you find a spot."
1918,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I gave Raices two stars because the music was good other then that everything was horrible. If your looking for great food this is not the place for you. The food looked cheap and tasted horrible. I tried all my friends food just to see if it was just my burger but no it was everything. We have our food back didn't even waste our time taking another bite.   The Sangria was okay but it made my sister, husband and I sick."
1919,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Great placs to enjoy a drink , loud music & hookah .... Go eat somewhere else ... this is not restaurant but rather a club that happens to sell food. Dont valet either just find your own parking. If you understand these things... you will enjoy.   It is interesting that alot of the "" Five Star"" reviews on here are from people who only have reviewed 1 place on Yelp... hmmmmm interesting lol"
1920,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"TERRIBLE PLACE ! this spot is short staffed with employees that have a short attention span, Came here for some drinks & food and i kid you not i was waiting to get seated for more than 20 minutes. After waiting for about 15 minutes i told one of the girls if they can seat me & take my order and her attitude was insane even after my friend complimented her and was being nice towards her never coming here again and if you want to spend you're money on a sh*tty place then this spot is for you !"
1921,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,This place used to be good when they had their $1 mojito mondays my friends and i came here religiously but now it's overpriced for the most simplest meals. i had a chicken sandwich with fries & 4 small mojitos and my friend had a cheeseburger with fries & 4 mojitos as-well our bill came up to 80$ & The attention we was given by the staff is terrible. As a waiter you're supposed to come around every now and then to check up on things but the waitress was super busy on her phone by the bar i had to put my hand up for long periods to get her attention which was very annoying. I wish this place can go back to how they were with their prices and upgrade their staff cause im very dissatisfied & disappointed i used to love this place now im obsessed with Guadalupe up the block cause of their happy hour price all night & their food i can enjoy myself on a monday after work and not worry about blowing a huge amount of money on a weekday.
1922,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I'll start off by saying the music was great and. The sangria was good. But the food was by far the worst I've had in my life. The Tres Leche tasted like sweet sand. The  Bbq chicken wings were a tad salty and barely had any meat on them. I could've gotten a better burger from Checkers or Jimbo's. The Cuban sandwich was as dry as the Tres Leche no real flavor profile and it wasn't pressed. I had the runs after eating at this place Piss Poor.
1923,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Went here for my friends birthday brunch. The service was awesome! We had a large party but the staff made sure we had everything we needed. The food was excellent and I'm so happy we all had a great time.
1924,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Terrible service, ""Waiters"" are more interested in smoking hooka than waiting the table. The music is so loud that the waiters which are clearly ESL can't hear you. So they got my order wrong 3 times despite me pointing at the thing I wanted on the menu. Food takes a good 40 minutes to come out the kitchen so don't come hungry. The meal was good but it's really not worth the trouble. Save yourself frustration and eat somewhere else."
1925,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Came here on a Tuesday night with family and friends for happy hour and the manager was very rude! We sat down at 6:30pm and order wings only and it did not come out until 7:30pm. There was a language barrier with our waitress so she wasn't much help as well. Drinks came out wrong and when tryin to speak with the manager he simply gave us the hand literally! Didn't even acknowledge our presence and kept it moving. I will never come to this establishment ever again and I recommend you don't as well! Very Racist manager! Just run pass this place!
1926,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Had a great experience here! The bar was very boujee on the inside with great lighting. The music was also amazing, many great Latino hits. The club owner even made sure to removed anyone front he bar who was bothering my group. Would come again!"
1927,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Last minute date night leads me browsing through Yelp to find a nice spot. Raices happen to be top five place to go for my location so I decided to give it a try. 10 minutes away from house which is a plus since I had one goal: to get drunk! As soon as we arrived it was pretty empty which is a plus since we got seated quickly. Yessica was our host/ server and she did a fantastic job doing so. There was this one drink ""Malibu Rum"" that I requested and to my disappointments they didn't have it. Yessica did happen to suggest a drink that had a similar taste and I trusted her. The drink came out and it was pretty ; perfect for pictures. Honestly, it was a pretty good drink but couldn't been stronger. One thing that took me off surprise was Yessica asked me how was my drink and i told her her it was ""suave"". She took my drink, pour more liquor and asked me ""is it better?"" I said Yass, thank you! We ordered calamari which was super good along with the main course for two. The only downfall is they were pretty slow in their service despite it being empty. Eventually the food came and my drink already kicked in. I was happy with their service, I will be coming back!"
1928,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This restaurant is good for getting you liquored up and having you all set with hookah, but when it comes to the food, forget it. Me and a coworker went out with a group of other coworkers and we've placed an order for food a good hour and a half after our arrival time; and that was because they didn't tend to us right away. It took several times to speak to them about our orders. Never again! This place sucks!"
1929,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,WARNING - Do not use the Valet Parking!!  We paid $20 for the Valet service at this restaurant only to walk out to our car double parked with a pretty ORANGE ticket on the windshield.  There were about 6 cars with tickets.  When everyone confronted the manager of the restaurant he took all of our tickets and apologized and said they would be paid.  4 weeks later..... Ticket still not paid!! Call every week to try and speak to the manager and never available or don't get a call back.  Horrible way of doing business.
1930,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"If I could give this place a -10 I would!! This place is terrible from the parking (valet) to the table service! I went here with my husband and two other couples for some food after a concert. We arrived and left our cars with the ""valet"" guys. As soon as we walked in my friend was approached by the ""coat check"" (not a legit coat check just a table and a rack behind the table) girl who told my friend it was mandatory to check her coat, my friend very kindly declined stating she was cold and preferred to keep her coat, the girl argued with her and was charging her $10 to keep her coat!!!! After some back and forth the security guy jumped in and allowed my friend to keep her coat free of charge (my friend literally kept her coat on the whole time). We then proceeded to the table all the way in the back and began to order  a few items on the menu however the waitress had no idea what we were ordering and stated that the restaurant didn't have the type of cocktail we wanted yet it was a signature cocktail on the menu; needless to say she was completely lost. After an average meal and bad table service, we still wanted to stick around for a few drinks since we wanted to hangout a little longer but then the rude manager basically came and kicked us out of the table stating that tables were only for bottle service. To try and make it better he offers us a cheap kind of aguardiente (Colombian shot) which was hot and tasted like shit. And (drum roll please) we walked out of this shithole only to find our cars parked in middle of the street (busy street) with orange tickets on the windshield. The ""valet guy"" stated that the police came and gave everyone a ticket yet we asked why if we paid $20 valet parking!!!! He had no words and so we walked back into this shithole to speak to the manager who then came outside to ""reprimand"" his valet guy for not watching the cars. There were at least 8 cars with tickets! The manager nonchalantly apologized and took the tickets and said he'll take care of it yet he wouldn't give us our money back. I feel like this valet parking is a scam!!!! Of course this so called manager never paid for the ticket  and after many tireless attempts to reach him my husband and friends had to pay for their tickets. DO NOT GO HERE! Everything about this place is horrible!!!!!!!"
1931,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Great place for happy hour and brunch. This is my 3rd  time going to Raices and I must emphasize how great the food is. I had the stuffed chicken breast with sweet plantains and cheese. It was Amazing!!!!!!!!!!! The food taste fresh and the presentation is phenomenal. The service is good and the atmosphere and music is good. The had a live singer great addition to great food
1932,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Great place for happy hour and brunch. This is my second time going to Raices and I must emphasize how great the food is. The food taste fresh and the presentation is phenomenal. The service is good and the atmosphere and music is good.
1933,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"The staff here are awesome. The truly know how to make you feel welcome. The ambience, the food and the drinks are on point! I celebrated my GF's 25 birthday here. When we arrived they had the table already set with balloons and they were all very nice and accommodating for our party and allowed us to bring in our own cake without and extra charge. They even allowed us to hook up our Bluetooth and play our own music. Where do they do that at? Given the fact that we were pretty much the only ones in the restaurant at the time we felt like we had a private party. I do want to note that the service can be a bit slow in terms of bringing food and drinks. But once they arrive you'll be glad you had the patience to wait. I can't wait for my next visit."
1934,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,So disappointing. :( Came here to celebrate a birthday. Terrible service. The owner/manager  is certainly racist and ignored us the whole night after we made numerous attempts to reach out to him. The waitress did her best but the owner/manager made it so clear he didn't want black people at the establishment that we waited well over an hour for service at a empty restaurant. Let's work harder to not give businesses to places like this that discriminate because of how you look
1935,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"If I can give no stars I would. If you are not Spanish, trust me you will not be serviced. Waited an hour for food and drinks, when it was empty, waitress didnt speak English, and the manager simply acted as though we did not belong there. So we took our BLACK money elsewhere. I have never experienced this at an establishment. Will never come again, or promote this classless place."
1936,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,The services is very slow! The prices are good the food was great! Parking is awful! Always been like that for that area! Have WiFi but you have to get the password from the waitress once she decide to come to you! Only one bathroom for men and women and there was a line! Everyone smokes hookah there if this not for you don't go there!
1937,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,This place is epic at night i had. Blass great music and food. They offer parking . Great place for birthdays .
1938,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I like coming to this place because I feel I can be myself. The bartenders are nice they talk to you treat you nice. Along with their great service they serve me amazing food followed by even more amazing drinks. I truly recommend people come here.
1939,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Had a really pleasant time with my husband and friends for Easter. The place was not crowded and the staff although was not on point being back and forth, were attentive when required. Ps! They could of use some more training on waiting tables or get more waiters/staff since I only spotted 3 at that time. Brunch buffet was good. My favorite part was the battered Cod it was delicious! Sorry I must point that out.  We started with  a fruit and salad station , then an omelet station that no one was there to make smh!  Anyways, moving on to the buffet they had mangu-w-cheese, longaniza and salami(dominican traditional dish mainly served at breakfast)I didn't try the mangu cause I can make that at home. The seafood paella looked great and ppl at  my table said it was good. Then you move to rice and beans followed by Cod, stuffed chicken breast in some kind of bechamel sauce, bacalao(stew,salted cold fish. ""Caribbean dish"") and then pepper steak. The food taste was very good. I have no complaints when it comes to that, but I do have a few pointers:1) hire more waiters it will definitely make a difference ( you get better reviews when your staff is attentive.)2)eliminate the mangu and bacalao. It is not worth it substitute it with another option.3)fix the womans bathroom door pleaseee!4) I really enjoyed this place and believe that with a few changes it will grow."
1940,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Came here back when it was Caña y Cafe and it was awesome.  They recently changed the name to Raices and came for Happy Hour.  It was empty so we got seated quickly.  I'm a hookah smoker and part of the reason we came to Raices was because on Instagram they promoted free hookah until 8 however, when we got there, the waiter said they don't have hookah until after 8 so that made no sense to us.We ordered two drinks, a mojito and margarita which tasted great and had two appetizers of which neither I can recall what it was as they were pretty bland.  I dont see myself going back but it was kind of worth the try.  They shouldn't promote something that isn't true though hiwever, their happy hour prices are good."
1941,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Horrible service and food OMG I can not believe I spent my money and time to come here never again! They only play music they want to hear the hookah did not work! And she kept getting upset when we were spending our money! I must restate the food was horrible! The did not serve fresh food
1942,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I had such a pleasant time here!My cousin and I came here to meet with the rest of our family for Sunday brunch. I've heard about this place before, so I was very excited to check it out.The ambiance is very refreshing which made me feel comfortable right away. Our waitress was very attentive and she was a sweetheart. Their brunch food is buffet style and boy, were their options delicious. They had french toasts, mangu, pernil, potato salad, salmon and many more options, I just limited myself to these, haha. I got seconds and thirds...I just couldn't resist! They also had flan as a dessert which was a big plus. As far as their sangrias and mimosas go, they were pretty good and strong and definitely gave me a buzz.By the way, the pricing for brunch is about $30 on average, which isn't bad at all.I'll definitely come back here for brunch again. Thank you for the great service!"
1943,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Wish I could give a 5 star because I was really looking forward to visiting this place. Raises has a really good ambiance but the brunch wasn't what I expected. When I got there the hostess barely spoke English to understand any of the questions I was asking, which is bad for business. We were seated at the back of the restaurant and it took forever for them to bring us our Mimosas. The buffet style brunch was mediocre. There wasn't no good card describing what's in the pan. No one was at the omelette station meanwhile the condiments we left uncovered. Nothing was being replenished basically what you see is what you get. We had to ask several times for our plates to be removed from the table. FYI there isn't free valet parking."
1944,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,The best margaritas ever  and the food is delicious. The music is perfect. Great place for a date night
1945,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"The gist: this trendy Latin fusion spot offers up live music, delicious and authentic Latin food, and delicious drinks. The ambiance: While clearly intended to be a modern, almost club-esque approach to Latin food, the bright colored lights, fake greenery, and music that drowns out conversation were a little overwhelming on a Sunday. The food: Absolutely incredible, authentic Latin American cuisine. We started with drinks (of course) and ended up ordering a drink served out of a pineapple, which was really cool, passion fruit margaritas which were super tasty, and a traditions Peruvian drink. We then got the chicken nachos and ceviche as an appetizer. We were told the ceviche recipe was traditional from Peru, and it was really tasty, and the nachos were great as well. For our entrees we got the sea bass, enchiladas, chimichangas, and a traditional Colombian dish featuring steak, eggs, sausage, and plantains. Everything was exceptional, the sea bass in coconut sauce was some of the best fish I've ever had. We didn't have room for dessert but we'll definitely be back to see what they have to offer in the future!The service: Everyone was very nice and true to the Spanish feel of the neighborhood. Our waitress was bubbly and friendly and made a few good recommendations. No complaints here!"
1946,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I just called the restuarant and spoke to a manager ""Diany""& was just given an apology. Ehh that could of been handled better, possibly a refund on the tip or a comp meal. So my review stands and I won't be back. ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~**2 stars for the food and overall ambience. I was really disappointed with the service. It was horrible. So bad lol.We were seated quickly which was great. We had a table in the back which was also great. Then here's where it all started....We waited a little over 10mins for our server to come too the table. He came and never welcomed us or introduced himself. All he asked was ""you ready to order""?We placed our drink and entree orders and then we waited and waited and waited. We literally just sat there and waited, the server, Darley at no point came by to address us or inform us what the delay was about . 20mins later we began to receive our drinks at different times(by the way we were a party of 5). We had to ask him for a few things and he seemed bothered by us.  He would fly right by us or not be around at all when we needed things. It was annoying. Our food arrived 45mins after we placed the order. And my order was incorrect. I requested no veggies but substitute for a salad and veggies came out. The food was good, we all enjoyed our plates.Everything was hot and fresh. I ordered the passion fruit glazed salmon and it was a bit overdone but still good, I wished they would have add more of the glaze and I didn't request more and risk another 45mins to get it. The mash potatoes weren't good, tasted like boxed potatoes blah. My friend had the Trio enchilladas and she loved it. I tasted the green sauce on it and it was yummy. Another friend had the churrasco with yuca fries and I tasted that as well and it was delicious.For drinks we had the Tropical martini and strawberry colada and we enjoyed those too. Just not the 20min wait for them.*** The place was not crowded at all which is why we could not believe how long drinks and food came out, especially drinks!!!There was live music and it was nice, nothing spectacular but I enjoyed it and appreciated that it wasn't loud and obnoxious . The place is cute, just would suggest dimmer lights,  where we sat it was extremely high beam lights, weird.I would have given this place a solid 4 stars but the servers lack luster service, unprofessionalism and the ridiculous wait time brought it down to a 2.******* And I didn't appreciate gratuity being added to the bill when it wasn't earned!!!!!I don't believe I would return unfortunately."
1947,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Usually don't go for brunch buffets but I ended up here randomly. The options are pretty filling & heavy so I really can't (maybe) go beyond two servings. Mangu, salami, fried cheese, western egg scramble (no omelette station here), rice, chicken, pepper steak, paella, salads, etc. The sauce from the pepper steak was delicious and I didn't even bother with the chicken, it didn't look as good. I started off with a Dominican breakfast then pretended it was dinner time right after. Savage, I know. Now here is where they are lacking compared to the brunch buffets in the area. They have more dinner type options than lunch/breakfast and their spread is limited. For the same $29 I've seen other places with spreads that include fruits, muffins, French toast, mini bagels, sausages, bacon, and even an omelette station. They don't have any of this. They didn't even have onions on the mangu!That's a violation. These extra options would've allowed me to start with serving myself an American breakfast, a Dominican breakfast followed by dinner in one sitting. It's a buffet guys. I was a little bothered by the mimosas being served in plastic champagne flutes from party city. Maybe something happened? Also not the most cost friendly option if you're a family paying for kids. Initially was told the price for children is 20, she later apologized and told me it's 25. For a child who is barely having much food and obvs not drinking? In that case better off at a place with a regular menu. Other than that they were good with refills and polite. The place was a little loud but not unbearable."
1948,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I made a reservation through this app for Raíces for my family and I for Thanksgiving Day at 4pm on the Sunday prior. I received emails confirming and reminding me about the reservation. I get there yesterday Thanksgiving Day and the place is CLOSED. I was upset. It is very disappointing that Yelp and Raices are not working together to ensure smooth reservations that are actually put into effect. Because of this I refuse to use Yelp for reservations or go to this restaurant. Raíces, a tip check your reservations, for any future customers, through Yelp since you are using the service and CALL the locations to cancel if you will NOT be open. Thank you."
1949,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Ordered two chicken empanadas with my friend then was told they didn't have chicken so we chose the beef ones. Once they came out, we were excited to eat it and it was COLD in the middle!! It seemed like they just placed it in the microwave or oven and didn't let it cook all the way through. We weren't upset, we just let them know it wasn't hot enough and that while we wait for them to fix the issue, we were going to step outside for 3 minutes.Once we came back in, they gave us the empanadas and we were fine. We just waited for the rest of the food to arrive. Everyone became excited once our food started coming out, but guess what?! EVERYONE'S food was COLD! It wasn't even busy and it was only the 6 of us there plus only 3 other guests at a different table.We let them know everyone's food was cold and they took only HALF of our plates back, to bring them back 10 minutes later, the exact same temperature, except my chicken was burned more. NEVER AGAIN! The food looked great but it wasn't even warm."
1950,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,the food is really really good ! i came here for sunday brunch with friends and they had unlimited drinks. you get to choose a choice of app and entree. everything is great really enjoyed my time there. there's hookah on deck. you kno the vibess
1951,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I used to visit this place every other Friday after work, but I went the other day for a happy hour, it was cheap, but they don't have customer service, just a bunch of staff smoking hooka and the food and drinks were not the same.."
1952,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"They get a star for food and drink quality. Have been here on two separate occasions and both produced great food. I had a great churrasco and really good guacamole, the drinks are the right balance of strong and sweet. The service, however, is why the place is always empty. I've probably made one other negative review and felt the need to make this one. Both times, our server would forget aspects of an order. It's understandable in a busy place. But this location never has more than 4 open tables at a time. Even then, I'm pretty forgivable when it comes to small details. The second time, it seemed at as if it were the server's last day and she really couldn't give a rats ass. She was on her phone for most of my visit. She didn't return to my table unless I waved her down. And I had to flag her down a few times, unfortunately. She completely messed up my boyfriends order. And when we asked for something on the side, instead of just telling us that it cannot be done, she brought it out and then when we asked about it she said that this is how it's cooked and walked away. We were right next to the kitchen, so we saw when the food was finished, and would AGAIN have to wave her down after 10 minutes to pry away from her phone and bring us the food. After all this, we receive the check to find that a 15% gratuity has been added. I asked why this was, since it was just a table of two, and she said that once the bill is over $50 that the ""machine"" automatically adds it to the bill. This is not posted anywhere in the menu or restaurant. I asked to speak to the manager and she said no one was there.I really wish this place didn't breed a culture of IDGAF-ness. I really wish there was better management to watch for these types of oversight. This restaurant could really be great."
1953,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This is a Dominican brunch / bar spot that has a very good ambiance and fairly good food. The problems I experienced are pretty similar to the other recent complaints I'm reading here: the restaurant needs to be better managed in terms of professional conduct. When we reserved a table for a large group, we were promised over the phone that this business provided valet parking. This was an important feature since many of our guests were coming from New Jersey and would not be acclimated with the challenging street parking situation around Dyckman. When we got there, we were told ""sorry, we are not offering valet parking right now."" After repeatedly addressing the issue, we weren't given much of an explanation beyond that.Later, other smaller issues came up. The waiter explained that when getting the unlimited mimosas and sangrias, you can switch but only once. Everyone at the table questioned why switching was an issue and again, the waiter offered a weak explanation. This felt like splitting hairs to everyone at the table. The cost of $30 for unlimited drinks with a brunch buffet comprised of pretty cheap food (no shrimp, no skirt steak, etc) is a pretty high price to have silly rules like that imposed on you. Also, let it be known that I had about 7 sangrias back to back and I'm pretty sure I consumed less alcohol in total than I would in one generous glass of red wine. That's about it, other than the restaurant adding an extra person to the bill and having to address that issue. Again, great looking environment and if you're really a sucker for that maybe you will enjoy the experience but I was just too struck by the lack of professionalism."
1954,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This place as far as food drinks and ambiance are concerned its definitely worth 5 stars but unfortunately the service is terribly slow. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable. They're also willing to give suggestions and offer their opinion which I appreciate since I always have a hard time picking something when presented with too many good options. However, I would definitely suggest coming here on a day you have more than enough time to kill. When I came It was not excessively crowed and they had a live band performing. On my visit I had the salmon with passion fruit sauce. It's definitely an interesting, but delicious dish! Will be sure to visit again some time soon."
1955,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Celebrated my engagement at this restaurant. The staff were beyond friendly and welcoming. Called them at very last minute and they were able to accommodate a party of 16. The food was amazing and they serve large portions. Their plate presentations are very unique and neat. I had the cocoloso drink and I loved it! I wasn't really hungry and ordered a chicken quesadilla. No complaints about that. All of my friends' food looked great.Definitely coming back to try their other food and drinks!
1956,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Excellent! Delicious dinners with great presentation. Inwood, you need to try this place it deserves to be a lot busier. My gut gets around and this is a manhattan-quality restaurant on par w rosa mexicano."
1957,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,CLOSED! This place left me high and dry for Mother's Day with a party of 7 and it's closed! I understand thing happen but it's your responsibility as a business to alert all social media that you are no longer in business! I made reservations via yelp just 2days ago and the neighbors say they've been closed for a month! I'm disappointed as I use to come here often. Even if they were to open again I was left with a bad taste specially on such a special occasion such as Mother's Day.
1958,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I give this place two stars for the decor and the service the waiters were nice and attentive but what we didn't like was that he didn't want us to sit away from the aisle tables he insisted that we sit in the aisle seats. So we had to endure rude patrons from the other table taking selfies like crazy right by our table.    My fiance and I thought we try this place out before my 50th birthday celebration in October as trial run glad we did. So we went for our 8th anniversary celebration on 08/17/2017. We decided to try the brunch. The food was not what we expected. It felt like they served up left overs from the day before. There was not many breakfast items to have mostly dinner type food.The omelet station was not up and running the chef seemed like he didn't want to make the omelets he seemed bothered and didn't want to come out. The mimosas were not very good n they were warm my fiance soda was not very good either it tasted like pure sugar.        This place is definitely not for children it is not worth bringing your child there and paying 30 dollars for them to eat brunch. The brunch was not worth 29.99 I would definitely not eat here again not worth it. So I'll be canceling my reservation for my birthday....
1959,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Food was amazing. Ordered the chicken arepas as an appetizer, the habanero and mofongo with mashed malanga.. The flavors and presentation were mind blowing.Drinks: the rompe cama was great the coco cosmo was not good at all.Too full for dessert but looking forward to it next time."
1960,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,We made an online reservation for today Saturday (5/12) for 1pm ! We paid for a taxi all the way here and found out that the place was CLOSED!!! Smh why take online reservations when you're closed? Waste of time!
1961,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"OMG I cannot believe how delicious my lunch was. It was better than my grandma's cooking and that seriously says something. You have to come here !!!!I saw the lunch special offering bistec encebollado (onion steak) with a side for $8.95... How could I pass that up?! I got a side of rice and beans, and an extra side order of sweet plantains and holy grail of plantains these were some of the best maduros i ever had!!! Super soft and sweet, not those dried up starchy ones. The lunch portion was huge! Not what i was expecting for a lunch serving, and the side order of plantains was also huge. Currently writing this after cleaning each plate... I'm stuffed I really couldn't leave anything behind it was so good.I also ordered a passion fruit juice and it's the real deal with the little black seeds and everything so pungent and sweet and not watered down at all even with alot of ice. Ahhh the whole meal was seriously so good and I have high standards for dominican food.The music is really vibing and loungey and the overall space and decor is modern tropical and very pleasing to the eyes. They have outlets to charge your phones which is a nice touch! Currently charging my phone hehe.The service was very attentive, sweet and extremely pleasing!!! -in short, COME HERE !!! Try the steak onion dish and def get the sweet plantains and passion fruit juice. You wont be disappointed!"
1962,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"So I just ordered from here via Seamless/Grubhub... after not receiving my order at said time I called them. They told me that my order would be on its way as soon as possible. 1 hour later , I still had not received my food. I contacted Seamless 3 times and even they called the restaurant to see what was going on. Almost 3 hours later I received my order: COLD, SOGGY, and BURNT. I live a block away from the restaurant. Unacceptable and I will not be ordering from here again."
1963,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I will definitely be coming back here for many reasons. Noel the waiter made this place a great experience, the staff was great but he was exceptional. The place is a great place to go and have a delicious meal and relax. If your looking for a nice spot to just have a chill night, this is it. The food was yummy! We had the pinchos appetizer, seafood parillada for 2. The drinks were also very good and not water down. I had the white sangria,Which i must add was pretty strong. The decor is very chill and cute. I highly recommend you give this place a chance."
1964,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I made reservations and it was confirmed by text but when I showed up the restaurant was closed.
1965,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I had a wonderful time with friends for brunch which was delish. Will definitely come again. Our waiter Hermes and Ralphy was fantastic. Thank you all for your great food and service.
1966,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Happy hours is from 12-7. If you go before 4 p.m you should be able to get a parking spot. The drinks are 4.95. And boy oh boy are they lit. The Cosmo coco Loso is one of my favorites . I went on a Tuesday and ordered chicken cord eon blue for 5.95 and it was the bomb. I also ordered churrasco and rice and beans to go. All I can say is there steak game is the bomb . Food is flavorful. I definitely look forward to enjoying another brunch here with my girls . This spot is a hidden gem. Only thing is there was one waiter I guess because it was early and moved kinda slow.
1967,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Wow !!!! From the moment you step into this place you feel the great vibe , so I knew it was going to be a great experience here . We were invited to a dinner party here (great choice ) As soon as we sat the waiter of our table came & welcomed us & ask if we wanted a drink . From the many selection of cocktails I choose the Mojito passion fruit which was really good . As per my dinner I had the calamari salad , it was on point. Not overly greasy since its fried & just the right amount of salad dressing . Now let's get to the part of the Karaoke talk about keeping your audience entertain ! Over all experience here was the first word in my review ...... WOW ! See you guys again & keep up the GREAT work !"
1968,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I must say this place is totally different from dinner time to brunch.  I enjoyed having dinner here, the food, the ambiance, even the service. Now brunch horrible service let's start with asking the waitress what the kids menu was and her attitude was totally inappropriate, next glad we switch that real quick because waiter 2 was a bit better even though he only came to check in once. Mimosa disgusting, Sangria was very good, food is tasty, but the buffet needs a bigger variety. Also Management needs to realize that this a restaurant where families w children were running the show but they don't have child friendly cups or straws for children. I must say I will not be back for brunch!!!"
1969,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Went in for lunch with my son on a Wednesday afternoon and the it was virtually empty. We shared tacos as an app. For the meal I had the churrasco and he had sliders. The food was great but the service is slowwwwwww. It took forever for everything to come out. Not to mention I asked for the burger without cheese... When it came out it had cheese on it, had to send it back and wait an additional 10mins to make the correction."
1970,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Went on a Saturday night, the place was completely dead, unlike the restaurant just 1 block up. I had the El Bahareno (I think that is how its spelled), it was A-Mazing. Hubby was definitively loving it as well. Servers were attentive, and the restaurant was nice and clean. Was it mind blowing? No. Did it hit the spot? Yes! I would return."
1971,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"My family and I stopped by for their Sunday brunch and it was good.  We honestly expected a little more in their service level and food variety for brunch especially for the price.  Their Mimosas, Sangria and Morir Soñañdo were not what we expected. We are honestly not fans of lime in every beverage - even the water. Their Paella and Mangu was exceptional."
1972,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"A really nice spot. Celebrated a birthday here, nice atmosphere, friendly service, delicious food. The pulpo appetizer was fantastic! My only issue is that, while the live music was fun and we got down and danced, it was a bit too loud to have a conversation at the table."
1973,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I just ordered a Shrimp Ceaser Salad from this place, first of the delivery took approximately 1hr and a half to arrive at a location 2 blocks away. The lettuce in the salad was soggy and too much ceaser dressing, so much that it felt like a soupy salad. When the delivery guy arrived, he had an attitude and was dresses in kitchen attire. It appears as if he worked in the kitchen. Overall not satisfied and will not be ordering from there again?"
1974,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Love the food & atmosphere here. I've never had a bad meal. The food is fresh, delicious & reasonably priced. The service is outstanding. They have a great Sunday brunch buffet that is reasonably priced with unlimited Sangria & mimosas for about 2 hours. I like the venue is classy, professional & has good vibes.I really like the singers they have there they get the crowd involved & motivated.."
1975,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I've been there every week once or twice for the last 2 months and I've never had a bad meal. The food is fresh, delicious & reasonably priced.

1977,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I went here on a Thursday night with family and friends to celebrate my mother's birthday. The place is very nice and all the staff is very welcoming and friendly. Santos (I believe he is the manager), is very friendly, accommodating  and attentive. If you make reservations for a party they will ask if you'd like them to decorate the table with balloons (for $15, $25 and I forgot the other prices). They let you choose two colors for the ballons you want. The food was great we all loved it and their drinks are very good too. I loved the place, I'll definitely be going back. P.S. try the ""rompe cama"" (drink)"
1978,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I've been here two times for brunch. I have to say it's so good. The food is good. The unlimited mimosa and sangria is yummy. My glass was never empty. They always kept coming around to refill it. Once I finish with one plate of food I got up and served my self another plate. It's buffet style brunch. Only thing that needs work is the music. One of the times that I came for brunch my bf had to ask to change the music because it was a little depressing. It's a good place to eat and talk while having brunch. Oh and their are times when it's pretty empty for Brunch, but that's perfectly fine with me. Will keep coming back for their unlimited mimosa and sangria brunch. Did I mention that it's very inexpensive. Brunch is like $25-30 (can't remember which is it)"
1979,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Outstanding service happy hours drinks were great with out food coming out nice and quick. Great ambiance and setting restaurant is beautifully decorated. Our waiter was on point with food and drinks i will definitely visit this place again.
1980,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I am not sure where I start!5 stars for the nice ambience, for our server, I forgot his name  he is a young man from Dominican Republic , very friendly and very helpfull. The food, what was very tasty and fresh absolute not greasy.  We would like to come back for this! BUT...1 star we ( 2 adults and one child) did not see ( our mistake?) that the gratuity was included already and we gave a pretty good tip, separately ! Not okay at all!!!  We had to wait for the drinks to long, came after our Appetizer, was not the servants fault! No bartender, and when she came .....! After our server left and we had to pay,  after nobody checked on us if we want have another drink,  I had to go and ask for it!  Not friendly at all!  The new server,  chewing heavenly on a gum , no words, just put the drinks on the table and left! We asked for the bill, no words again just put the bill on the table and left , again a bill incl. the gratuity! Again, not okay at all! 0-1 for this action!"
1981,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I am so shocked that this place has 5 stars can we talk about how it took an hour and 30 mins for our food? And thats when we starting counting....... THE SERVICE IS TERRIBLE our food came out and then we had to wait another 20 mins for our other guest to get her food and it wasnt even PACKED I am really disappointed in the service because i was so excited to try this place out  ... ANDDDDDDDDDD it took another 30 mins to get our check lmao we were so ready to leaveThe food and drinks are good though ..
1982,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This lace has very good food. However, last week I went with my family and I had a horrible experience.  My food was extremely cold and I wasn't able to eat it. The waitress was very nice and apologetic but I still had to play for the plate and they didn't offer any replacement. The place also is starting to become a little ""guetto"" and people hang outside and smoke who is very uncomfortable for people who are eating. I'm def not coming back!"
1983,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I had a remarkable evening at Raices. The food was delectable. Guacamole a must and the most tender and tasty skirt steak ever. Additionally,  the service and attention was first class! I was pleasantly surprised  and greatly entertained with a live music ensemble playing great latin music and engaging the audience.  I will definitely be back!! Gracias! A must experince restaurant!!!!!!"
1984,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Last night my husband and I received phenomenal service at Raices. Diana greeted us, and immediately made us feel welcomed. Joshua was our waiter and was also amazing! Our drinks and food were great! We also got to enjoy some live music. Tony Bravo was singing and he was wonderful! Yesterday was our third time at Raices, and I have to say a good time there never fails. The only reason why I do not give them 5 stars is because the bathroom could be kept a bit cleaner. We will be back soon!"
1985,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I came here with about 15 coworkers ... the waiter appeared to be overwhelmed ..... the restaurant was empty .. orders were mixed up.... our first bill didn't have gratuity ... second bill they added gratuity... it was such a mess ...I asked to have only my bill separate from the group at the end the waiter literally argued with me about it... not cool at all !!!!!!!!!
1986,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Food is amazing, great decor and service. Only complaint is the crazy loud urban music (with heavy profanity and x-rated lyrics, not very family friendly). We sat towards the back to be able to talk but we had to talk very loudly to hear each other. If you like loud music, good food and nice rustic modern decor then this might be your spot."
1987,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,1st let me say the food here is really good. The most tender oxtails and pepper steak I've ever eaten. All the food was well seasoned I'd definitely come back really good. Only thing I'd change is the volume of the music during Sunday brunch too loud
1988,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Ok. So upon walking in we were very well greeted. The staff was great. The ambience about this place is perfect. Specially during dinner. It was nice and Mello. Drinks were good. But the only reason I give it four stars is because my salmon was sooo over cooked it was disappointing. That's what I get for asking for something that they aren't specialized for. But overall my husband enjoyed his bandeja paisa and his drinks.
1989,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,The food was great the only issue I had was the volume of music i couldn't talk or hear anyone of my friends. I wish they just notice pol where eating with there family and wanted to chat rather then feel they where in a club
1990,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Strong drinks. Perfect ambiance. Live music. Great salmon dish with passion fruit glaze. The mussels are splendid.
1991,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Food here is excellent. I recommend the Barahonero, delicious! On Friday nights they have live music, a little too loud if you're trying to chat but pretty cool. It's nice for birthday outings. The drinks are on point as well as the service. There was a time my waitress took her break to eat when we wanted to leave so we literally had to wait for her to finish to get our check but we were entertained by the live music. Would def. go backAt work sometimes I order for lunch and they are just as good and fast."
1992,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Amazing place!Me and my husband went for the first time to celebrate his birthday it was such an amazing night food and drinks  are delicious we had the asado argentino and its was great  the ambience is so refreshing the music  we loved it and margaritas are top. Definitely a place to  go, great food and great people"
1993,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Once again at this fabulous piece of paradise. Had the Lechon (Roster Pork) it literally melts in your mouth. Highly recommend it. Had happy hour drinks that were delicious. An excellent establishment. So come on down, up or fly, the point is get here you won't regret it."
1994,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"One of the best places to eat, and have either Lunch or Dinner. Maybe even a Sunday brunch. They treat you like royalty. I loved the atmosphere, Also the servers are so polite and pleasant to speak to.  I can't wait to go back again. Such great food."
1995,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I went to brunch this past Sunday. I think the price is fine. The food is standard. It doesn't taste great but doesn't taste horrible either. I ate ribs(the best tasting item for me) white rice, beans, carne de res.... the omelette was not cooked enough. What saved it was the sangria, it was strong and tasted great! Also I see on yelp there was a discount if you checked in. I asked the waiter he said no discounts on brunch. Well if that's what it is then it needs to be specific on yelp, because it does not specify"
1996,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,It was our first time in this place we had the choice to seat where ever we wanted (which i like more ) the service was excellent not to forget about the delicious food and the happy hour prices .. I would highly recommend this place We coming back here for sure
1997,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Decided to give this place a try on a whim to celebrate our wedding anniversary. The drinks, appetizer, meal, coffee and dessert we had were DELICIOUS!!  Parking can be hard, BUT they offer valet services which help out tremendously!  Definitely enjoyed the food and the staff was very nice."
1998,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"The food was absolutely delicious.  The vibe and music was very entertaining. The waiter, Luis, was very attentive along with the staff. This place was fun.  We came all the way from Long Island to celebrate a friend's birthday. I will definitely be back. Great food, good vibes, great service, great drinks!!"
1999,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"It is not often the atmosphere, service and food all measure up. Especially in a new restaurant, it usually takes a while to get up to speed. Not so at Raices, our first experience will bring us back ! Nice vibe from a friendly crowd as you enter,very inviting ! Waiter very helpful and great service. The food from the appys to our main course of skirt steak was great as was the mofungo ! Good quality ,generous portions at an affordable price. Drinks were generous, and a fun time was had by all ! I highly recommend trying Raices for dinner,you won't be disappointed ! Rich D."
2000,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Wow! A true Latin restaurant with genuine Latin flavor. The staff is very welcoming and the food is to die for! I usually come here on the weekends to have a nice cocktail and listen to good Latin music. I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good Dominican restaurant in the Inwood area.
2001,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Celebrated my mom's birthday here this afternoon. It was awesome! The service was incredible, staff was so on point. Our reservation was for 1:30pm and when we arrived there was one other party and the rest of the place of empty! That was a plus! Not sure how any one else feels about that but I appreciate things like that. The energy was positive and welcoming! The food was delicious and the setup was perfect. We were without a doubt satisfied. Free Valet parking which obviously was a plus. Recommending this place to any and everyone!"
2002,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Disgusting food!! This place is totally overrated!!! Nothing was fresh, won't go back for sure!!! Gross!"
2003,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Absolutely incredible!!! The service was outstanding, the food is delicious, the owners are generous and friendly, and the atmosphere is classic. Seriously, yelpers know that I call it like I taste it.  Oh, I should also mention the drinks are outstanding.   No really, do this!!!  IF YOU HAVE NOT YOU ARE MISSING OUT!!! Perfect for Latinos, Gringos, EVERYBODY!!!  Stop reading and go eat!!!ENJOY!!!"
2004,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"The food was very good, but the service was amazing!I was there with a group of 8 friends for lunch and the service was spectacular.  Lots of attention to detail: manager was attentive and checked on us frequently, waiter made sure we had everything we needed.Food: Everyone at my table really loved the food.  Portion size is spot on.I recommend the  Chicken Parmesan, the Steak and onions and the grilled vegetables.  The only thing that was a bit underwhelming was the mashed potatoes.i will definitely be visiting Raices again soon.  I recommend them for Brunch, Lunch and Dinner.Sangria was also very good."
2005,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Very accommodating of our large party; Sunday Brunch Buffett! Live music, unlimited mimosas and sangria for 2 hours. Great staff and food. Super fresh. Walked out with food itis"
2006,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I had a reservation for 25 people, they closed down and didn't have the decency to call me to let me know, I found out when my guess showed up to the place. They posted it on IG but not every customer follows a business online... totally disappointed...they have to be more profesional"
2007,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Love the food and the drinks very nice staff!! Delicious piñas coladas :) definitely go for it
2008,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This place is such a gem. Hidden on 207th street so you have to look for their sign. Organized a surprise birthday dinner for my cousin and the service was amazing. They made sure everything went so smoothly. The food was fantastic, all of the choices on the menu hit everyones chord. Also an example of their impeccable service, when one of the guests on our table didn't like their dinner choice the waiter gladly took it and did not charge her for it and checked if she liked her second dish. They made my cousin feel very special for her birthday! I highly recommend this place for a small event, they have reasonable packages and amazing service comes with it!!"
2009,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,very good food I found ... everything went to yes time ... a good service .. what I liked the most were the margaritas that I take from the truth I recommend it was a good experience little to improve but I would say that totalme you recommended
2010,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I went on a Sunday night (no work that Monday!). I was pleasantly surprised to see a live band playing bachata. I love live music, so this was a plus. They sat us on stools close to the door. I didn't love our seats - we were far from the action and a little isolated. The manager (very friendly and attentive) came over and asked us if we wanted to change seats. They sat us in the middle of everything. Yay! We ordered margaritas, appetizers and entrees. The menus represented different ""raices"", from the Colombian bandeja paisa, Mexican tacos, Peruvian ceviche, Dominican chimi, Puerto Rican lechon. I could go on, but you get the point. I recommend this place and I would definitely go back."
2011,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I heard great things about Raices.  Finally getting there was a memorable experience.  The food was rich and plentiful, the atmosphere was energetic and the service superb.  I highly recommend."
2012,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Raices well this is the old Caña y Cafe. The food is good, the drinks are  strong lol and their Brunch is amazing plenty of variety. Costumer services is good"
2013,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Went there for my sister and dads bday, it was really good. The buffet selection is not big but it was deff good. By the time me and my family got there, there was some things that had already ran out. I had a reservations at 2pm but did not make it until 240ish because of the traffic on the gwb. Besides that everything was good. I do think their lemonades are deff over priced, $17 for two lemonades, with 0 alcohol, the cups weren't even big so that was surprising.They also have free valet parking on the weekends."
2014,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Food was delicious and the sangria was superb! The staff were very attentive and nice. And they were not pricey. I would definitely return. :)
2015,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"So the food was on point! I loved it and the service at the bar was great however overall in going to say very poor customer service. I called a few days prior and asked if I needed reservations and the gentlemen told me they opened at 12 noon and to just come in-no reservation needed. When I get there with my brunch crew, they refuses to give us a seat and stated that the available seats were for reservations. I suggested that we sit there at least until the people came for their reservation but that didn't work out. I felt like we should've been accommodated due to their MISTAKE! In very big on customer service and that was extremely poor of them. I'm going to need them to do better! Lesson learned for me and now I know that I need to make reservations. Even though that experienced pissed me off the gentlemen making the omelet and pancakes was very polite."
2016,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Saludos, the best brunch in the hight is Raíces... not only their food is delicious but their variety is awesome. The staff make the place more reliable and welcoming. But the top cherry is their live artist while you eating. I been to mama Juana, mama sushi, papasitos... etc and they can't be compare to raíces. This is my home for every Sunday brunch. You won't regret the visit."
2017,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Came here yesterday for my daughter's birthday brunch. The restaurant itself is nice and our server was fine. The food was absolutely disgusting. Based on other reviews I was under the impression that there would be much more variety and breakfast food-home fries, pancakes, etc. there WAS an omelet station however everyone's order was wrong. Other than that, there were about 5 trays of luke-warm dinner food. For that I could've stayed home and cooked a much better meal myself."
2018,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Great Staff Lidia is the best. Good food and the price is perfect. Try this place you will leave full and happy.
2019,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Wow,  what a gem.  My friends and I have quickly become regulars on Friday night just because of Andre  Veloz, their live music is amazing.  Food is great too. I had the ceviche there last time I was there...very, very good. Excellent service,  I just had one issue last time I was there, they had no good white wine...but otherwise,  I am very pleased with this place."
2020,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I came in on a Friday. They have live Latin music. Prices are good and the quality of the place is worth every penny. Looking forward to come back in the future.
2021,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Great service and food. The cocktails are reasonably priced and I recommend the Faldita de Argentina.
2022,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,I was here last night. Amazing food and great service. I celebrated my mom's birthday here and they made sure it was special. I recommend this place to anyone and it's not very expensive. They serve lots of food and it's really good. Love this place.
2023,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"My family and I started of the New Year with dinner here, which was such a great experience with delicious food and cost effective. There was 5 couples we had several appetizers, an entree each and few cocktails and we paid $120 per couple( which I consider a bargain!) the food was delicious - the pinchos were yummy. My boyfriend had the churrasco and I had the barohoneros (which was my first time eating that). The white sangria is so good and the capirihña was also made just right. I think this is such a great place for a date, family or night with the friends.  Also the manager bought us a round of shots which Was thoughtful and our server was a doll. Definitely going back- maybe for brunch!"
2024,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"The food was good, the service was great and the ambience is great.... HAVE THE FISH TACOS!!!!"
2025,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"My fiancé and I came here last weekend Friday around 6pm.  We were testing it out for our potential wedding dinner site, The service was amazing, the restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and the food topped it all off. I had the chicken Parmesan with fettuccini pasta and my fiancé had the chicken breast stuffed with maduro (absolutely amazing btw) with black bean Moro. Amazing experience and we are planning to have our wedding here as well, the management Pablo is amazing and is accommodating to all our needs for the upcoming event! Highly recommended. ( p.s. As we were leaving a live band was setting up to play so great if your into dinner and live music)"
2026,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,The food here is truly exceptional! I wouldn't call it authentic Spanish food but it is nevertheless very delicious. It must be noted that the prices are expensive and the portions aren't particularly great. My boyfriend and I shared the Filet Mignon en salsa de bongos which is basically a tender steak of beef in mushroom sauce with a side of mashed potatoes and green vegetables. The steak had a great texture and flavor and the mushroom sauce added extra flavor. The mashed potatoes were very flavorful as well but the vegetables didn't have a particular flavor to it. The happy hour deal was worth it too in terms of price and drinks. There were plenty of options and I got the apple martini. It was definitely stronger than I had expected but tasted good. The service was great too and the waitress made sure we were taken care of at all times. The ambience was noteworthy too. The furniture was arranged nicely and lights were used to decorate the place. Overall this is a great restaurant and I would recommend it to anyone willing to spend a little extra for a night out.
2027,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I went to this restaurant for the first time on my birthday.It was welcoming.The décor, the background music and the friendly Manager made this restaurant feel welcoming.However, I feel like the waitress could have been  a bit more genuine.It almost felt as if she was forcing herself to be friendly.Not a comfortable vibe.The food was fresh and flavorful,but it didn't wow me.I wouldn't discourage people from trying out this place,but it's not on my list of recommendations."
2028,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"First off the restaurant is very beautiful and the staff are extremely kind and welcoming. The drinks are very good and our food was excellent. We cannot attest to meat dishes because no one in our party eats meat but we all had different dishes and we all loved our food. I cant wait to come back! My only complaint is that the guacamole tastes store bought; its not bad but its not great. It didnt taste fresh and id recommend using more bell peppers, cilantro, and lime. Im sure these things were in it already but i feel like it needed a little more love."
2029,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Sooo good! Excellent! Had my bday dinner here 8/27 every single thing we ate was outstanding. Plus, they treat you so nicely! I'm coming back for that shrimp mofongo!"
2030,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,Went there for happy hour on a Friday and it was good! Service was attentive and the drinks were strong and good but some are not and the shrimp quesadilla was really good... overall will definitely com here again and the price was great for an happy hour
2031,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Ordered nachos they were a soggy mess! Enchiladas were just ok, rice was bottom of the pot, old & dry! Cheese cake so small for $7,Not very happy!"
2032,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,The food is delicious and the portions are generous. The staff/service is also great. I've been here a few times and the only disappointment was a strawberry piña colada I ordered in one of my visits.
2033,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I could only say amazing things about this place , the food was great yet the service was wonderful, they went out of their way to make my friends feel at home including myself, good drinks, cake and music what more can a birthday girl ask for. A well deserved 5 star for me."
2034,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I came in for a quick lunch and I really liked this place. The empanadas were very fresh and crunchy. I got the bistec encebollado and for the price it was really good. I picked tostones as a side and it came with some steamed vegetables ( both pretty good). My boyfriend got the rompe cama drink and it was a little too strong ( which not many people would complaint about) but it was just a little hard to drink. I got the  red sangria and was really happy with it. We went around 2pm so it was pretty empty, but we really liked the vibe and the decorations. Also the happy hour special was amazing. Above liking the food, I also liked that their prices were fair, their staff was friendly, and the bathroom was really clean."
2035,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Very worth a trip to Inwood.  We went on a weekday night in time for happy hour.  Not many patrons.  I cannot figure out why.  Drink specials ok, large beers and wine servings.  Apps at happy hour AMAZING.  Fish tacos huge and tasty.  Arepas with beef stew also.  Another couple came in for wine/beer and apps.  I had the the flattened steak with onions, and a side of rice and beans and it came with a good portion of fresh steamed veggies.  Friend had the pork, pernil, also good with sweet plantains and mora (rice and beans mixed) and small salad.  Would come again and wish it were closer.  They have a lunch menu and brunch which I would like to try 12-4 on I guess weekends and they say music and mimosa or sangria.  Worth a trip or if you visit Inwood Park or Cloisters.  Music a bit loud.  TV showing the baseball game kept flickering and that drove me crazy."
2036,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This is officially my first review on a restaurant considering I go out to eat quite alot. I was originally hesitant going there since we were driving in from Nassau County. It was definitely worth the drive. The experience was phenomenal. From the attentive and accomodating wait staff to the AMAZING food. Everything we ordered was SO good. It wasn't as packed as I thought it would be (we had an 8:30 reservation) but when we left around 11:30 it started to get busy. The music was great because it was loud enough where you can still have a conversation and the place was dim enough so that if you're there with a date it feels romantic. And the best part is to you get amazing food at a reasonable price. So if you have any doubts in trying out this place, DON'T. You will not be disappointed."
2037,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"I actually really like this place. The food is flavorful and the life music is nice. We got free tequila shots which was nice. The singer came to speak to us and made us feel welcomed. I also sang a little on the mic. It took a long time to get the check. All in all, I recommend it."
2038,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"This is easily among the top and most underrated spots uptown NYC. Attentive waitstaff, amazing food, and reasonable valet service. The live music is extraordinary. Cousin celebrated her birthday here and she commented on how good the music was. We thought they'd brought some dj who was playing random salsa/merengue/bachata/new school joints but we were shocked when we turned to the little center stage and saw the dj was actually performing every imaginable Spanish genre. The Palestinian waitress is especially charming."
2039,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Place is nice, food is good. Service was trash. Group of ten and we barely saw our waitress and it wasn't even packed. Most of the time, the manager has served us himself, which I guess is worth something. Also, they serve Hookahs, but not until late night. We're here for happy hour drinks and no hookah in the heights.... no good."
2040,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Very nice decor, but not good customer service. I made a reservation through Yelp and upon arriving there wasn't a greeting of ""Good Evening, do you have a reservation""?  No, he just said table for four? Food was good. Ceviche was the best out of everything. Drinks are overpriced. I ordered mojitos and it was not worth $12. When I receive my bill the waiter added an automatic 20% tip. There were only four us and on their menu it stated an 18% tip will be applied for a party of 5 or more. When I brought it to his attention he said he made a mistake and it should be 18%. When I asked why am I being charged an 18% tip if it's just 4 of us? He really didn't have a reason behind it. When I mentioned I shouldn't have to be charged an 18% (the service wasn't worth it) he said it's because of the ""LIVE"" entertainment. If that was the case, it should've been brought to my attention from the beginning. If you decide to go to this restaurant make sure to review your check."
2041,8o-B_1q4XB48CmdaXdm2KQ,"Excellent new neighborhood addition.  Great food, outstanding prices and beautiful decor, atmosphere and service.  Delicious lunch menu, outstanding margarita for $4.95!!!  Stop looking around!!!  Keep the good work!!!"
2042,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"I'm new to the neighborhood and stumbled upon this pub. The food is delicious and the drinks are quite decent. Lots of specials and activities. The service was good and people friendly. It was trivia night when I came in for dinner and it was so much fun! I recommend this spot for friendly, relaxed environment with awesome food."
2043,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I came in one day to have dinner there they said they do not sell food there mind you this is a bar restaurant they looked at me and my husband we are Hispanic and they did not want to serve us I felt the racism it was really disgusting
2044,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I love the wings here. I have only been twice and they were on point both times. You get 12 meaty wings for $9. Next time I go I'll have a drink or two!
2045,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"I have fond memories of my visits to Jimmy Ryan's years ago! Having a party with girlfriends and ordering the ""Whole Shebang"" platter of appetizers was awesome! We revisited this neighborhood staple yesterday for lunch and was a little disappointed! First, when you walk in, it's dark, I mean really dark, the lighting and decor. We went to sit in a booth that was ""aged"".  To say this place needs a spruce up is an understatement! Even their awning outside is tattered and worn.  But we are here for the food! Now realize that we are in a Pub Restaurant, so my review recognizes it's not a fine dining establishment.  I loved that they had my harvest ale and they even rimmed it with honey and cinnamon without batting an eye lash, kudos to the bartender! We started with soups, a crock of French onion soup that had me nervous when I first saw the croutons atop instead of bread, but it worked, it was pretty darn good!  Now the Soup of the day was chicken vegetable, and even though it was full of fresh chicken and veggies, it had a peculiar taste to it, I believe coming from the peas and green beans in it. It also could have had some rice or pasta to make it better. Onto our entrees! Before I bite into this subject I just want to say our server ""Eleni"" was very sweet and appeasing and did the right thing at the end, more on that later. The hot open faced turkeySandwich was good with fresh roasted, thinly sliced turkey with a good gravy on the side. The home made mashed potatoes were delicious as well. Unfortunately, my entree was a disaster! I asked for steak quesadillas with the sour cream and salsa on the side. It arrived plated with a full onion slice and tomato slice on the side on a bed of lettuce (not quite sure what they were for. Garnish?)  Now I stated my concerns to our server of getting my steak medium and not over done but alas the steak was like fatty liver!  Then orangey salsa also was sub par, thin and bland. Eleni did the right thing though and took it off the check. The prices were reasonable, service good but ambiance and food needs improvement. I'll return in a couple of years and hope they considered my recommendations."
2046,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"I normally love this place, and I still do...it's just the delivery kinda sucks. The two times that I have had delivery it has been terrible. Seriously, as close as I live to this place I will just sit down and eat my food. I suggest you do the same if you are close by."
2047,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"A friend of mine took me here when I was visiting, because he remembered it being good. We were both disappointed. The mozzarella sticks were rubbery. The fries tasted like frozen stock. The burgers were basically patties of meatloaf. Not very tasty, the place was dark and in desperate need of upgrading, and our server had the personality of a doorknob. I wouldn't go back."
2048,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,where do i start with this place! the food is so nasty and dry! its not seasoned. got fries from them yesterday and they taste like they let the potatoes sit there til they go bad then want to use it grosssssssssssss negative stars
2049,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"My local spot for my drinks! i like how they have ,25 wing and 2 dollar coors light and bud light pints on Monday night football. They also have the same deal on Tuesday nights during the baseball season.  The main bartender is so nice, he often gives buybacks.  Their basic bar food is good, i never really had anything besides wings, apps, and burgers from there and i think they taste good.My only complaint is about one of the waitresses that works there. A month ago i was there and it wasn't crowded at the tables ( the bar are was full) and this waitress took forever to do everything, give us beers, and take our food order. Also as we were eating a few more friends joined us at the table and you would think the waitress would come over right away to see what they wanted, but NOPE, she didn't.  After a while we just went to the bar ordered our drinks and came back to the table with them. The bartender must have known we were frustrated because he gave us a round on him.It wasn't just me i was told by other people that this waitress is beyond slow.5 stars on the deals5 stars for the bartender ( i'll remember his name shortly )1 star for the waitress"
2050,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,This was my first time here and I'm notSure about returning. The place was sort ofPacked with only 2 servers. It took about 10-15mins to order drinks and food. The drinks took 20mins to come out and when our food came out after 30mins half of our order didn't come out at all. Most of our order was appetizers. Our second round took a shorter time. Even tho my first time was not great. I may return. Everyone needs a second chance.
2051,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Went in with wife and friend for a quick late dinner - and love this place.  Service is unbelievably good, and the drinks kept coming.  All 3 of us ordered a burger with fries, and they came out perfect and tons of fries that were hot.... Love it - will be back"
2052,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Meatloaf is tasty. The mash potatoes are buttery and so are the veggies. This is a cool dive bar with decent food.
2053,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"This delivery is based on the take out quality alone. I ordered the bacon cheese Burger, it's decent. I'd say this is the one place in under a mile of pelham bay that uses hand crafted patties instead of frozen ones. Cheese was a bit below decent and bacon was shriveled up (I like some juice in mine) it's just okay. I also ordered cheese fries, which frankly.. Any form of fried food you order is gonna be soggy no matter how close or far you are from that restaurant. They were cheddar cheese fries and again.. Just okay. If you're looking for a delicious meal to enjoy sober, this isn't the place. If your around late in the evening though.. This might hit the spot."
2054,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Well to start off, they only have one waitress for a whole dining room. Honestly, it's bad service but nothing against the waitress. It took over 15 minutes to get drinks, which wasn't cool. Also, the food was bland and gross. We all got burgers and asked for medium rare and gave us well done. The food was pretty disappointing.  Overall, I wouldn't come back. Even if I was drunk this food would STILL be gross."
2055,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I have ordered 3 times thru GrubHub and my orders have taken about 2 hours to arrive. When you call to check the status they tell you we got a little backed up. Food finally decides to arrive and is dry and cold. Will never order from this bar again. THE WORST!!!!
2056,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Mrs Pauls fish fillet for fish and chips for $15.00. Corned Beef that was Deli meat, not brisket and a Shepard's pie that was only ""okay"".  way over priced for fast food style food."
2057,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"the service here sucks. The waitresses seem confused and overwhelmed.  Putting an order takes forever and getting served takes even longer; last time I was there it took more than 40 minutes. Minus the bar area, the restaurant itself is poorly run.Having said that, I think its sad because the environment is great, the food is passable and it's a great neighborhood bar.  Poor management and staff seem poorly trained"
2058,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Best Bloody Mary in the Bronx. Great atmosphere and staff. Going into Jimmy  Ryans on a Sunday to see Joe, Katie and Louise is alway a guaranteed good time."
2059,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I dont understand why this place gets such bad reviews. For a diner in the Bronx it is fantastic. The food is much better than your average diner food. It is freshly cooked and taste delicious. Unlike most diners that sell frozen food or old food. During the summer you can eat outside which is great. I haven't eaten on the inside  yet but when I do I guess I'll update everyone when I do. I actually enjoy that it's an Irish diner because in addition to all the regular diner food you can get some pretty unique dishes that taste awesome. This is by far my favorite diner in the area. It's more expensive than the other diners in the area but that's because the food is actually good so it is definitely worth it. I give 4 instead of 5 because of course ambience and service could be better. However you cannot expect too much from Bronx places so whatever. Love this place!
2060,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"This is my favorite bar and, let's face it, you're not going there for the food. Irish food just sucks in general. I can say that, I'm Irish. This is the spot for when you're bored at midnight and want to relax in a semi-quiet bar with somewhat normal people who are all waiting to smirk at that one drunk idiot they don't really know. Plus, you can sit outside. I love to sit outside. There's never any drama. As for the guy who said ""he heard that people might be using drugs in the bathroom"" I have a response: 1) If you didn't see it, it didn't happen. 2) Every bar in the universe has people doing drugs in the bathroom. People do drugs in the bathroom at Starbucks. Why? Because junkies are junkies and they get high anywhere. It's not a seedy place at all."
2061,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"I definitely wouldn't call myself a regular here, but I've stopped in a few times over the past few years.  Kind of your standard run of the mill Irish pub in this part of the Bronx.  Nothing too special, but a decent place to throw back a few and watch a game.  While the bar is your standard pub, the food is here is slightly above average which makes it a great choice for some drinking when a little bar lunch/dinner is in order.  The burgers are the highlight for sure.  There aren't many good places to get a burger in this neighborhood, but this is one of them.  Plenty of seating and TVs everywhere, even if they are a little outdated and could use some upgrading.  **April Underdog Challenge Day 12**"
2062,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"This place was good a few years ago. The food is pretty good, the place is nice but its not the place that is the probelm its the people who go there. A few times I was there I have seen fights, underage people in there, heard some stories about the people doing drugs in the bathroom."
2063,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Nice local spot if you want to just go have a drink and a bite to eat close to home.  Live music certain nights fun crowd. Good clean place and friendly service.
2064,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Yeah... I really don't like this place, the owner is pretentious and beer prices are a little bit to high for it's location."
2065,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I'm not gonna waist my time writing a detailed review of this place. Terrible food. Bad service.
2066,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"One of my favorite bars in the Bronx.  On Friday nights they have the cutest bartending duo hands down in the neighborhood in Timmy and Joe.  They might seem like queers but they're not so don't bother trying.  The steak sandwich is the tits and sometimes a Mexican version of Kurt Russell from Tango & Cash walks in.  Also, there is a jukebox which has everything from Macklemore and Ke$ha to Gaston's theme song in Beauty and the Beast (dope track).  Come for the drinks, stay for the queers."
2067,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Ordered the fish & chips. Fish was slimy & smelled horrible.  The waitress never even asked me if I wanted an new meal until my husband had finished his burger. Will never go back & I live right across the street
2068,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"THIS is what a neighborhood bar should look like. These guys are doing it right. Good food, buybacks, friendly atmosphere, local newspaper clippings on the walls - A+ for atmosphere, service, and price."
2069,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"Jimmy Ryan's is the neighborhood bar my friends and I frequent.  The crowd is 60% young people and 40% middle aged folk.  The beer selection is very limited.  The drinks are cheap in comparison to Manhattan, but not that cheap in comparison to the rest of the Bronx.  The food is typical bar fare.  There is a Rockola jukebox (one of those ones where you can download songs from the Internet.)  On Saturday nights, there is a DJ and often times, lots of neighborhood youth.  At all other times, you will have an easy time finding a comfortable table to sit at and linger over a beer.EDIT:  They now have Blue Moon!"
2070,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Cheap beer and decent bar food. Nice Irish pub!
2071,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I went in looking for some great Pub food. I ordered the buffalo wings. They gave a big portion but they were still raw.. For dinner I ordered the open turkey sandwich the meat looked like it came out of one of those dollar packages you see in the super market.. bad food is not the word. This is a disgrace to all  Irish pubs and should be a bar only or shut down.
2072,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Cheap beer and the chicken tenders are sooo good! Only been there once so can't say I'm a fan yet.
2073,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,I only go to Jimmy Ryan's for one thing: Gaelic Burger - and that is very deserving of four stars!
2074,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Best burgers and food in the area.  Must order the Jimmy Ryan's burger and onion rings.
2075,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,Overpriced drinks. I have been to Jimmy Ryans a few times and I am not a fan at all. The drinks are overpriced and the decor of the place just doesnt justify the prices. The beer is cheap but if you want liquor you're gonna pay for it. The bar itself is super tiny and looks very old. The bathrooms here are abysmal. There is more room in my jewlery box than the bathroom at this place. If you must use the bathroom here I hope you're not shy because by the time you exit you will know the person next to you a little more intimately that you would like.
2076,EQxD4-euHR7SZFDH5qDlUA,"My son has a cub scout meeting in the area there every Thursday and so I find myself downing at least 4 absoluts on the rocks those nights.  I suspect since I've become something of a regular, I get a break on the drinks (but no promises).  Reminds me of Cheers - when I walk in, they all know my name, and I haven't even been going that long.  Folks are friendly and I go it alone and always end up in deep, semi-drunken conversation.  Can I just tell you that the buffalo wings are sooooo good!  And I don't say that lightly.  But you better like 'em hot.  No joke!"
2077,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,"I made a large order over the phone and went to pick it up about 25 minutes later. I ordered spicy tuna kimbap, donkatsu kimbap, and spam kimbap along with ddukbokki and kim mal ee. Everything was delicious and freshly made. I will definitely be coming back for more takeout and dine-in meals!!! Super happy to have an awesome Korean bunsik in Bayside!"
2078,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,"New bunsik place on Bell blvd! My family and I were thrilled to see this place open after one of our favorite bunsik restaurant closed several years ago. I finally got to check it out today and it did NOT disappoint. The interior is pretty spacious and very clean and service was great. There are many many options to choose from. We got the ramen+tteokboki, sunny kimbap & guksoo. The guksoo could be better, was a little bland. But the tteokboki and kimbap were AMAZING. 110% worth the price. This place is an amazingly cheap Korean eats and I see myself going here pretty often (this is coming from someone who just came back from living in Korea for a year) Definitely recommend!"
2079,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,"A new place for me to fix my Korean food cravings! Yum! I ordered sunny kimbap, which came with miso soup for a total of $5. I was in and out of the store, quite literally. They are very fast and very friendly! The space was also very clean. There were no other customers at the time that I went. As for the food itself, it tasted like food made with love and was so satisfying. The sunny kimbap had carrots, egg, braised burdock root, spam, danmuji, cucumber, and some tofu thing I think. There were 10 slices in total. So full of ingredients, but so beautifully presented! The miso soup was nothing special, just regular miso soup. For the price, the quality is awesome and makes for a great meal. I am interested in trying other items on the menu. They have some sample bento boxes to show you how large they actually are and they look worth it. I look forward to coming back and you should definitely give Sunny Kimbap a try!"
2080,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,A new clean Kimbap/ fast food Korean spot in bayside! I enjoyed the chicken teriyaki Kimbap which included chicken cutlet bits caramelized with teriyaki sauce and it came with miso soup. The menu is quite extensive as well; I can't wait to try the pizza rice cake!
2081,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,"Been wanting to try this place for awhile and I'm so happy I finally did! Went on a Monday for lunch around 1:30 and it was packed! The menu has so much variety! There's really something for everyone! My husband had the set meal A. It was enough food for 2 meals!! I had the Rice Cake and dumpling soup. The dumplings were delicious, I wish there were more in my soup! Can't wait to come back and try something else!"
2082,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,It's alright nothing special. Not better than I expected. Kimbap got no efforts. It's big but the taste is mediocre. It's big for nothing. I would not comeback. It's overpriced for its taste and quality.
2083,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,"I saw this new place on my way to the LIRR recently so decided to give it a try this morning. I went in to order a sandwich and kimbap to go but they said they cannot accept credit card at the moment due to a network issue. I didnt have cash with me so was about to leave but they said it was fine and I can pay at my next visit. I was really surprised and asked multiple times if it was really ok and even offered to leave my credit card info but they insisted that it was ok with a big smile! The restaurant is very clean with nice design. As for the food, I think all kimbaps on Northern Blvd taste about the same so it was nothing special, but will definitely return because of the location and super friendly service!"
2084,bycHoZQmpDgT58ikQ7kSyA,Fantastic little place. I had the tuna kimbap and bulgogi rice sandwich. Both were very good and reasonably priced. Will be coming back again!
2085,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,The food is GREAT!!! I love the Good ole fashioned soul food restaurant. The place is clean and the servers are friendly. When I enter this establishment I feel like I'm down south....just a humble and quaint place to be!!
2086,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"First time in a longtime, I was not disappointed. The service was nice and friendly and the place was nice and clean.  I ordered the smothered pork chops , mac and cheese with greens. Everything was tasty, but the greens was a bit dry and cut way too wide for my liking. The chops was tender and the gravy had me licking my fingers! LolFor desert I had the peach cobbler, man, was that good!!! So overall , I liked the order very much."
2087,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"My husband decided to be adventurous and look up the top 5 soul food restaurants  in Mount Vernon. Needless to say this restaurant popped up as number 1. I was very disappointed when I tasted the food despite many good reviews and a long line at the restaurant. He ordered 2 chicken meals and a rib meal. I ate the fried chicken meal. The wing was the size of my 2 hands and the thigh was the size of my foot. To some this would be a good thing, but that smells like a whole bunch of hormones to me. The greens had no flavor, and the Mac and cheese should be called ""Mac""because there was absolutely no cheese. The chicken had no flavor but I must say the ribs was OK! It was a nice portion with the meal averaging 12$, which is typical with soul food spots, they threw in cornbread for free which many other soul foods don't. I will say the customer service was good."
2088,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Really delicious food is to be had at King's. These folks know how to fry food to perfection. I've heard of fried chicken that ""shatters"" when you bite into it; never had it before King's. The fried fish and seafood are just as amazing. The sides are all delicious. The cornbread (which you get in addition to the two sides that come with every meal) is just a little bit sweet, and it's lighter than what I've eaten before - just fantastic. We had the peach cobbler and the coconut pineapple cake for dessert. Both are just wonderful, and the cake is very pretty. You have to try this place!"
2089,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Another great spot near my neighborhood. The staff is great, the food is delicious. I just wish I could get it delivered but I live to far (not even sure if they deliver).There is meter parking which I mention because sometimes the lines can be long. They have an app card where after 10 visits you get a free dinner. *NOTE that's 10 visits not 10 dinners. If you purchase 3 dinners at the same time that's 1 visit.I would recommend King's Southern Delight in Mt. Vernon, NY (because there appear to be another one in Ga.).About the picture of pork chop dinner. Half the meal was already eaten by the time I remembered to take a pic. There were 2 prom chops. LOL"
2090,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Good food, clean location. Good organized service. Customer smart service. I remember when the location was Brennans a German grocery store in the 60s.Brennan would be happy."
2091,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"I've been eating here for years! I love this spot, but depending on the time of day you go the line may be a bit long. I think I've tried everything on their menu but the ribs (I'm not a big bbq sauce person) but I definitely love their pig feet with yams and rice with black eyed peas. Can't forget about their 50/50 lemonade/iced tea drink in the warmer seasons..."
2092,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,What a delightful experience at Kings! Me and my daughter were passing through and found Kong's in yelp! We both got fried chicken and sides. The cornbread was dynamite! Definitely glad we stopped by!
2093,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,Good neighborhood soul food spot for take out.  The fried fish is always crispy and the corn bread is moist and tasty. The other side dishes are good but the collard greens and needs more flavor. The service is good but can be busy on Sundays. There are always good desserts to choose from.
2094,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,There food is not all that flavorful and if you are big on flavor that is not the place. Soul food is suppose to be made from the soul. I will stick with just making my soul food at home.
2095,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Amazing food. So delicious could eat 7 days a week. Wide variety. Dont miss out. Ribs,chicken meatloaf. Ready to go."
2096,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"So yesterday,  Saturday,  August 5, 2017, I came to this restaurant and bought some food for my father and I. We both got the fried whiting fish dinner. Dad got collard greens and rice with peas. I got collard greens and yams. Can I tell you how much this place blessed me!!! From the moment I walked in the door everyone was so incredibly hospitable! Customer service is everything to me especially if I'm giving you my money!! So, I'm literally back again today, Sunday, August 6, right now writing this review as I'm standing on line. This in gonna try the turkey wings, which I heard were tantalizing to ones taste buds. I'll be back with another review one today's meal."
2097,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"THIS IS HOW FOOD IS MADE! REAL SOUL BEHIND THAT FOOD!! Love this place and of course I keep coming back for more. Friend put me on and I've been on them since. Food is always made right, seasoned right, correct temperature.... I could really go on.The hospitality, service, quickness is amazing and truly appreciated. I'm one of those that likes to get home and/or destination to eat. Swear the only place that be having me anxious to get in that car and chow down. Wait for what!? In all my visits I have yet to have complained about a plate! This is THAT spot. I thank them all for introducing me onto New and Real!"
2098,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"I'm happy I was referred to King's! Now, I can enjoy tasty down home southern cooking that's not too heavy on the salt. The love and care put into each dish is evident. But, the FRIED WHITING is an absolute must try when visiting this clean, friendly, well priced GEM!Thanks for our awesome meals we today. We don't live in Mt. Vernon, but we'll definitely drive over to get our soul food cravings satisfied!"
2099,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,the Fried chicken and Mac & Cheese were on point
2100,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,Looking for unapologetic old school down south style Southern cooking all this is it. Pull up to the front and it looks like you are down south. Inside humble decor but the food is freshly prepared (new trays always coming out) nothing is ever sitting. And the customers all know Soul Food so you know it's good. Turkey Wings now and meaty cooked perfectly with the right gravy. Tasty juicy fried chicken. Mac and cheese. Collared greens. Cabbage. All greens have no meat besides smoked turkey. Whiting on Fridays. And pork options for those who choose. Try it!
2101,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Their food is always on point. I don't think there is even one food item that is not delicious. However my complaint is to the customer service by management. Word of advice, just because you serve good food doesn't mean you can treat your customers anyway you like. Try taking some courses in customer service 101 and attitude adjustment."
2102,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,There are less than five restaurants serving fried chicken perfectly seasoned and as tasty as I have just foundNow there are five!The Mac and cheese as a side is a home run as well as the ribs Going back for seconds
2103,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"I come here every few weeks but never reviewed...such a shame! Hands down best smothered pork chops. It doesn't seem like slopping gravy over a pork chop needs skill but plenty of places try to throw a (salty) gravy over horrible cuts of too fatty pork. Southern Delight has nice cuts with good balance and a savory gravy.The Mac n cheese is really good but could use more crust. Personal preference I guess.The potato salad, greens, yams and fried chicken are all really good. Get the fried chicken and ask for them to pour over smothered gravy or BBQ sauce. You get crispy chicken but with saucy goodness.The ribs themselves are not that great which makes me sad. It's very saucy with no char and despite all the sauce the meat is a bit dry. I only tried them once so maybe it was off night? The other downside is the dessert. It's not bad just not great. Pineapple coconut cake could have been more moist. This is a great family owned business though and the people are sooo friendly and good people. They saw me return money to someone who dropped it unknowingly and I got a free meal for being a Good Samaritan!"
2104,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Food was delicious, prices were great and the service was good! Was just looking for nearby soul food spots here on Yelp and found this place...I decided to try it and I'm glad that I did!! Had Pork Chops with Yams and Collard Greens and my wife had the Ribs! We will definitely be back!!"
2105,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,I haven't had a disappointing meal yet from KSD. Their food is always consistent and their $$ are great. One meals last me a couple days. My favorites are the fish and greens. The fish is always fresh (I even asked the owner details about that).  There is often a wait but definitely worth it.
2106,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"What a find... Was looking for a slice of pizza for lunch and stopped here instead.  Pig's feet,  sweet yams,  potato salad and cornbread for $6.50. Absolutely delicious."
2107,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"I happened upon this place while looking for soul food near me, I'm at Ridge Hill. The fried chicken was crispy and moist, loved the Mac & Cheese and Candied Yams, the ribs were great too. Returned on Mon at 1:30pm it was closed. That was the only disappointment!"
2108,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"This seems to be the only Southern cuisine restaurant left in Mt. Vernon.  The Owner and the Son are friendly, jokester,  Christian folks.  When they are around you are sure to leave with a smile on your face.  I love love love their turkey wings.  They are a nice size and you get 2 of them.  The mac n cheese and potato salad are ok ( I have taste better).  Their yams, collard greens and cabbage are great.  Their cakes are good..I never get their fried chicken because they pre cook it and sit it under a light. That's not my cup of tea Southern Fried chicken should be cooked fresh.  Their fried fish is ok and fried to order.  Seating sit approximately 1o people.  I never seen a bathroom tho'.  Dinner prices can run from 9.00-13.00 and of course comes w/ 2 sides.  Overall a nice experience.They also give you free cornbread and a mint with every meal...lol"
2109,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"I love this place and try to go whenever possible.  They accept cash or credit and it is extremely casual dining if you stay.  Most people take their food to go although the staff is very friendly.  I usually get the fried chicken but the catfish is slammin' too.  One of my friends absolutely LOVES the meatloaf, but I have something against meat that has been pressed into shapes...  Other friends like the turkey wings.  Anyway, the yams, Mac and collards are delish and my usual sides.  Can't complain except that I wish that they were open later!  Also, one of my friends that frequents the restaurant says that Sunday is the day to go but to go early!  Apparently they have this stuffing that is to die for.  But I would t know."
2110,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Amazing food. Pleasant family run restaurant. So many choices. Turkey wings, collards, fried whiting, candied yams., fried chicken. Everything is done extremely well. Highly recommended."
2111,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,Fish with hot sauce! Never fails to hit the spot.
2112,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"If you want delicious food and an atmosphere that reminds you of a southern flare, come here. The pork chops in gravy yummy, baked turkey wings are always a winner, the fried chicken is moist for the most part and tasty, Mac and cheese could use more of a sharp cheese taste but still good, fried whiting lite and delicious. I have tried they potato salad yet, but you know how hard it is to try someone else potato salad. Oh the sweet potatoes and green never miss!"
2113,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Great food at a decent price. I prefer their turkey wings, with mac and cheese and yams but everything is good. Also on specific days the restaurant makes peach cobbler, delicious. There is limited room for seating, so I would advise just picking up the food and taking it home. But it is worth the drive."
2114,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"Absolutly grotesque, cooked very badly, waste of my money, fish smelled horrible. I wish I had kept my money in my pocket and stayed home. I can't believe they serve me that food with a good conscience. The fish was baked or fried in a thick cornmeal crust which was almost impossible to chew avoid at all costs."
2115,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,I was convinced by my friend/neighbor to try this food but was very scared to because most soul food restaurants use alot of salt/sodium in the food. I was very pleased to know that this restaurant did not use alot of salt. I actually enjoyed my dinner which consisted of Fried Chicken/String Beans/Potato Salad and Cornbread. IT WAS SO DELICIOUS!!! I also had the chance to taste the fried whiting which was EXCELLENT!!! Thanks Mildred Harding for convincing me to try this food. I JUST WISH THEY DELIVERED!!
2116,21f3Dt7lJFx3tAPWY2W-hQ,"One of my fave places. The baked chicken, fried chicken, and turkey wings are awesome! Yams, collard greens and potato salad are on point too! They also have ribs, pork chops and even pig feet for that southern experience... I don't eat pork though so can't tell you about that but most likely they are tasty as well.  The young man at the counter is very hospitable also."
2117,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"I love this place. The people are so nice and so attentive. I try to stop by at least once a week and it always feels like a big happy family. Once in a while you'll get a customer who thinks it's appropriate to be on the speaker phone so we could listen to their conversation but nothing I can't handle. I just politely tell them to take it off speaker. You can't go wrong. Try it, their food is always fresh and yummy."
2118,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,This restaurant was actually REALLY good because we were in a hurry so we had to use uber eats! I would definitely recommend this place for anybody who has a more favorable taste in good old fashioned food.
2119,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"Went on a Sunday morning and the service was sooooooo slow.  We didn't get menus for a good 20 minutes.  Then the waiter didn't come back around for another 20 minutes.  The food finally came out in another 20 minutes.  My pancakes were so chewy...and the Canadian bacon was ok.  I wasn't even offered the donut.  So took an hour to get some inedible pancakes, super disappointed.Bad food, bad service, won't be coming back"
2120,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"We're from Brooklyn. We Yelp searched this place while waiting to have a car part rebuilt out here in the BX. Charming Old school style diner surrounded by newer businesses such as Dunkin Donuts and banks. Cute place,  good diner food..wish more places like this still existed!"
2121,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"Awesome little diner.. Great food, and service...definitely better going to a big diner"
2122,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"I have to say I haven't given Pete's the best review, so here goes. Pete's restaurant, a family place, it kind of remind me of cheer's and I'm Norman. every time me and my family come in, they know what we want to order and always ask my wife how is her parent . I love going there almost every Sunday, but it's just as good in the week day. this place is my Cheer's."
2123,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"Great place for breakfast & lunch, but I love when I place and order I alway get a free donut with my order.This is a great place to stop by before you hit the road."
2124,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"Out of all the diners in the Bronx/Tremont area, Pete's is definitely my favorite. Whenever I come home I make sure to stop by here for breakfast before I head back to Long Island. It's small but I think what I like most about this place is the home-like/community atmosphere. Service is so friendly and welcoming. Oh and their donuts are great, always pick up a french cruller before I leave."
2125,RExJXA0jk7She4GiDk43gw,"This joint looks like it could have been here since the 1950's (It hasn't, actually opened in the 80s) but it could have been the definition of greasy spoon. You can picture men in three-piece suits and hats sitting here on a rainy day waiting for the bus over steaming cups of coffee. It's relatively cheap, and VERY unhealthy (GREASY spoon, right?) but the service is good, and there's a really community atmosphere here."
2126,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,This was my first time coming to Roy's Bar NOT the restaurant. This is an a two in one. You have the restaurant entrance and the bar side. The bar is a pretty spacious size. I was brought here by a friend who recommended it for Happy hour. I was not disappointed at all! Great cubetazo special ( Beer bucket). The DJ was AMAZING!!! So BIG shoutout to the DJ! He played so much great music that took me back to the 90s. To add I didn't stop dancing nor singing once!! Great place if you're looking for good music and drinks and food all in one place. I would definitely come back.
2127,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I tried this place for the first time after considering for a while. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE! I ordered the chicharron de pollo sin hueso with rice and beans. The rice and beans were so good, BUT the chicken was not only flavorless but wasn't fully cooked! There was so much red in the meat I spit it out immediately. I opened up a few pieces of the chicken and they were all red! I had to throw it out or else I'm sure I'd have food poisoning. When we contacted the restaurant they refused to give a refund."
2128,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I walked in on a Sunday with two friends. We looked around it was empty. We waited to be greeted but no one was around. We decided to sit and a waitress came from the back room. She gave us 3 menus but one was missing 2 pages and one was dirty. We asked for new menus. She told us there were no specials today. We were asked what we wanted but we needed more time to decide. We were hungry as well. We ordered a pina colada, blue Hawaiian and a strawberry mojito to start. The appearance definitely will fool people. The piña colada had no alcohol and had to ask the waitress two times. The blue Hawaiian was pure sugar and the strawberry mojito...I should of knew just by the color. First, she brought me a regular mojito and I told her I ordered a strawberry. Then she bought me a strawberry and it tasted so watery. I again was not satisfied ...I told her it did not have any alcohol she went back to change it but it still tasted the same. I gave up after that.I was ready to go and that we did. Customer Service was a downfall! I will not return to this restaurant."
2129,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I was in the Bronx for an interview and I was starving. Roy's was about 4 minutes from my location so I drove. Parking was fairly easy and once I came in the set up was a little weird. It's a bar/restaurant/nightclub with an area for take out. I ended up sitting in the take out area but due to slow service moved myself to the bar. The food was delicious and the service outside of the sitting area was bomb.
2130,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I have to say that it wasn't what I expected. It smelled great but not only was my bag full of sauce spilled all over but it was sweet like they add sugar to it. The mofongo had to have been frozen not made fresh at all. It was so hard it bent my metal fork . I've had my share of this dish at many places and this has been the worst. $14 bucks to the trash.
2131,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Happy hour treatment wasn't that good . Wings are small everything you order is small. If you are not a male waitress ignore you .
2132,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,All the food was good . I had it delivered by uber eats . I will recommend for other people. The chicken was good and the Pernil was on point even the cuerito. The beans and the rice was pretty good too. You know is Hispanic sazón so if you want that Hispanic flavor this is the spot for a nice family or event dinner .
2133,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,This place rocks. The drinks are good and the pasta is banging. Be sure to brush up on Spanish as the hostesses only speak Spanish.
2134,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I placed an order for delivery, the order came am hour late, food was cold, food was spilt out into the bag, and the juice was spoiled. To pay $21.56 for this is unacceptable. I tried calling to explain what happened but was hung up on."
2135,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I live a few blocks from here but never been until today. Their food was pretty good. I had this penne vodka w chicken and my friend had a mofongo. I would def come here again ...
2136,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I never been to restaurant its self. Had it delivered to me three times. Food is delicious no complaints there. As for their delivery guy worst in the business attitude sucks. which sucks won't order from them anymore cause I can't support a place that allows someone to mistreat their customers. Overall great Spanish food
2137,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Best item for me is the tres golpe which contained (mashed green plantains, fried cheese, fried egg and salami) it is a bit heavy so one serving is good for two. It is amazing if you get it fresh off the stove it's really worth it."
2138,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,The food was good! Happy hour to 8:00 pm the bathroom was clean no complaints parking is the only bad thing waitress was decent not a bad place will come again!
2139,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Long story short...My food was disgusting.The meat was dry, beans burnt , alcapurrias ober fried & to add more to the mix..my tres leche was molded !!! It was expired !!!Never again!!!"
2140,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Worst service ever , servers are only interested in serving people they know. Wings were mediocre at best. If you like sh*t service and on food come here!!!"
2141,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Bad service. Wasnt ready to order, waiter came back 2 times and i still wasnt ready so she said she is not going to serve us because she already came back twice. Also said the manager was not here, how convenient."
2142,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"This restaurant sucks!!!!!! Always something with them. Sometimes they forget something in my order....Sometimes the food is just blah...depending on the chef. Delivery is horrible!!!! I live 15 mins away....it was 1 hour and 40 mins and my food never arrived. Called the owner, Rafael, several times and he just kept saying it's on the way. Which was a lie. I ended up buying Chinese which arrived right away and cancelled my order with Roy's. Still waiting for a refund since I paid online. They lost me a customer! Never again!!"
2143,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"The food taste old/stale, not fresh and overpriced. Stay away from their rotisserie chicken is very salty and will raise your blood pressure. The sweet plantains taste soggy,old, hard and artificially sweeting. The customer service is unprofessional and uninviting. If you around the way go to El Bohío instead, food taste so much better. Btw I'm Dominican and I know a few things about the Dominican cuisine."
2144,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I still stand by what i said. Roys has delicious food. I always order from them and still will. However the only issue i have is with their new delivery guy.  Roys was the only resturaunt that delivers to my door. Every time i ordered, the previous delivery guy was always polite and always came upstairs. This new guy? He calls us, tells us to come down stairs and is super lazy. We ask ""are you coming up?"" He replies with ""no im not coming upstairs "" and then hands me (or my husband) the food when we come down and says ""here"" and peddles off. He doesnt get off his bike at all. I know this isnt a big issue but for some, like us it is for us. The reason why we order from them is because they are or shall i say were the only people who delivered to our door. Being home alone with a child i cant go downstairs and grab the food. So its a inconvenience."
2145,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I absolutely love Roy's. Their food is amazing. I order from them all the time. Delivery is pretty fast and the delivery guys are pleasant. I would highly recommend them to anyone craving some great spanish food.
2146,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Lunch and dinner plates are delish and good portions. Try the pepper steak. Tostones. Rice and beans. Reasonable prices. Just had a breakfast item (mangu) for the first time. Portion was awesome but taste wasn't the best.they're was a weird after taste after every bite. I'm a very picky coffee drinker. I give them kudos to the coffee. Coffee was good. Not watered down.
2147,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Worst experience ever they forgot part of my food and won't answer the phone very very very bad service
2148,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I wish I could give these people no stars. I placed an order of boneless fried chicken chunks  with white rice and beans plus pepper pork chops with tostones . I received fried chicken chunks with BONES full of old oil! The rice was super salty and the beans forget about it all I tasted was salt. The pepper steak has disgusting gravy that looked old I never received tostones I received medium size beans! I called the restaurant  and the idiot that picked up was trying to tell me I told him wrong , when I repeated it more then twice. I spent 27$ on garbage! To top it off he didn't even want to accommodate me. Guys I truly do not recommend these people I don't even know how a restaurant can be open for business with such disgusting food."
2149,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"It's my second visit since moving back to the Bronx...and it didn't disappoint. I was with a friend who is new to NYC and we were looking for a real authentic Puerto Rican dinner feast. We ordered two dishes to split, best way to go for a full tasting experience...first dish: the oven baked chicken with tostones for $8 was a full half chicken right out of the oven with the meat falling from the bones. second dish: chicharron de pollo (fried chicken chunks) was made to order with yellow rice and peas, side order of red beans for $13 with enough chunks of white meat to feed three people that we had to take some home for later eating.final side dish is a must-have at Roy's the puerto rican pasteles $4 that was freshly made (and as close to the way Grandma made them from scratch)...all in all, good slice of home cooking for two at under $25.. Looking forward to a third visit soon!"
2150,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"This is a rough neighborhood, and mad props to anyone who can sustain a business here. Big portions, low prices, solid Puerto Rican comfort food. A big plate of roast pork came with rice & beans, plus a couple of fried plantain slices, for under $10, incl a can of soda. Lots of families when I went. Decent food and a pleasant atmosphere."
2151,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Food came really fast didn't like how my plantains came put but overall food was delicious
2152,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Nice and cool peopleFood was okayRice was very overcooked and taste burnt. The soft plantains tasted amazing and I don't eat those things. The bill was cheap but not worth it. The place was very dirty. The waitress/busgirl did nothing but sit back and chatted with the cute cook and everyone else in the back. One man was in the back with a 40 bottle in he's hand making jokes while drunk.... Wtf? Will not return. Our table was dirty and they left an old pitcher filled with water on our table. My husband asked for them to move it pleas.My husband enjoyed the food food but agreed that it was dirty.
2153,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Ordered food and it never came so I called the store 2 hours into waiting on my order and was told my order was on its way to me but alas I've been waiting 3 hours and I call the store and was now told my order was cancelled! Worst customer service and the food wasn't all that great.
2154,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,I love the roasted chicken at dis place it's the businessWell seasoned done to the bone .yellow rice is delicious an staff is friendly prices are really good a whole chicken is $8.00 can't beat it great food
2155,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Good sized portions, friendly service,tasty food and good prices. The roast pork I had the first visit was amazing. Lots of perfect crackling, black beans and rice and gravy and sweet plantains.Bbq chicken second visit was dry."
2156,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"They don't even deserve 1 star! The worst customer  service ever. I placed an order one day and it never got delivered. I kept calling to check up on the order and I was told that it was on its way but they never came. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and tried to place another order on a different day and the woman kept saying "" dame un segundo"" and hung up on me 4 times. They use to have great service but as of lately, their service has gone down hill. They must have a new owner but I'm never spending a penny there again."
2157,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"I don't recommend ordering what we did from here. We called to ask what was in the pancakes deluxe and was placed on hold several times and transferred to five different people before someone could explain to us. We were not going to order after that but couldn't find anything else. The deluxe came with sausage, ham, pancakes and bacon. The meats were good. The eggs bland and tasted as if they were made with old or dirty oil. The pancakes though? I don't know what they made those with but it wasn't pancake mix! Maybe they're homemade and someone forgot the sugar and cornmeal or whatever the main ingredients are. I can't even describe the taste but please don't waste your money trying to figure out. My lazy ass will just make my own pancakes next time. #LessonLearned"
2158,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"This is my favorite local restaurant, from delicious breakfast to mofongo. Is always my first choice, tasty and perfectly cook..."
2159,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Have had both breakfast and dinner orders placed at this restaurant. The breakfast are a bit of a hit or miss, not consistent. Dinner on the other hand has been really good each time. Would recommend to someone. (they do get orders incorrect at times always double check your order before leaving establishment.)"
2160,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,One of the few decent Spanish restaurants by my house that delivers. Food is pretty good as well as portion sizes. But customer service is definitely in need of some help. Your experience will definitely vary based on who's answering the phone and they have substituted items or just flat out failed to include them without notice.
2161,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"Roys is solid. They make really old food with really good portions for a nice price. I love this place, No Lie! Couple things we order from time to time are the Chicharron de Pollo sin hueso (chicken chunks w/o bones), Pernil (roast pork), chicharron de puerco (fried porn chunks), rice, beans, tostones and green salads with avocado. They make a killer mofongo as well with a nice sauce to pour over it. The best thing of all is that you can order online with pretty decent delivery times. We haven't ordered anything we did not. Try Roy's for yourself, you won't be disappointed."
2162,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Horrible Customer service.I waited 3 hours for an order I didn't receive.Waiting for the most important meal (breakfast) of the day is not worth Roy's time. Don't order online.
2163,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,"These people are dishonest. I placed an order to be delivered. I looked at the menu after the guy left. I was overcharged by $4. I called the store and the guy who answers tells me he can't change what's in the computer even though it wasn't the price advertised in the menu. I asked him to send the difference back to me and he started laughing. Oh yeah and the food! Horrible! Rubber pancakes, weird tasting sausage. Only God knows what animal it came from. My son took a bite of his sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and quickly chucked the sausage into the trash. I had ordered mangu, sausage, fried cheese and eggs.  The mangu was so chunky. Not blended well at all. Huge chunks of plantain in the Mangu. I'm not kidding! I, like my son chucked the sausage in the trash. I only got one egg (most places give you two eggs) . The only thing I enjoyed was the cheese. My oldest son had the B.L.T. There was barely any bacon. So basically a lettuce and tomato sandwich. My youngest son was the one stuck with the rubber pancakes and mystery meat sausage. After calling a few times I finally got them to return $3. Even though the horrible mangu breakfast is listed in the menu as $6. They insisted the price had gone up. I will not be ordering from them again and I will let my neighbors and family know about the horrible food and equally horrible customer service."
2164,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,This food is so good and affordable! It's definitely not the fanciest place but sometimes that's where all the good food is. This is way better then the popular Puerto Rican restaurant near by Nuevo Bohio which by the way is very bland and overpriced. Definitely worth the trip.
2165,Z3zdsOwrsBCZGgw0ojx6vw,Horrible service. I received my food one hour late never got a call to tell me my food was coming late . The driver didn't know where he was going. He got lost coming to my house and he said they wrote the address wrong when I check it was correct. When I call the restaurant to complain because the food was cold and nasty they kept hanging up. Got me so piss never order from here again and it wasn't even the 1st time this happen
2166,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"So as Buffet's go......this place has a great turnaround where the bins of food stay hot, filled, full and fresh. There's a great deal of diversity from sushi to fish options. The hibachi section is great and the sweets casts.Plus the pricing don't hurt. Especially on Sundays!"
2167,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Very spacious! Enough parking, not to busy at all.Customer service and the waitress were attentive. All the food looked fresh and that it hadn't been sitting there for hours. I usually hate buffets because the food is gross and bland but in this case mostly everything I filled my plate with tasted great, I had about 3 full plates before I tapped out.Make sure to check out the sushi and hibachi in the back, I made my own chow mein and fried rice you get to choose the meat and toppings it was probably my favorite part. I don't remember pricing but it wasn't expensive, if you wanted to take food to go they give you a box to fill and they weigh it per pound. For whatever reason as I was saying buffets rub me the wrong way so even though I had a good experience I wouldn't wanna come back I'll stick to the buffets in Vegas they know how to do it right."
2168,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,I go here every few months with my parents- it's their fav spot. The hibachi station in the back is delicious ! They have a few vegan options. The sushi station is a hit! They have a few vegan choices- and the sushi is fresh. The service is superb.
2169,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This is the best buffet I've been to yet. It has the Chinese food you have in mind. This is definantly a MUST GO to. If you love Chinese food, this is the place to be at. The Bathrooms are clean, so as th"
2170,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This is the best buffet I've been to yet. It has the Chinese food you have in mind. This is definantly a MUST GO to. If you love Chinese food, this is the place to be at. The Bathrooms are clean, so as the food."
2171,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"I remember when this building was a CVS.We came here after visiting our old church, 4 kids and 7 adults. They accommodated us within minutes. Our waitress JoJo was polite and helpful. The place was super clean and bright. It was slightly crowded, including the employees with their carts  bringing out fresh food. The food was typical, many options including hibachi and a plethora of desserts.What I really loved was the diversity of the staff in all capacities. I loved that both the Male and Female bathrooms had changing tables and that they have 2 ranges of kid pricing based on age. I felt that was very appropriate. We enjoyed ourselves."
2172,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"First time at the Flaming Grill franchise. A cheap, no frills place if you want to stuff your face. It was just okay. There are lots of choices  for those that are picky. Service was good with no wait, no issues. Hibachi was okay. Steak is a little chewy. Just beware of the massive salt intake. I love salt but wow. I guess it's the point of these buffet style restaurants, as to drink more and fill up fast. Its reasonably priced and on site parking is available. In all cheap eats similar to take out."
2173,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Phew I decided to go to a Buffet in my neighboring town of Mount Vernon, NY. I decided to do takeout. When you arrive and open the first door you are greeted with with a purple sign stating the name of the restaurant. In order to do takeout you grab your To go plates from the payment counter then you proceed to grab the food that you would like. They have a very large selection of foods to choose from. As of this review the to go pricing is $5.99 per pound. I ordered $22 dollars of food which was split between two containers. They offer .50 ccent to go  ice cream bars.The food was ok nothing special It offered everything that you would find in a traditional Chinese buffet. If you are dining in they do have a Hibachi grill in the far back right corner.I would definitely come back if I am in the mood for a little bit of everything and unsure what I wanted. Standard Chinese buffet close to my house."
2174,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Flaming Grill is a huge Asian buffet near Pelham  Manor and Mt. Vernon (near Target). The other day, I discovered this place on a shopping trip to Target, and boy I'm glad I did.First off, they feature about 10 buffet bars, each with a different theme! ...and each are pretty tasty!The food bars include: a salad bar, a cold seafood bar, a soup bar, a hot seafood bar, two Chinese food bars, a Mongolian grill, a sushi bar, an ice cream station, and a dessert bar! Oh, and it's likely I left something out!!To try: --Streamed fish! Very yummy!--Wonton soup. Simple but tasty. I added a bit of hot sauce--Pan-fried wontons--Lo mein. A bit overcooked but super flavorful--Sauteed seafood dish. Yummy! Packed with shrimp--Salt and Peppper Chicken. Make sure you get some when a fresh batch comes outTake it or leave it:--General Tso's Chicken. Not the best but not the worst I've had--Peel-and-Eat Shrimp. Good but not great--Sushi bar. Average but gets the job doneTo avoid:--Raw oysters. Previously frozen; not worth the calories--Stuffed shrimp. Just okay. Save your calories for other delicious nuggets at FlamingAs for atmosphere, this place looks new and modern inside. The lights are dim, but that's good because others won't see how much you are gorging!"
2175,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"The place has a good parking spot and although the restaurant looks small outside, it's actually pretty big inside. There is a variety of selection. We went for a weekday lunch. The sushi is pretty fresh in the sushi bar. A big fan of mango cucumber salad. Super fresh and very refreshing. I wish there are raw oyster/clam and some king crabs available for choice. Not a bad place for the price you paid. Will come back again for another visit."
2176,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Food was ok, nothing special. Good selection of food. Friendly staff. Ate in and didn't take anything to go. Parking lot out front that is shared with a three other businesses in the plaza. The raspberry iced tea was really good!"
2177,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This basically the best place I ever went to eat Asian buffet I use to go to the one on central ave in Yonkers but this is more modern has fresh well done foods is also has seafood different types of meat, rice, veggies, pizza, sauce,salads, beverages , soups ice cream ice box bar & desserts me my and family came here it's really good they have a sushi bar in the back flaming Grill also in the back to choose what u what to be cooked in the grill and also in back a private room it's clean rest rooms and prices are fine you pay to stay on table $15 per person and price to pay is by pound Saturday is cost $12 for to order to take out employee services is fantastic free parking but the bad thing is that they don't sell liquor so anytime u wish to go enjoy;$$'"
2178,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Very clean buffet...I thought the food was good not as hot as I would like but taste was a 7 out 10. I liked the size of the restaurant and the seats. My daughters love buffets and they have this place thumbs up so I'm happy about that. I gave it a 3 because I didn't think they had a huge selection of food. I also think that with all the heat stations they have it should have been a little more organized like meat on one, rice and pasta on another like everything was everywhere."
2179,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This place is huge! They have hibachi and a sushi bar. I went for takeout on this day. I generally do not like Coconut Shrimps but here there Coconut Shrimps are so good. The Calamari is also very good, tender and seasoned well.I've been here a few times since they opened and I've enjoyed the food and the staff has been pleasant on every occasion. If you want seafood go after 1500 hrs. it seems they put the seafood out for dinner.Oh and they have lots of desserts, I haven't had any desserts so no review.PS. At the time the picture was taken the restaurant was actually closed, I had got there at 2230 hrs. unaware that's there closing time. That's why it's empty."
2180,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"The restaurant is in a good location, and has a parking lot with lots of spots available. The ambiance is very laid back The decor is nice i love how open the floor is The staff here is very nice and helpful You cannot beat the price and they also offer carry out My only fault is that the food isn't that great... meaning a lack of seasoning. My favorite thing was the fried rice && chicken and broccoli as well as the hibachi station where i had noodles and chicken. I honestly won't be coming back here but that's just a preference."

2182,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"The selling point here is the price, which was $14.99 per person on the weekend for dinner. Yes, you're not getting the greatest food you'll ever taste but pretty much everything I tried was ok to good. I would chalk this up as a win for an AYCE buffet at this price, even more so when you don't get the runs afterwards.The better options were the hibachi station, the cheese wontons, the ribs, the garlic bread, the salt/pepper chicken, the fried dumplings, the fried fish and the general tso's.Dishes I probably wouldn't get again are the calamari and the chicken and broccoli.I didn't get to try the sushi or dessert stations since I just ran out of room.The restaurant itself is very large and clean - staff is very quick to clear plates, refill drinks and replenish food items on the buffet line.All in all, the buffet offers tons of options for a cheap price that makes it worth checking out."
2183,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"When I wanted Chinese buffet I would always go to he one in coop city. Not the one next to the supermarket but the one that moved like two years ago to the new location, it's always been my safe pick.You know from time to time you want something new I'm glad I picked this place for my friend and I who were visiting from out of town this literally has to be the best Chinese buffet  I have had in nyc. clean atmosphere of customer service  and the food was great no complaints. The sushi was fresh and the cake had whip cream icing that I love. This place was good  went around 8:30pm and they closed at 10pm but the selections was still all there.  It might seem like it's a lil far out there but it's worth the drive."
2184,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Very clean, good prices, great selection, deep freezer of different wrapped ice creams, very spacious !"
2185,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,We had a big group for the new year day  yesterday  I'm disappointed for the food a little bit Nothing special much ... I walked to wait for the lobster  3 times but never got it...Wait and wait...over all food is ok( seafood)One thing the bathroom was  super dirty No tissue and dirty!
2186,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Great service. Fresh food .totally impressed .also loved the decor .I will be coming back
2187,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,I've visited this location several times. On my first visit I tried various food items. They were just OK. I do say I like the salt and pepper crabs. On my prior visits i only eat from the hibachi grill that way I know my food is well seasoned to my liking and cooked well. I like the ice cream sandwiches that they have is part of the dessert. Can't really complain because it's not that expensive and it's local.

2189,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Food is okay for buffet. The best part is hibachi station where you can make your own meal. The desserts are not great. The service is great. They take plates quickly, replenish drinks quickly, and don't rush you to leave. I'd come here if I'm nearby but would not go out of my way. I also would not come here for anything other than lunch."
2190,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,The buffet was fabulous. The sushi was great. They had numerous choices. They have a hibachi grill for you to choose your own ingredients and watch them grill it up for you. The salads were excellent and they had so much variety. There is definitely something for everyone here. The ice cream is packaged ice cream bars. All you can eat and very good. I highly recommend coming here.
2191,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Food is very good. They have a good variety. I've been here with my family on 3 separate occasions. Some of the waitresses are a bit obnoxious. Many families go there for birthday celebrations and it can get a bit annoying having to hear the happy birthday blasting over the loud speakers every 5 minutes. I wish they would just sing it to the party celebrating instead of having everyone in the restaurant here the same song repeatedly. Overall, it's a good place to eat and inexpensive. But one thing I did not like is that when it was time to pay the bill the waitress showed each one in our party that was paying separately the receipt and told us the amount instead of giving us the receipt in our hands.  We then gave her a debit or credit card to pay. But as she started to walk away it hit me that I was being charged about $3.00 more than the cost of the buffet dinner. When I called her back and questioned the price she didn't respond so I asked to see the bill again and when I checked I was charged two dollars and change for a tip of 18%. When I alerted the rest of my family, my nephew had already paid for his family and added a tip over and above the tip automatically charged by the restaurant. When it's time to pay the waitress shows you the bill really quick and tell you the total owed while still holding onto the bill. All the customer focuses on is the total shown on the bill. If one is not too careful, you'll be paying for a tip twice because whether you pay by credit or debit card they take it along with the original bill to the cashier then return later and give you the receipt to sign. The receipt gives you 3 options for paying a tip: I think the first one is 15%, but not sure, 18% and 20%.  For those who do not question the original bill will assume a tip was not charged and will include a tip in the receipt they have to sign giving a tip twice. I found this practice pretty sneaky and I did not appreciate it. So, be diligent when paying."
2192,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Was as expected...reasonably priced. Food mediocre to good. Sushi was great. Did not try the hibachi. Restaurant was clean and reasonably busy for a Friday at 6pm. Staff were pleasant and accommodating. Plenty of options offered including ice cream for dessert. Will return in the future.
2193,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Food and scenery was awesome! Everything was fresh and they accommodate you if you have any allergies. I went for lunch and it was great. They also have a sushi and hibachi station. There was a variety of food from hot wings to lo mein. You can't take food to go and if you do they weigh it and you must pay. Staff is very attentive.
2194,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"The food was great . The environment is clean and the service is ok . I've notice that the fishes aren't label right e.g salmon isn't salmon. My wife is a pescatarian and know what fish is now what it should , that was the only issue. Will come again."
2195,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"First time visit. Very nice decor and layout. The service was typical buffet service nothing special. The food was pretty good, again buffet all you can type of menu.  I'll return for the dinner menu and see if there's a difference."
2196,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,The best Chinese food buffet hands down. The salt and pepper  were my favorite. The stuffed shrimp was meh and could have had more flavor. However everything else was delicious. They have a Hibachi and sushi station in the back. You have to hold your receipt in order to get drinks. The sodas were very crisp. I can't wait to go back.
2197,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Nice new buffet, Tina's hospitality is great luv this place. Parking is great, service is A+++++"
2198,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Food was just o.k. But they do have a wide selection. Love the decor. I would definitely come back .
2199,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"A really great place for an excellent meal value, with good service. My family and I enjoyed it very much. There were people in our party with varying dietary restrictions such as gluten-free, dairy free, vegetarian etc. There is definitely something for everyone! All of the staff was extremely friendly and attentive, and the place was clean. The food options are overwhelming, there is no way that you can try everything, even if you pace yourself! Great service at the hibachi station, good selection as well. $14 per person with hundreds of options including fresh sushi and hibachi, not to mention dessert. I just think you should be hard-pressed to find something to complain about!"
2200,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This buffet blew my mind. Whether it's lunch or dinner the food is always ""just prepared"". The place is spotless and the staff works extra hard to keep tables happy and full of selection. Every time I've eaten here the selection has been great! American, Chinese, Japanese, and Mexican cuisines can be found here. A must visit!!"
2201,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"My husband and I tried this location in our neck of the woods after trying the one located in Washington D.C. and this one is better. Located in a shopping area it has its own large parking lot and is bright, clean and the wait staff is on their job. The food fare here is affordable and offers Japanese, Chinese, Seafood and American dishes. The food here is not the best you've ever had but the real deal is in the back where the Hibachi station is where one can pick food options. I live a little more than several miles away and I would come just to take out from this station. If you are a Sushi lover stay away from the Sushi station! The food on some of these stations should be iced and some on top of very hot water so be aware! All in all its a buffet with alright food!"
2202,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"We were in the mood for a Chinese buffet last night and the lack of options in Yonkers led us to Mt. Vernon to give Flaming Grill a try. This place is marketed as a Chinese buffet with hibachi, sushi and other international options, and I would say that is a reasonable assessment, although IMO there were relatively few actual Chinese dishes. There was still plenty to choose from, though - buffet is quite extensive, with an entire table devoted to seafood dishes, one for (Americanized) Chinese dishes, one for ""international"" dishes (mostly kid-friendly American foods like mac and cheese, meatloaf, BBQ ribs, etc.), a table of fried stuff (egg rolls, fried shrimp, etc), plus sushi, hibachi, salad bar and dessert bar.We were pleasantly surprised to find the food was mostly tasty and consistently hot and fresh. The service at our table was non-existent - our waitress didn't even refill our waters - but the servers refilling the buffet were on top of things. The sushi wasn't especially high quality, about one step up from grocery store sushi, but not bad at all for a buffet. The decor was a bit cheesy, but the restaurant was brightly lit and clean, a nice change from the typical dingy buffet. Overall a good buffet experience. We'll be back."
2203,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Very calming setting when I go here for lunch. Plenty of space and PLENTY of food and deserts.Take out is quick and easy also when I'm in a rush. I eat here at least once a week and I'm never disappointed
2204,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Great place.  Service was quick and the staff were all very nice. There was an amazing variety of food here and a large amount of desserts too.  Would absolutely go back.
2205,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"When this first opened , i was happy that there was finally something good in Mount Vernon but let me tell you something ! I didn't get a stomach virus ONCE , i got it TWICE , and i couldn't eat anything besides soup and drink ginger ale for 4 days ! I don't know what happened from the first time they opened to now , but something has to give ! I can't even say anymore than what i already have because I'm so disappointed !"
2206,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,I wish I could give them zero stars. The food was dry and there were flies all over the food. They even gave me a stale fortune cookie. I wouldn't even bring my dog here.
2207,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Ok it's not the greatest food in the world but for $14 it's a steal. Large buffet but I only ate from the Hibachi( Mongolian bbq) station. Unlimited shrimp, white meat chicken, Beef, imitation crab, with vegetables and eggs( along with rice and noodles if you want) cooked fresh and hot. Since my office isn't far I'll be there several times a week. Definitely good for the price."
2208,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Ok folks let's really talk about these ""all you can eat"" buffets.I have been to a few in my life time , for example there is one in Elmsford, one in New Rochelle and now in Mount Vernon. These places are great economically speaking but has anyone notice who have also been to all 3 places that they service exactly the same dishes? The quality of the food is very poor when it comes to your health and well being so when your money is low and you feel like piging out its cool to go,  try to go no more then once a month because if you do your killing yourself."
2209,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"This place is such a wonderful buffet, for its price and location. Lunch and dinner prices are worth the steal as I've never went to a buffet that charges $10-12 per person. My boyfriend and I enjoyed the various selections of food which were fresh and always prepared to perfection. The desserts were divine and I highly recommend bringing your friends here! :)"
2210,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,First time here and they totally rocked it. First this place is like the TARDIS - totally bigger on the inside. Huge in fact. I think this is the largest buffet restaurant I have ever been too. Next a virtual sea of food and an unimaginable variety. They even have hibachi service at the very back! Lastly the decor is awesome with lit up walls. And all this for just 10 dollars lunch! I don't know how they do it. I will definitely be going back and bringing friends. Great job guys!
2211,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Food was really good. The price was awesome not to mention they have coupons lol. We went on a Sunday and it was a lot of church goes. The place was spotless, pleasant atmosphere, the staff is diverse and very courteous. My family loved it.  This will definitely be our new spot."
2212,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Not only did my boyfriend get food poisoning, the gave us a fake $20 as change and the wait was horrible. Never going back here ever again. Period!!"
2213,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Visited Flaming with hubby and 10 year old grand.Went to the buffet twice.  Immediately after, without a word, the check was placed in the middle of the table and plates removed.  Rude, will not return."
2214,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Parking can be difficult when it gets crowded, and that's alot of the time. This place is very large, as is the buffet. In fact, it's the biggest buffet I've seen outside of vegas. A to Z, Soup to nuts. But, stay away from the american items (ribs, brisket, etc.) and stick with the oriental items (stir fry station, Gen. Tsao chicken, sushi, etc.) And you definately can't beat the price. Bring a large appetite."
2215,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"Literally the best buffet, ever. It's very nicely decorated like it's modern and the  music is pretty hip. The customer service is on point. The hostess is pretty nice and the servers are kind and respectful. The food is super fresh and tasty. The chicken is fresh and they have some of the best chicken I've had at a Chinese food spot."
2216,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,"With all the Chinese Buffet I have visited throughout the country this has to be one of the cleanest, modern, tastiest and friendliest ones I've been to. Only better one is in Clearwater, FL. I've been to this location about 5 times. They have a self carving station that has a nice piece of beef, the usual Chinese fare, sushi station, fresh looking desert station (on keto so no go)and a hibachi station with large and fresh selections.  Its a new place and I hope it can stay clean and in excellent condition considering the neighborhood its in(ghettoish). Some items I would stay away from(anything with dairy since it spoils in the heat lamps). They even mail out coupons to my home for both lunch and dinner. Anyone one who has issues with this place should just stay home."
2217,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,This legit should be zero stars but thats not an option. This place has Extremely unprofessional staff and this is not the first time I've eaten here Came on a Saturday night March 9th when the place was legitimately packed to the brim. The wait was over 1 hour and they were not communicating about what table was next. I came with a party of 8 people and the wait was over 1 hour. We told the hostess we are more than willing to split the table into two tables of 4 each. They sat the first table of 4 down and when we asked how the next table of 4 will know when we can be seated the hostess had the audacity to try to give me another number to wait at the back of the line. I was APPALLED! She wanted me to wait at the end of the line yet again after over 1 hour of waiting. So unprofessional!! This is not the way to do business. And they wanted to blame this on the party in the party room that was 120 people.
2218,IZaIOOUNnZV2kgabfpwfFA,Came here cause I heard good things from Family and friends but I have to say the food was not good some was stale and definitely won't be coming back. Best thing was the dessert according to my kids. But even the ice cream wasn't good
