# Yelp Report Cards

Welcome to Yelp Report Cards.  In this project, if is my aim to produce a business value-add to Yelp's current business owner services by attempting to generate a baseline report card for restaurants generated from sentiment analysis using NLTK's Vader Sentiment Analysis and combining it with topic modeling using Genism's LDA library.

## The Business Case

Yelp is quite possible the largest review site in the world for local businesses, encompassing all forms of small businesses from doctor's offices to cleaning services.  At its core however, Yelp began as a crowd-sourced review site, democratizing the restaurant review process and bringing greater exposure to restaurants all over the world by soliciting user-generated content for the restaurants in its database.

Overtime, the popularity of Yelp as a restaurant information resource has led to the creation of millions of points of data.  This has somewhat diluted the impact of Yelp reviews for a restaurant and led to some discontent from restaurant owners.  Below are 3 of many points that resulted in dissatisfaction with business owners on Yelp.

**1.  Law of Large Numbers**

Due to the sheer volume of reviews, every review that goes into a restaurant ends up stabilizing their rating.  There it stays forever, usually at a 4.  At this point, most restaurants shoot for a 4, and only the truly best manage to get a 4.5.

**2.  Extreme Volatility**
