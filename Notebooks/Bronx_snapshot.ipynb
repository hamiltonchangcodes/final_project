This was my first time here and I was not disappointed.I'm a very picky eater so for me to go to a Latin Asian Fusion restuarant I was praying the food would be great.I follow you'll on IG and seeing the pictures of the food I was like I have to go there.As soon as I walked in I was greated and seated right away.So to get to my delicious food.To start my meal off i had the Lycheetini, now I've never eaten or drank anything lychee.The mix of the vodka, lychee puree and the coconut puree was just masterful.The creaminess of the purees with the vodka was just .Mae recommended the Eel Roll and Cynthia recommended the Lycheetini.So I went with the Eel Roll and The Shrinp Tempura Roll.The sauce that came on the plates of the rolls was a great balance of sweetness to the rolls, I was ready to lick the plate clean lol.I've never eaten Eel before to for this to be my first time I was not disappointed.I was reaching for another piece and realized it was all gone lolTo close out my meal I got the Cold Sake Bomb.The bomb had a nice sweet creamy but dry fell to it. I actually liked it more then I thought I would.Thank You Shangi Red, Mae and Cynthia for a great experience.P.S. I got the Teriyaki Salmon Bento Box to Go!!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I was really conflicted in writing this review because I wanted to love this place , I was excited to see that a Latin Asian fusion restaurant was coming to the neighborhood. I decided to visit on Sunday with my 2 daughters for dinner . We got a weird vibe even before we got out of the cab because there were a lot of guys in the front , we weren't sure If they were arguing or just hanging out .We make our way around the crowd into the restaurant there was no one there to greet us. We looked around to see if there was a host then all of a sudden, from behind us came this guy which I guess was the manager that was outside with the crowd. He brought us to a table next to the bar where other patrons were smoking hookah. That was a no no for me . They had a DJ it was really loud in there where we couldn't even hold a conversation. We order about 5 appetizers, the waiter comes back to tell us that they ran out of 3 appetizers. - WTH !! I didn't understand how you can run out of so many things . We ordered 2 lychee martinis and the Vivir soñando which took forever to get when we finally receive the drinks I see that they have a really pretty flower in the martinis I guess that's why they charge you $14!!!!!The drinks were not even cold and a really small martini glass not worth the price . Now let's go back to the Appetizers- ordered Thai wings - a lot of breading, Cuban egg rolls, ok but Luke warm Ropa Vieja empanadas,- good. Ribs - we had to return they were undercooked . My daughter ordered a sprite it was flat taste like Alka seltzer !! We returned it opted out for a coke which was also flat no carbonation! The manager comes by and asked what's wrong- I told him the soda issues and the ribs he apologized and said he would check. 10 min later he comes back and says he checked the wells downstairs and they seem to be fine . He's not sure why it taste the way it did . I asked did you taste it for yourself to see ??? He said yes then proceeded to say it must be the gun and that your not going to get a lot of carbonation out of a gun like a can !!! Are you serious ?? I've dined in many places and bars where they use a gun and the sodas are not flat !!! That was not cool at all it's like he didn't believe us . Now we get our food needless to say ok nothing to brag about . \\xa0I ordered the coconut chicken with fried rice , mind you on the menu it says Coconut fried chicken i got grilled chicken with a chipotle sauce which was good but not hot , the best thing was the fried rice it was delicious. My daughters ordered Shrimp pad Thai which she did not eat - she said it didn't taste good at all and she didn't have any noodles just some shrimp and a lot of veggies! At this point we didnt even mention it to the manager when he stopped by to ask how our meals were . I was already exhausted from the whole experience. Our bill was $126 which was not worth it at all. I'm very sad to say I will not be returning until they get it together. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the decor , and our waiter Juan was very sweet and informative and the Dj played good tunes even though we thought it was too loud for a Sunday night. This place is very confusing I thought I was coming to a restaurant but it looked like a lounge/ hookah bar / club .\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Note: This is a review for delivery, not dining in. The delivery estimate of 45-65 min was accurate, as food arrived in 65 minutes. I\\'m not too into \"fusion\" food in general, but delivery options in the Bronx are very slim, so we decided to give this place a try. We ordered: Thai Chili Wings ($12) - I was initially impressed that they had not dressed the wings prior to sending them, thinking \"Oh, that\\'s thoughtful. They just put the sauce on the side so the wings can stay nice and crunchy before I dress them.\" The salty wings were room temperature and so wet that they were soggy. The sweet Thai sauce tasted like store-bought chili sauce mixed with duck sauce and did not taste Thai-flavored at all. 1/5Pad Thai ($15) - for $15, it was an exceedingly small portion that didn\\'t even fill the takeout container halfway (see picture). It was very veggie-heavy, which I\\'d be fine with if this was actually pad-thai, which it wasn\\'t. It had soggy cashews mixed in (huh?), a handful of shrimp, and wide, over-cooked soggy noodles lightly stir-fried in a ton of soy sauce that tasted more like Chinese food than Thai. 1.5/5Spicy Salmon Roll ($8) - Typically spicy salmon rolls are about $5-7, so this was on the pricier side, especially when you take into consideration that the amount of salmon in there was VERY light. Also, this was more of an avocado-salmon roll than a spicy salmon roll, because the salmon was not dressed. Also, it was body-temperature from sitting in a bag with once-hot food, and the fish did not taste or smell fresh. I would not say that it had gone bad, but on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being super-duper fresh and 10 being rotten, I\\'d say this was a 6.5. I don\\'t mess around with not-fresh sushi, so I had to toss this. Also, no soy sauce was included. \\xa00/5Shanghai Burger with Yucca fries ($14). I ordered this burger well-done, because I generally don\\'t trust undercooked ground beef from most restaurants. The burger that came to me was not only not-well-done, but it was bordering on raw. It was so rare, as a matter of fact, that the fat in the ground beef was still white (see picture). Yucca fries were wet and soggy but still hard in the centers. 0/5Overall, I was unhappy with the food I received. Our meal came out to over $60 (!!!!!) with tip plus a $3.50 delivery fee, and there was not a single item that we enjoyed, and the majority of the meal had to be thrown away (we ended up having to order a pizza). Obviously this is just one person\\'s opinion, but at the very least, my two cents is that this restaurant needs to re-think their delivery containers and the timing of their delivery. If their food is sitting in a car for 40 minutes inside unvented plastic containers, there is no way that the sushi isn\\'t getting warm and all their hot meals are turning into mush from the condensation. TBH, not sure how much better the food would be if eaten fresh out of the kitchen, but for sure, I would not personally recommend this restaurant for delivery.',\n",

It's based, from what I understand, on the premise that they have traversed many lands and countries, and have fused the foods from those countries onto various dishes. The premise of this restaurant as a result, tends to create very delicious food ideas. Who would've thought a burger with sweet plantain (plátano maduros) would taste great? It did take a while for our food to arrive, given the large size of the party, and a few people that were there besides us. The food was served well on nice plates, and the restaurant was overall clean. I had no issues in general. I'd return again.\",\n",

Upon entry, we were given a very nice table and I'm assuming it's because she's a regular so they hooked us up. The server came to the table quickly and took our orders. They have some decent specials but we went with a bottle of Tempranillo for the table. We started with the Passion Ceviché, which was very good. The portion was small but it was served in a tiny, cute mini mason jar. I liked the flavor. As we do at most outings together, we ordered a slew of items to share. We had the French Avocados which are basically huge slices of deep-fried avocado and they were crunchy on the outside but creamy inside and flavorful. We also had the Golden Crab which are basically crab wantons. They were ok but the Argentinian Steak Pinchos were tender and wonderful! We also shared an order of the Oxtail Risotto which I would have to say, was an interesting take on risotto. The oxtail meat was tender and full of flavor, as was most everything we had; the risotto was creamy and not too cheesy. I was happy with that selection. The staff very attentive. We had a great meal and I would definitely make a return visit with hubby and my son.\",\n",

We had a good table, the staff was nice and accommodating but the food was horrible compared to my prior visits.They completely messed up our appetizer orders, giving us the wrong proteins with our tostone sliders. They looked pretty but they were not made right.I ordered their oxtail risotto because, that's the dish that had me in love with the place when I first visited. Unfortunately, this time it was far too salty and the risotto was way overdone. Since I was starving, I just ate what I could because, if you know me and my reviews, I never order anything else if I have to send a dish back to the kitchen. I'll sit and starve and then pick up something from somewhere else (don't judge).We've had 50/50 experiences since my vey first visit but I think this will he the last time we give them another shot. From what I've heard, they've changed chefs and that could be the reason for the inconsistency. Either way, Travesias won't be my next stop.\",\n",

Especially the hostess. Her name is (arcadia / sorry if I butchered that) but she is really accommodating and cares for the customers.The waitress was nice too (i didn't get her name) but she moves really quick so you better know what you want lmao. The food was good. I ordered the lobster tail with the Maduro fried rice + a side of mashed potatoes and beans. The potatoes looked delicious but were so bland and the lobster was a bit overcooked but good nonetheless.my Bf ordered the churrasco and maduro fried rice and he loved it.

The menu varies on days of the week which if you don't know the menu and want berenjena asada which is what I ordered, you would need to know which day of the week they offer it. Menu could be bigger. Restaurant is small for the amount of hype it has. Waiting is long. We went at 1pm and were seated by 2pm. Staff is very laid back. On the slow side to clear tables and get the waitlist moving. The place closes at 8pm so for people looking for a late dinner it's impossible. Must get more backed up the waitlist on the weekends.

I visited The Bronx Public today. My waiter was Lucas. He took our drink orders right away. Our drinks arrived in a matter of a few minutes. Our food order was swift also. He remembered the little details as well. I ordered the garlic chili wings and a basket of fries. The sauce on the wings was definitely more sweet than spicy the way I prefer. The fries were crisp and lightly salted. This is probably my 6th or 7th visit. I will definitely go to the Bronx Public again.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"This place isn't bad but it didn't win me over. What I enjoyed the most was the games they have available to play. I came with my girlfriend and we decided to play Giant Uno, which I proceeded to kick her a** in! We went on a Sunday evening and the atmosphere was very chill.As an appetizer, we ordered the nachos. They were good but not great. It tasted very similar to a sloppy Joe. The nachos come with chili, cheese, sour cream, and some jalapenos. If I were to get it again, I would try to substitute the chili for chicken.I ended up getting a cheese burger, which I topped off with a fried egg and bacon. It tasted fresh and cooked to medium (how I like it). The pickle it came with was my favorite, had the perfect crisp bite. I can see this place being fantastic for large groups. The reason I'm giving it three stars is because the place just felt didn't feel very personal. It may have been an off day for the staff and I'm definitely am willing to try the place again with a larger group of friends.\",\n",

The seating area in the back is pretty tight, so if you are a party of two be prepared to be in the middle and tight. Beyond that the service was quick and nice. Had the unlimited alcoholic drinks for $20 + my meal. The French toast was super sweet and soggy from the toppings. Definitely a sugar overload! Needless to say it wasn't bad but very soggy. The mimosa comes in the same wine glass as the sangria. You definitely get your money's worth with such a bigger cup. Drinks are strong, so that's a plus too! They also had games but with the tight seating, it wasn't conducive for games.\",\n",

I was excited to try a Vegan Restaurant in the Bronx and the live Dj is cool but I wish they'd focus more on the service. At the counter to order we waited a while to place our order, even tho we were the only ones up there.And someone came from the back/kitchen area (I'm guessing), he was handed the same dish I order, it's a slap in the face being hungry and seeing someone come from the back with the same dish you ordered. Also there's so many people in the back, I just wanna know why our food took so long. On top of this, I wasn't impressed with the food. The jackfruit pulled pork had way too much black pepper, and although I don't remember what pork taste like, I don't think this was it. I've had better jackfruit pulled pork sandwiches...But in the end I'm just happy no animals were harmed and veganism is being spread to the Bronx. \\u200d (FYI I have been vegetarian for 5.5 years and I usually cook my own food so...take that as you may)\",\n",

The staff is amazing and I loved that the owner came out and interacted with everyone that was there and ensured that we were happy with our food.

I came across Nana's kitchen under Mediterranean category and realized that it has mainly Albanian cuisine which is apparently very close to Turkish cuisine. They have Quofte like we have kofte, their suxhuk is same as our sucuk, they serve feta cheese along the salad, \\xa0their bread is like our pide, their rice pudding is like our sutlac, list goes on and on. So You get the picture of how similar it is.I was wondering if they could satisfy our high expectations, and ordered kofte plate for my husband with a combination plate( kofte and sucuk) for me. The delivery arrived within the time window.Wow and the kofte tasted amazing. It was well cooked, juicy and has very fulling portions. I didn't like the sucuk a lot- mainly it is me being picky here with the need for particular spices that I want to taste in the sucuk. I ordered baklava and rice pudding as a dessert. Baklava had pecans/chestnuts which I am kind of allergic but my husband liked it. (I like more the pistachio filled baklava- which I can try if they ever put in the menu) I tried the rice pudding: it was very mildly sweet and fresh. I am not a sweet tooth and it satisfied my need for something semi- sweet very well. Overall , The portions were just right. We felt full -not being overfull.Today we ordered again- kofte and quesdia with chicken this time. Again everything was delicious and very timely delivered.So I have all the reasons to love this place- good food, timely delivery and reasonable prices. I definitely recommend Nana's kitchen for those who want to taste good, authentic Albanian/Turkish food in the Bronx.\",\n",

They were very nice to have accommodated us, as we were a rather large group and hubby and I had a big stroller and baby in tow. The staff was very attentive and patient with us.I ordered their lobster bisque to start and was very disappointed. It was very thin, not as all like a thick bisque should be in consistency which made it unappetizing. It was also quite bland and I had to use a few salt shakes and pepper grinds to make it palatable.Hubby and I decided to order pizzas. I had a classic margherita and hubby had their piccante, with spicy salami, which neither of us enjoyed. The salami did not taste good at all.

The fried seafood would be around $20 but it's a big portion and it comes with fries. It's also not really seasoned but they give you salt and pepper on the side. The fries kind of suck cause it's on the soggier side but they are pretty thick pieces. If you're craving clam chowder or corn on the cob, they got that too!

I'm from the southern city on the water so I know goooood fried seafood and again.... this aint it. We had the shrimp $16, fish (whitening) $17, and the crab legs $25. They get points for portions of the fish and the crab legs. \\xa0The fish (1) was massive. Its not filleted so be prepared to chew on small bones- two ppl can definitely share it. The crab legs....so much to the point where it's questionable, you get a massive foil tray for only $25. There has to be at least 6-7 clusters of legs (Alaskan). You get melted butter, but go ahead and schedule your next dentist appointment if your snap game isn't good because there are no tools for the shell, its' not stone crab so you should be ok. You get maybe 10 shrimp in the baskets. Limp sad fries come with everything so be prepared to push that to the side. For me personally theres no flavor or seasoning in the batter so its just plain seafood...its not bad its just nothing to get excited over imo.The eating area inside is basic and the outside....... a mess. Pigeons hovering like vultures ready to snatch a free shrimp from your plate or hand and then fly off while pooping on someone else....yuck. They have some covered seating so if you are dying to sit outside - fight someone for a table. \\xa0They non seafood like burgers and have a 'bar' that sells premixed drinks like piña coladas.Parking is free, and theres an attendant to help direct you.....but its still a crowded littered mess, if possible, park elsewhere and just walk down to the restaurant. \\xa0Its cash only, but they have an ATM onsite....Good luck.\",\n",

The seafood skews heavily toward baskets of fried whatever (shrimp, calamari, haddock, what have you) and recalls the food stalls down at Coney Island. Eschewing the fried foods (with a tiny bit of food FoMo) I went with my tried-and-true New England Claim Chowder and Lobster Roll (x2 for the wife). The LR comes with fries that exceed expectations. There's a handful of beers on the cheap, too.Pay for your food/drinks at each station with cash money (come prepared), then sit down at one of the many metal picnic tables and enjoy the show: (1) weekend warriors doing tricks on jets skis for attention and (2) families happily ignoring the sign not to feed the seagulls, creating bird mayhem.Pro Tip: Don't wait pointlessly at one of the first stations when you enter.

He served the guests next to us, and pretty much ignored us. We had our menus closed and he never came to check on us. It was interesting because it wasn't very busy and he posted up across from us and kind of just stared in our direction, but never came to take our order. I admit some fault in this as we could have said something as well, but the situation was...awkward. It wasn't until my mom finally waved him over and asked why he never came back. He says he was waiting for us to be done. We clearly were, but ok.. We ordered fish and chips and empanadas. I've noticed that the price in food had went up, yet the quality was something to be desired. The fish and chips came out too fast to be deemed fresh, and it clearly tasted as though it was microwaved quickly and brought right out. The empanadas confused me as they came with soy sauce and had the consistency of dumplings? Yeah..they were dumplings. I noticed too late and it was confirmed when we got our bill and it said 'dumplings.' How they got dumplings from empanadas is beyond me. I also ordered a margarita.

It is very trendy compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. Prices are very fair.One of my gripes with Novelty Eats is that it can be inconsistent, especially when it comes to the milkshakes. You often have to ask them to make the shake thick or else it gets a little watery in terms of consistency. When they do get it right, no other shake can compare. Additionally, wait times can be excessive when the place is packed at night. A friend and I had to wait at least a half hour to get our order of milkshakes and mozzarella sticks.Some of the other food I have ordered at Novelty has been pretty average including the fries, mozzarella sticks, and the wraps. I ordered the Jasper Jones wrap once while with family. The wrap was so hot that I could not start eating it until everyone else had finished eating their meal. Nonetheless, I'll still be coming back for the burgers.\",\n",

I was torn between the chicken and the turkey burger, but after a few minutes of internal struggle settled on the chicken. I had 2 gripes with the burger, one of which was that the patty itself didn't have a ton of flavor, the other was that I had a few bites that included cartilage of sorts (think really unexpected bites into a hard piece of something). I also ordered the angel fries that were slightly mushy for me, but were on point flavor wise - which helped me look past the texture. Rounding out my order was the Oreo milkshake, which was solid but somehow they forgot to pack a straw. Separate from them, I \\xa0had an issue with Grubhub that didn't allow me to redeem an active offer they had, \\xa0$7 off of orders for new customers only. I mentioned it in my comments on the Grubhub order but never heard from anyone. I will be ordering from them again, still want to check out that Turkey burger, I'll update my review accordingly.PS the customer service here is phenomenal, shortly after I uploaded my review Steve reached out to me, thanking me and trying to make up for Grubhub's mistake.

For those who aren't from the area, City Island is very busy during the summer. Traffic can sometimes be really horrible on a nice day. Surprisingly, no traffic! The inside decor is modern and clean. It's not very large so if you're a large party I would suggest reservations just in case. Even though we dined during brunch we decided not to have any drinks. Because the prices seemed a little steep - I wasn't not expecting City prices. For entrees, we ordered the chicken and waffle and shrimp omelette with avocado. The chicken was tender but could have used more seasoning. The shrimp omelette wasn't great because the shrimp wasn't seasoned at all. I think adding even a little bit of salt and pepper would have gone a long way. The good part about the omelette was it did have a decent amount of shrimp wrapped inside. The service was good and I would visit again. Hopefully, next visit they add some seasoning.\",\n",

After spending these past four years living in the area, I make this claim with confidence, and I can say that Roberto's is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants.While on a special date with the woman I love, I was honestly shocked by how amazing the food was. The lamb she had practically fell off the bone. The ribeye I ordered was not only cooked to perfection, but was also paired with the most delicious sauce I may have ever had. Half was through the main course we asked for more bread to help us practically lick our plates clean. The food simple cannot be beat, and I am sure whatever you order will make you feel the same way.The only small caveat that keeps this restaurant from the 5-star review it likely deserves are the prices. The food was worth every penny, but when it comes to drinks, they quite frankly rip you off. After taking a look at he wine list, nothing is priced below $48. When attempting to order a bottle I know was good, they informed me it was out of stock so the waiter recommended the house cabernet. When it came to the table I was very happy as it was one of me and my girlfriend's favorite budget wines($10/bottle retail). When I received the check they charged a whopping $48 for it. I was expecting a decent markup, but to me, close to 500% seemed far too unreasonable.Nevertheless, I highly recommend Roberto's for some of the best food you will ever eat. Just watch out when ordering drinks!\",\n",

This is mainly due to the fact that there are at least four of them in the Bronx and whenever I\\'m out and about I seem to stumble upon one of them. Besides eating at their location near Arthur Ave years ago, I really had no experience with Estrellita\\'s offerings. My brothers and I were in the mood for Mexican the other night so we decided to head over here for some dinner. Located in the heart of Westchester Square, this Estrellita is decently sized. Walking in there\\'s a small dining area as well as the kitchen and pick-up counter for takeout orders. There\\'s another dining room to the right with more tables which makes it relatively spacious compared to their Arthur Ave spot. The aesthetics are casual - it\\'s not divey but also not as \"polished\" as a typical Mexican restaurant you would think of. It works though - and the Mexican music they have playing in the background adds to the feel. We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa - the chips were the thick kind which I appreciated and the salsa had the right amount of chunk. I went basic and chose tacos - they had a number of varieties and I noticed they had a deal where you can choose three for a fixed price. This seemed like the best bet - so I chose chicken, chorizo, and spicy pork. The tacos were good - nicely sized (3 of them were perfect for a dinner) and they didn\\'t skimp on the proteins. The spicy pork was my favorite, it had just the right amount of heat. The chicken was probably my least favorite - it had the least flavor and was a tad dry. I don\\'t fully blame Estrellita though, it was made with white meat chicken and I\\'ve had these types of tacos from other restaurants with similar experiences. Service was good, everyone was friendly and the food was served at a good pace. Overall, for a local Mexican spot Estrellita dishes out the goods. You won\\'t find a grand presence or mainstream things like strolling Mariachi players and sombreros here, but you will find friendly service and good, honest food. I would have no qualms about returning to this or any other of their locations.',\n",

Food: I got the shrimp scampi and it was just as bad, after 2 shrimps I had a bad after taste. I looked around to see if it was just me. I gave the 2 stars because the drinks were really good & the chocolate mints...

We were seated at a long table which was fines except for waiters continually bumping the folks at each end, and in a very loud area. The portions were huge (bordering ridiculous), but unfortunately, the food and service were super disappointing. It took over 35 minutes for our drinks to arrive after we ordered and even longer for food. When the food came, a steak ordered medium-rare came well done, and one ordered medium came as inedible overcooked. Lobster was overdone and not juicy and other shellfish was dried out. I think everything sat in the window for a long time, and our server disappeared and wasn't seen for over half an hour. Our lunch of appetizer salads and entrees ended up being over three and a half hours (12:35-4:15pm). Especially given the prices (that not seafood lover in your party really pays the price; $28 for chicken parm), it was really disappointing. I won't be back.\"},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I love the concept and decor inside. But poor execution probably will keep me from returning, unless I want to continue to lose my hearing. I was here for brunch. The DJ, while providing a great playlist mixing up old and new school Hip Hop/R&B, was way too loud for a restaurant setting. More like, a club or party volume level. It was impossible to have a conversation with your date/dining partner, let alone order food and drinks with your server without shouting and miming. Why? You can have music and a festive atmosphere at reasonable volume levels. Other reviews said the music was too low. Guess they fixed that!Brunch for 2, including unlimited mimosas, came to nearly $130 with gratuity included. \\xa0I guess they unfairly judged their potential clientele as bad or non tippers and figured let's just force everyone's hand, regardless if the service was good. Granted, we had avocado toast (bland and cold avocado spread) to start, and a shared side of Bacon (too greasy and very little hint of the candied flavor), but the food fell below expectations for the price paid. The rum cake french toast is really just a very dense rum cake browned in a pan. Not bad, but no need to get it again. Steak and Eggs were OK and tasty but cooked past the requested Medium doneness. Mimosas were kept topped off every time a staff member walked past us, so no complaints there. I might come back and give them a second chance. I do love supporting a small business but NYC has way too many established brunch choices to settle on mediocre food. If y'all are gonna charge Manhattan prices, then deliver on the food quality!\",\n",

The only base option for the salads is a mixed green. They don't have kale, spinach, or anything else. The salad was ok but everything was cold.

It would help expand the customer base. We also tried the hummus which the guy said was homemade. It is definitely homemade but the recipe needs some work. It was the texture of play-dough and had no seasoning. It was probably healthy but it needed a kick of seasoning. Back to the drawing board on this one.Overall, I do like what they are doing here.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! PLUS THEY CHARGE A 20% GRATUITY EVEN IF YOU'RE A PARTY OF 2 PEOPLE!Now that I have mentioned those key points I can begin with my detailed summary of my experience at the Sangria Cafe...We were seated by a nice greeter. However, after that it took a very long time for a waiter to greet us and take our order. Countless waiters would pass by our table and nobody paid attention to us. Finally, a server tended to us, but he was lousy. He did the bare minimum the entire time my husband and I were at the restaurant. He served us warm water without ice on a 90 degree day. And on top of that he accidentally poured a decent amount of that water on the floor and wet my foot, but he couldn't be bothered to mop it up creating a safety hazard for anyone who would walk by. We ordered the Churrasco with a side of sweet plantains and the Lomo Saltado dishes. The wait for the food was astronomical. In the meantime we ordered a lemonade. It tasted like a really cheap lemonade you get from the corner store or something. It was a horrible tasting lemonade. As we waited, 3 waiters bumped into me and my bag. If they aren't going to have hooks for the patron's purse (at the tables), then they should expect us to hang it off of our chair, and if that's the case they shouldn't bump into the bag! This was obviously very annoying. I eventually had to ask to be moved to one of the tables where one seat was part of a bench, that way I can put my purse on the bench and I could avoid this issue.Our food then finally came after God only knows how long (it felt like forever), my husband's food was cold (he got the Lomo Saltado) and mediocre tasting and looking. My food however, was not cold and tasted pretty good. But, my side of sweet plantains did not come along with my food. I had to ask for them twice after receiving my meal in order to get them to eat them along with the rest of my food. My sweet plantains were kind of cold and overpriced. I paid $5 for literally 5 tiny pieces of plantains. At other restaurants a side order of sweet plantains is $5, but I either get a little more than 5 pieces or they are decently sized and warm!Out of 3 sauces that came along with my steak, only one tasted good and that was the pico de gallo. The green chimichurri sauce had no flavor and the brown mystery sauce just tasted weird and bad.After eating what we could from our meals, all I wanted was a doggy bag (since my food wasn't bad tasting) and the check and even those things took a while for the employees to gather for us. When we finally saw the check, apparently although we were just a party of 2 the establishment charged a 20% gratuity fee, something that to me is unheard of for a party of 2 that consumed less than $100! I guess that this is how they ensure that their mediocre waiters get a tip despite the shoddy service!I would never go to this restaurant again. The wait to have our orders taken and for the fulfillment of our orders felt eternal and the staff did the bare minimum. Besides the fact that my husband couldn't enjoy his meal because it was cold and not very flavorful. I thought that this place could be a cool new and enjoyable restaurant because from the outside it looked attractive, but boy was I wrong.\",\n",

The oxtail was nicely seasoned! I only have 2 cons. One, they definitely need more waiters. Tracking our waiter, Victor who was very nice, seemed like mission impossible. Two, they need a better hostess with less attitude & who is more personable. Angela was very rude & nasty. She has NO people skills what so ever. Even the table next to me agreed.\",\n",

I ordered shrimp \"scampi\" w/ 2 sides - mashed potatoes and spinach. First, the food took forever! My shrimp \"scampi\" were disgusting. They were not scampi at all but in a weird tomato based sauce that were drowning the shrimp. No taste and definitely not scampi. My spinach was super salty. Basically inedible. And no mashed potatoes. They apparently ran out and I was given Mac and cheese instead. I was not told before hand, I would have chosen a different side. My friend ordered bbq chicken \\xa0and shrimp. She said her food was terrible. Like my food, drowned in a nasty sauce. She ate a few bites and completely stopped eating.

I feel like they do a really good job of sourcing really fresh ingredients. For example, I had some lettuce (arugula maybe) with burrata and sliced tomato and it was incredible. I think their bread also comes from a local bakery, it\\'s really great; their olive oil is delicious too. Their fresh pasta is made in house, it\\'s all really high quality and cooked al dente. As good as the pasta is, their sauces are all outstanding. Even pasta that doesn\\'t have \"sauce\" is amazing too (note the burrata on top of ravioli, and the cacio e pepe). They also make their own desserts! Their tiramisu was intensely creamy and by far the best I\\'ve ever had.

All I was thinking about was their rum punch and how many I can throw back (not many).I ordered the Jerk Chicken with the peas and rice. It was really good, very moist and not dried out. My rum punch was the best rum punch I ever had in the Bronx. Not too sweet and you can taste the Wray & Nephew rum. I'm so glad I wasn't the designated driver because we would have had to call an Uber.The wait staff was friendly and they look like they enjoy their job.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I decided to pay Fish N Ting a visit because it has been a while and I remember really enjoying the Ackee & Callaloo Egg Rolls (highly recommended...try with some jerk sauce on the side for your dipping pleasure!). While the placement of the restaurant is quite odd (it's located on a block of car dealerships), you feel like you have escaped the Bronx once you walk in the establishment particularly on the back patio area which has a fresh Caribbean vibe. Friendly staff also added to the experience!I ordered Brown Stew Red Snapper which was yummy! I really wanted to substitute the Rice & Peas for Mac & Cheese which was of equal value however, the staff was not budging on the substitution since they said the sides were viewed as free and I'd have to pay menu price for the Mac & Cheese. Considering, this meant that the Red Snapper was essentially $22 on its own, which is very pricey for a piece of fish. Be prepared for a bit of a wait since the food is 90% made to order.\",\n",

The entrance to the restaurant is unappealing but we entered and made our way outside towards the patio. The patio spot is gorgeous. I could def see it as a place to hang out during the summer months. I believe I had the oxtail rasta pasta. It was okay. There was SO much sauce which I did not expect. It made the dish unappetizing. Imagine oxtail sauce mixed with the cream from the pasta. Yuck! Also I ordered the calaloo spring rolls which were nice and different. I've never seen that before. My friend ordered the sweet and sour chicken which she did not like. We ordered a side order of plantain and only got 4 pieces for like $5. Ridiculous! Our waitress was also the bartender. Drinks were okay also.I felt the dishes were overpriced for the taste. Not worth it at all. If I do come again, I'll probably stick with the basics (rice and peas).\",\n",

We got:Roasted chicken legs and thighs - The flavor was fine and I liked the crisp on the chicken skin but the meat was way too dry. I could only eat it after pouring a lot of the bean water on it. \\xa02/5Braised oxtail with roasted eggplant - This was great. The eggplant is stewed into the oxtail sauce and gives it a unique flavor. 4/5Shredded skirt steak - I guess this is their version of carne ripiada (aka ropa vieja in Cuba). They went a bit overboard with the salt but eating it with the rice helps balance it a bit and brings out the flavor of the dish better. \\xa03/5I would come back here again to try some of their other stuff. \\xa0While I waited for my takeout, I noticed that the staff was pretty friendly and very accommodating.

He opted for a loaded baked potato (they accommodated it for him) and mac and cheese. For dessert we ordered a hot lava molten cake it came with ice cream. I ordered a Oreo cake.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"This place has a nice interior and a decent vibe. I went for lunch so I wasn't expecting anything extra special (and there wasn't) but there is something to be said about a clean, nice looking, handsome restaurant. If felt like a great place to not only get a bite to eat but to meet up with friends for a few drinks and good conversation. I had the house burger (HK Burger) and fries and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were pretty tasty, above average, I'd say. The burger wasn't as good. It looked pretty but it was a little dry -- the bread, the patty, and the extra brittle bacon served with it. Even a healthy douse of ketchup didn't right the wrong. The fries that came with the burger were crispy and had good flavor but were a little cold and the portion was stingy. That made me sad. Fortunately, the price was reasonable but I'm not sure I would have been any less satisfied with a cheaper McDonald's meal from across the street.Oh, parking is kinda problematic. It's only street parking with a two-hour time limit and very aggressive parking enforcement. I almost got a ticket... No, this restaurant didn't thrill me but, under the right circumstances, I'd give it another chance.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"HK caught my eye sometime last year while driving down East Tremont Ave. Its modern, brick facade and large floor-to-ceiling windows in the front is not typical of businesses in this area of the Bronx, so I was instantly intrigued. Even though I heard mixed things from my friends, I wanted to experience it for myself. One of my brothers and I were looking for lunch today so I thought it was a good opportunity to check it out. The aesthetics of HK is very modern and trendy. Walking in there's a large, round bar in the center and a combination of high-tops and regular tables around it. It has that industrial look to it - they're advertising themselves as a draft house so that kind of fits. \\xa0We were there on a Sunday around 2pm, as such they were offering brunch. I'm not sure what it included but I saw something in the ballpark of $34.95 which I wasn't looking to spend and thought I could do better off the traditional menu; we were looking for lunch anyway so it worked out. There was a DJ blasting music (I assume because of brunch) - lots of old stuff from the late 90s/early 2000s; I was instantly brought back to middle school dances. \\xa0Because we opted out of brunch, we were given a bar menu which only had some finger foods, a burger, and a sandwich. I know there's a more expansive menu since I've seen it online but there was enough for us on this menu so we just went with it. The menu had typical pub food - we both eyed the grilled chicken sandwich and decided to go with that. The sandwich was pretty good - in addition to the chicken there was lettuce, avocado, cheese, and an aioli on a club roll. The sandwich was pretty good - they were generous on the bacon which I appreciated, but the chicken breast was way too thin. The sandwich came with fries which were nice and crispy.Our server was super nice and the food came out at a good pace, and overall I enjoyed experience at HK. The restaurant lands at a 3.5 for me, but I'm rounding down because I didn't order off their full menu or try their beer. I was also a little surprised to see the place close to empty for brunch service since it's a pretty competitive meal these days. In any case, I didn't find any outstanding qualities that sets HK apart from its competitors, but I'll need to return before making a final assessment.\",\n",

My family and I tend to keep to the same items. For apps I've had: mussels, baked clams, coconut shrimp and calamari. So delish. Ive also had the stuffed mushrooms and I wouldnt get it again - water and lacked flavor. The bread and marinara oil is great \\xa0- they give it complimentary. We tend to ask for more. The pear salad is yummy. They use to GIVE you complimentary salad with \\xa0your entrees and they have stopped doing this. For both dine in and take out. I hate that. We usually get the spaghetti bolognese and penne al la vodka with shrimp or alone. Thats my GO to. I've tried a few other entrees as well.

Two shorter stools accommodate people waiting for their takeout. I'd suggest phoning ahead, that's what the locals seem to do.We decided to share an order of Thai Chili shrimp for an appetizer, and then we ordered two fried chicken dinners for the main course. Each of these dinners came with a choice of \\xa0two sides.My only gripe was with the wait - we were told 30, but it was more like 45 minutes, plan your parking accordingly. And yes the food was worth it. Heard Mingus' Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and some Coltrane while I waited, so that helped pass the time.The shrimp, seven in all, were of good size and the coating and heat level were quite similar to those coming from a good Thai restaurant. Underneath the shrimp, yellow rice - closest to an Indian pullao or maybe something Caribbean, and a lettuce salad. The shrimp did not make it home, devoured in our parking spot. A little tub of cole slaw as a lagniappe.The chicken portion comprised a drumstick and a split thigh. These must have come from a very large chicken - it was a big portion - but it was tender and well seasoned - crisp coating --just great fried chicken. Mustard greens were tender and savory, mac and cheese very rich, very tasty, and yams overly sweet for La Portena, but spot on for me. Vanilla scented. Dinner for 2 - $45 without beverages, with plenty left for another day. Great food, great value great music. The five star rating is spot on.\",\n",

We walked in and the man named Evan behind the counter offered to run down the entire menu with us after asking if this was our first time there. The man was training a new staff and was explaining to the new cashier the responsibilities. She was alright but forgot to give us utensils twice when she bagged our food. He was very patience and polite with her infront of everyone. The food was delicious and the man was open to feedback. He made sure to check up on how we were doing.I see a lot of potential for the business to grow if they can maintain this type of service and quality. From their detailed explanation most of their dishes are made in house and that's when you know they put heart into the food they make. I ordered the grilled chicken S. Indian bbq platter but tried my boyfriend's mixed one. Definitely get the grilled chicken and lamb platter because the lamb added an extra element to the dish. I also got the mac & cheese but I don't see what the hype was about. I do taste the sharpness of the cheddar but I've had better. I really wanted to try the fried chicken but it takes 30 mins because they make it fresh. They also ran out of homemade mustard green. My friends and I only stumbled upon this place because we were only passing through. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely get the fried chicken and mustard greens. Better yet try one item from every category and taste test the whole menu. What caught me off guard was the homemade fruit punch. It was yellow instead of red and it tasted like pina colada! Those thai chili shrimps are finger licking good. I never expected this type of service and delicious food from this small joint. Boy did it prove my expectations wrong.\",\n",

I needed to make a run to Old Navy that is on Fordham Road and is not listed on Yelp, (don't know why that is) but anyway decided to go check out the festival.Its a hit Yelpers! Oh my, there were all kinds of different venues. Its funny though that not alot of them were located in the BX., that being said it still was alot happening here. They had music playing, they had many variety of food options, they had sweet treats, they had different drinks and even accessories, from jewelry, to T-shirts, and skin care. It was nice to see that every one there was just enjoying the beautiful weather and nice vibes happening in the area. I saw families just sitting around lounging, (They had some tables and benches to sit at) eating their food or just talking and enjoying the music. Some people were getting up from their tables to dance to the good music they had playing for the event. It was just all good times happening on a nice summer night in The Bronx. If your in the area, or are a native of the Bx, I definitely say for you to go check it out. F.Y.I. - some venues do take cards, but I say just bring cash and a nice amount, cause you are bound to try more than one thing. - This night out runs from every Saturday (now) until October from 4p.m.-10p.m. -Come early, because some venues do sell out of their food/items.\",\n",

I remember well when this plaza got filled up with kiosks selling inexpensive what-have-you back in the day. But Night Market was so badly needed!!! When I heard about The Bronx Night Market back in 2018 from my friend Jason M., I wanted to jump on the bandwagon too and see The BX's well-known and only bustling Food market. It's filled with stalls selling all sorts of eats, Body Oils, Custom Jewelry and a few other things from almost all over the borough- (there was one NJ vendor though). Maybe it was towards the tail end of their season, but I had my sights on Mott Haven's Empanology- but they didn't participate the Saturday night we visited- I'll catch up to them in their restaurant. You'll find lots of vendors serving it up with a little bit of everything. Night Market has the Jerk spot, the Korean spot with Twisted Potato, Tacos and more- even a Vegan Bakery!!! Plus a table selling 'Bronx Night Market' merchandise which I picked up a $20 logo T-shirt. I'm digging what the Bronx Night Market founders created! So if your destination is to only come to Fordham- for The Botanical Garden and The Bronx Zoo, try also coming to Bronx Night Market between May-October on any given Saturday to have a chill time. The BX never ceases to amaze me. Kudos to you guys!\",\n",

I have to say the level of culinary arts at this restaurant is inconsistent at best. I've ordered from them About a handful of times. Each time, the quality is worse than the last. This time, I ordered pad Thai-of course with a Thai tea. The noodles were almost white, clearly not coated well in any spice that would resemble Thai seasonings. It was tasteless. And they have the nerve to charge more than other Thai restaurants in manhattan. I also asked for my tea without ice. And guess what folks... ding ding ding... the cup is full of ice. I'm glad I was able to experience at least one time where they were performing optimally. I'm not ordering from here again. If you're reading this would advise you not to start ordering from them. It's a waste of money. Your taste buds deserve better.\",\n",

I ordered vegetable steamed dumplings and chicken Drunken Noodles. Both dishes were mushy and lacked flavor. The dumplings were wet and very soggy with no flavor. The soy sauce that came with the dumplings was watered down. The Drunken Noodles were better than the dumplings, but both with equally bad in flavor. I would never eat here again.',\n",

However I ordered the exact same thing the second day and I can assure you there was not a single crumb left on my plate. Their omelette and house potatoes are everything!!! Our last day there, I had to test out the pastrami croissants of course! Needless to say, I was a happy camper with a full belly & a cream cheese puff to go! What's up?! Can't get better than that.

I reached out to them via Instagram just to make sure that the restaurant was \"newborn\" friendly since I\\'ve just given birth. After some convo they were nice enough to situate us in the backroom where it would be more kid friendly since the first half of the restaurant a lot of customers were ordering hookah. From then on the service was on point. The management was awesome and super friendly (Thanks Jeanie), the wait staff was attentive, always checking in on us, the food was amazing!

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'With all of the positive reviews CASA has I didn\\'t think I would have a bad experience BUT I was wrong....Came here on a Friday evening. Apparently our waitress was taking care of the entire restaurant. She came over to take our drink orders... my friend asked her what a Bombay Ginito is *a drink on their HH menu* and she replies \"ummmm I really don\\'t know\". So we all go with the Malibu Mojito (whewww the drink taste like carbonated water with lemon juice & no alcohol). When another person came over to check on us we mentioned the lack of alcohol and he was nice enough to bring us shots to add to the drinks). \\xa0For apps we had guava bbq wings & sweet chili wings. A server brought out the wings without plates so we ask our waitress for them and she says to tell the server (I\\'ve never heard of such nonsense, it must of been written all over my face because she quickly said she\\'ll tell him). The wings were equally good, the sweet chili having a serious kick. Our waitress comes back to take the rest of our orders. We had Salmon *overcooked*, Tequila Lime Shrimp *flavors were off*, Calamari *salty*, Lobster & Crab Mac & cheese *imitation crab, no flavor*, Mofongo *just ok*. In the midst of eating another person came over to check on us so I asked him what the Bombay Ginito & Martell Sidecar are and he didn\\'t know either. But he was nice enough to check with someone else who did. The waitstaffs lack of knowledge is really a reflection of management so I do not blame the waitstaff. That plus the lack luster food and automatic gratuity will keep me from returning here.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'This is a local place, where if you are ok with subpar food AND VERY LOUD MUSIC, then you will like it. I ordered skirt steak with lime rice - the steak was fine, the rice was gross. My daughter ordered a shrimp dish, and while she loves shrimp - she ate 3 of them and left the rest of the food. The waiter asked us if we wanted to take the rest home, she told him \"no thank you\". The music was great!! The drinks are so watered down, not even funny. I ordered a pitcher of mojitos, no sugar cane and I couldn\\'t taste the rum or mint or quite frankly anything AT ALL, the entire drink was meh, and they give you plastic cups and plastic straws \\xa0- WHY? Everyone else had glass drinks. I would go back, sit at the bar, listen to great music and drink water.Also keep in mind that they automatically add a 20% gratuity, no matter how people are at a table. Usually that is reserved for a large group - but not here. If you order hookah- you have to pay cash and if you expecting change from the hookah man - forget it - he keeps it as his \"tip\" whether or not you wanted to give him one.If you want decent food and do not want to go to Havana Cafe, go next door to HK Restaurant.',\n",

So we sit down and we order and notice there\\'s no utensils. That\\'s fine, we haven\\'t even ordered. I ordered a lobster roll with a side of Mac and cheese, my friend ordered a veggie burger and my boyfriend got a Mac and cheese. A few minutes later the waitress comes out and tells me they were out of Lobster. Okay, sucks but alright. So I ask for my side to be my entree. We\\'re waiting for a while and food comes out. I have two Mac and cheeses, my friend\\'s burger has cheese, and we have no utensils. I think perhaps I was wrong. The waitress apologized and offered to comp the Mac and cheese and the street corn. Awesome! I didn\\'t even say anything about comping the order. I was a lot more concerned about my friend, especially because the waitress had read back exactly what they ordered. At this point we were debating about leaving but the food was already on the table. The big reason we stayed was because of the comped food. We also still had no utensils. Overall the food was solidly meh. But the service could use an improvement. To be clear they tried but no utensils and no condiments on the table is just basic service. My friend had to ask for napkins three times, ask for their initial order of Pepsi three times, and when I asked for hot sauce, my waitress asked \"other hot sauce?\" When we didn\\'t have hot sauce on the table. I answered \"there is no hot sauce here\" Honestly I wouldn\\'t come back. My boyfriend is now gloating that he was right about New American restaurants the whole time.',\n",

The two guys working the front were extremely friendly and welcoming from the start. My party ordered two sandwiches, the chicken viona and pork Milanese, fries and the small burrito salad. I looooved the chicken viona sandwich, probably the best chicken sandwich I've had in a very long time. The fries are great, too.What I appreciated most about this place is how rustic and relaxed the ambiance was. I loved the little details of decoration all around and how they served drinks in plastic cups but had mason jars to hold your silverware and flowers, it just worked. Lastly, I appreciated how friendly they were to our party due to it being almost closing time. My party ate quickly because we understood but also we did not feel rushed whatsoever. Great place.

I've visited twice, the first time with girlfriends after a run in the park. It was happy hour and we all shared some guac, shrimp tacos which were AWESOME and a couple reasonably priced drinks. My second time was a few days later when I treated hubby to a boozy brunch for his birthday. AYCD is an extra $20 which gives you 2 hours of your choice of brunch beverage. Their brunch menu is nice. We started off with their Korean BBQ wings which were sooo tasty, and we also tried their French Onion Soup Dumplings which were cute little dumplings filled with onion soup and covered in a blanket of melted cheese. My son and I both ordered their Salmon Benedict which I didn't too much care for, only because I didn't taste the smoked salmon that much but my sine liked it. Hubby had their breakfast burger and he loved it. I definitely want to come back for happy hour again. It's great because I often jog down to the park with my daughter for a workout and some park play so stopping by for a quick bite and a drink before heading home would be super convenient. On both occasions, the staff has been so very pleasant and helpful, even when baby girl put the kung fu grip on hubby's drink and caused a cascade all over our table. For brunch, we tried their French Onion Soup Dumplings,\",\n",

There\\'s lots of seats inside but it\\'s still definitely busy. The service was decent. I feel like our server barely checked up on us so it took a while to order extra things or just to get refills on drinks. I also don\\'t think we got all of our side orders with our entrees. It was only when I asked the server if it comes with corn, for example, that he would bring it over.For appetizers, I usually get new england clam chowder and fried calamari. The clam chowder isn\\'t the best but still tasty. The fried calamari is definitely different than other places. It has a breading that is similar to the breading of mozzarella sticks. I got fried shrimp and a whole red snapper which came with fries. The fries were realllyyyy good. It was crispy, seasoned well and pretty thick. The red snapper was fishier than I had liked and wasn\\'t seasoned that well. The fried shrimp was also decent so I didn\\'t really find that entree worth it.I always go for the \"feasts for 2\" and the portions are HUGE! They definitely serve more than 2 people. The staff says that it is good for 4-5 people, but I think it can feed up 8 people! They also serve bread and cold veggies which are alright. I have tried the Italian Feast and the Paella from the feasts for 2 and they take a while to come to the table but they are soooo filling. It\\'s stuffed with all types of seafood and definitely a hands on meal so expect to get messy. The seafood in the Italian feast actually wasn\\'t as good as I liked. The crab legs were really hard to break apart; the shells were already softened but it just wouldn\\'t break. The mussels and lobster was also kind of small and didn\\'t have a lot of meat.Overall, I think that the Sammy\\'s chain is great for big parties and sharing the feasts! It\\'s super filling and almost guaranteed to have leftovers.',\n",

Water often went without being refilled and the table could've been cleaned off faster (salads and appetizer plates).Food was bland and was not seasoned well. If it wasn't for the tartar sauce or sauce tray my fish and shrimp would have been lifeless. Fiancés salmon seemed to be seared in straight butter or grease but no other flavor at all.

The setting and decor was simple; old-school but clean. It has a good number of sitting booths, as well as the usual variety of tables and chairs. I ordered a cup of coffee; which I found it that it tasted odd. I also ordered the Hungry Woman breakfast special. It consisted of French toast, ham, sausage, bacon and eggs any style. I requested turkey ham, sausage and bacon. The eggs were fried, sunny side up. Each egg had a slice of cooked ham underneath. I noticed that the yolks were a little undercooked. Sadly, that was the first turnoff moment I had. I said to myself, no problem. I simply scraped the raw egg yolks off to the edge of the plate. However, the meat products were extremely salty to my taste. The ham was the saltiest of all. I tried eating a piece of French toast with maple syrup, along with a piece of the meat products. The combination was too much. I simply took two bites of each item. I ended up eating the cooked portions of the eggs, and most of the French toast. That was the best thing I had out of the breakfast combo. I regret not having some cinnamon to sprinkle on top. I would definitely come back to this restaurant, maybe for some pancakes with a fresh fruit topping. Overall, the decor and service were amazing.\",\n",

It was not our favorite and probably we liked more softer texture. Service was a little slow and it was hard to get a waitress to order or get the bill. Once you get her attention, everything was fine. It is not fancy place, but a great to hang out if you are searching for a great meal without breaking the bank.',\n",

Once I saw her give a neighborhood kid some cookies from the display case because he came to say hello to her. Another time, a man who probably did not have money to pay just ran out of the shop with his food without paying. She did not say a bad word or got upset. I respect her for doing that because no one knows another man's \\xa0problem unless one walks in his shoes. If he could run away without paying, he must be going through something in his life. Onward with the food, the food is very tasty. I do expect that from a Trinie. She looks like a Guyanese though. \\xa0My favorite is their rotis...any one of them. The doubles are very good as well. I sometimes would get the buss up shut to go so I could have them with my own curry at home. I wish her longevity!\",\n",

I also asked if they had salmon red curry and they confirmed this as well. However when we arrived we found out that they don't use salmon to make the red curry.

Because we've come here so many times I've had the opportunity to try quite a few different things on the menu.Fried Calamari: 3/5 (Hit or miss, usually just alright)Wings: 5/5 (They give a huge portion, the BBQ, Mild, and buffalo sauces are all great)Caesar Salad: 5/5 (You might think it's hard to mess this up, but I've had some pretty sh*tty Caesar salads but from here they're always good)Coconut Shrimp: 4/5 (The shrimp are always fantastic but sometimes the sauce they're served with can be really watered down)New England Clam Chowder: 3/5 (Sometimes the soup of the day, not something I'd order often because it's really nothing too spectacular)Buffalo Chicken Wrap: 4/5 (Always a solid choice but sometimes when ordered with grilled chicken the meat is very dry, go with breaded)Fries: 4/5 (Standard steak fries, delicious)Wolf House Burger: 4/5 (If you're in the mood for a good burger this will take care of your craving)AND THE BEST FOR LAST ****Drumroll****Buffalo Chicken Quesadilla: 10/5 (Kind of a hidden gem on the menu but this thing is my personal favorite and I come here solely to get it. Always great, it's a big portion & always delicious-Highly recommend if you're a buffalo fan)Overall the wicked wolf is a great option for any craving and because of the extensive menu it's good for a lot of different occasions. You're served a little bread basket when you sit and it's a good vibe and ambience in the restaurant and at the bar. The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because usually the service is pretty slow & the food takes a while to come out. BUT when it does it makes up for the wait.\",\n",

So my friend and I got super lucky cuz we got there around 11:50am not realizing he had already packed up to go to his Manhattan location, but he still was super nice and fixed us up a few platters on the spot. He also hooked us up with a few free pieces for free while we waited for him to chop up the pork on the back of his pickup truck. Pork and rice +/- plantain =$10Pork, rice, octopus salad = $15The lechon was juicy and tasty. The skin was crisp and fatty and salty and you know it's not good for you but you don't care cuz it's delicious. My friend who has had lots of lechon said it's one of the best he's had. The octopus salad was great too. The olive-ness and acidity helps even out the fat.\",\n",

Angel was just setting up the empanadas .The lechon wouldn't be ready until 12. Angel made us a few empanadas to hold us over and we began talking. What a genuinely great guy. He was nice enough to take us over to where he cooked the lechon also which was a sight to see. I ordered a plate with fresh lechon with rice, the lechon has crispy skin and was super moist.

I don't know what the other reviewers are smoking but definitely not the best.I found the pork to be quite bland and left me with one note. I wish that the pork was seasoned better because it would have taken it to new heights. Had to add a bunch of garlic and homemade hot sauce to mine. Also the octopus salad was room temperature and it needed some acid and more lime. However there empanada was good.I wouldn't come back again personally however it's an experience in itself and worth trying out once. Great guy\",\n",

I had blindly followed our party leader to the nearby Mamajuana Cafe a few blocks away. After a long, physically, demanding night of mixing it up with the locals, we decided to make our way home, having accomplished the mission in celebratory fashion. Everyone else requested Uber Evac and something like three of them dusted off with most of the party. I made certain that the last damsel boarded the final transport out and then I proceeded to make my way on foot. I had hoped to catch the 04:16 No. 6 Locomotive out of the area. I could see the trestles when I saw unfortunately I saw the locomotive pull into the station. I knew I was going to miss it and that meant I had to hunker down for at least an hour. Fortunately, I saw the light on at a small establishment on the side of the road, Tremont Diner. I ordered an omelet with jalapenos and silver dollar pancakes with strawberries. The food was quite savory and sweet respectively. The patron and staff treated me well and moved with efficiency. The respite rejuvenated me and I felt ready to continue my journey home. Belly filled, I once again ventured out into the night to catch the next locomotive hoping not to run into any hostiles. Luck was on my side and I made it back to Brooklyn by sunrise. I write to you to let you know that I am safe and will soon be in your arms. I've told my comrades about Tremont Diner with the hopes that they can find it if ever they find themselves in that territory. Love,Your favorite Brookynite\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I came here today with my girlfriend after our morning run. We made up for all our burned calories with a couple omelets, turkey sausage and pancakes that we shared. She had the Mexican omelet with tomatoes, onions and jalapeños. It was tasty and spicy but I would have liked some monterrey jack cheese in it. I had the spinach and feta omelet and added some mushrooms. It was nice and the feta was not too overpowering. Each of our omelets came with hash browns and toast, which we both subbed for English muffins. We also shared an order of pancakes with turkey sausage. That dish was not the best that I've had at a diner, as simple as it is. The pancakes are good but whatever syrup they use tastes wrong, like it was sugar-free or something. It completely ruined my pancake so I left it alone. The turkey sausages were a little too watery and the hash browns with my omelet were seasoned well but dry AF ans could have used some chopped onion and peppers like I've had at other places.On the upside, the service is really good. As soon as we sat our server came to offer drinks and take our order. They came often to refill my tea and my girlfriend's coffee and to see if we needed anything.I ordered some sandos for the boys, a Philly cheesesteak with curly fries for my son and a turkey triple decker with classic fries for hubby. Hubby liked his sandwich but my son gave a 3/5 for his. Both meals came with a choice of soup which was nice but the price tag for just the sandwiches was over 30 bucks; kind of insane for a diner.I came here a long time ago with my husband and never reviewed but we don't come often because it's very out of the way from where we live. We were likely visit his family who lives in the area. I don't really care for diners unless I or someone I'm with has gone to one before and can vouch for it. I likely won't be back here.\",\n",

They have the only pizza shop that I have been to where the toppings are coming out of the oven dehydrated. It is a mystery to me how it is that they can get there chicken on there slices so juicy.It is always packed in here so you know its good and the turnover of the pies.They are far from the cheapest slices and pies. It will cost you a pretty penny, but it is worth it. This is one of those places where the mantra \"You get what you pay for for is true.\"The staff is always nice and accommodating.

Despite this, I have seldom dined here besides the occasional holiday meal. That's what bought me to my latest dining experience, when my family decided to grab dinner here for Easter. Pasta Pasta is situated in a small strip mall on Williamsbridge Rd, but since it's in the corner unit it has a decent entryway and a good amount of space on the inside. It's not the largest restaurant but they have an open dining area with a small private room to the side. The decor is a bit dated and tired, but there are huge windows that line the front of the restaurant that makes the entire space bright.The menu is typical of other neighborhood Italian restaurants, though they have a pretty big selection which was nice to see. For the Easter holiday they had a number of specials in addition to giving us the option to order from the menu. We started with some hot and cold antipasto, fried calamari, and fried zucchini. Everything was pretty good - it wasn't the best antipasto I've had, but I did enjoy the fried calamari; I applaud them for having rings *and* legs. For my main I had the lasagna. The dish looked substantial and amazing, but unfortunately the flavor fell short for me. The meat and sauce were a little bland, and the pasta was over-cooked. Service was good, holidays are rough but they were super attentive. Overall, I feel that Pasta Pasta kind of suffers from being a warm body - it's been around for many years and it doesn't seem like much has changed.

It was a great, chill experience, with good vibes. As soon as I walked in, the employees were very welcoming and friendly. The servers each greeted my husband and I. So we definitely started on the right foot. And the great part was that this behavior was consistent throughout our time in the establishment. The servers were very attentive and were willing to answer any and all our questions about items on the menu.I ordered the Sambal Twist Chicken and Waffles and a Virgin Orange Sherbet Mimosa. The Chicken and Waffles were absolutely delicious and unique! I would've never imagined that curry sauce and jalapeños would taste good with chicken and waffles, but it definitely did! The chicken was fried perfectly, both pieces were juicy and had plenty of meat. Although the description of the dish initially was a little intimidating, the flavors all complimented each other well and was enjoyable. As for my drink, despite it not having alcohol I thought that it was good. I also was able to taste the Frosé Lemonade and I really enjoyed that as well. It was a nice and light drink. I was worried that it would pretty much be a slushee, but it wasn't and that is why I liked it.I ended up being glad that I couldn't get into Beatstro, because I doubt that I would've had such a lovely time there as I did at iNINE Bistro.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Happy Anniversary to us! My hubby decided to take me out for breakfast instead of dinner this year. After 11yrs, it was fine by me, as long as we were together. I decided to choose something local, not to far from where we live, we even found street parking with no issues in such a crazy busy area. We are New Yorkers so we knew what to expect and what to do if we didn't find any street parking and thats to pay for a garage. It wouldn't have been for long anyway. Now to Terravita.It's not really a huge place, but just the right size for some intimate dining. The decor of the place is beautiful, and still very stylish for it to also be a casual spot as well. We were greeted by warm smiles and was told we could sit anywhere we like, (of course my hubby wanted to stay in front so he could see his car from up close.) We were offer water and right away my husband ordered some coffee. We decided to go with an appetizer while we waited for our food. That turned out to be an excellent idea, because the crab cakes we order were BOOM! The Bomb! They were so meaty and crisp on the outside served with a lil light refreshing salad of cucumber and fennel. They didn't have a fishy taste to them, or tasted as if they were frozen or came from a can. They were really a mouth full of flaky goodness. Then we got the French Toast served with fresh fruits and a side of creme fraiche, and my husband found that to be so good he wanted to ask the chef for the recipe so I could cook it on a daily basis lol. That bread was moist and super tasty, I couldn't even finish mines because of the large amount it was. My husband took that right off my hands to eat it himself. The bacon we ordered with it was also delicious. I was so pleased to receive complimentary bellinis on the house because we were celebrating our wedding anniversary, and on top of that such excellent service altogether we decided we would definitely have to do another return. My husband just couldn't stop talking about the Toast. Terravita definitely has found a new happy customer, and I can't wait to return for their Happy Hour and Brunch options. Our waiter let me know they have Jazz and wine tasting on Thursday evening, so look out for that review as well. If you're in the area I definitely say check this place out.\",\n",

Transition was brutal AF but we love the neighborhood whole heartily. If ya know me the first thing I did when I moved in was scope out good eats. So far, so good...We visited Terra Vita , Dominican - American restaurant on the edge of the heights, by the GWB. You won't get a tres golpes fix but the restaurant specializes in a fusion of Dominican and American cuisine all with trendy, modern flare. I ordered the Terra Vita burger, medium rare which came between two large tostones, cheese, caramelized onions and lettuce with a side of yucca fries. So good. A lot of people ask me where can they find good Dominican food and I would always respond my mom's place up until today.

It is light and delicious but also a small portion so I left a little hungry honestly. If you dont order it with protein it may not be enough for lunch. My partner ordered the quinoa salad with salmon and enjoyed it too. It is a little on the pricier side than other restaurants in the neighborhood but that doesn't take away from the fact you get good quality food here. \\xa0Service is pretty good too and they have wifi which is always a positive.

But today I was so disappointed,,, the flavor is good but the fat and purple skin is not removed. It's boiled and just cut up. In the past the pulpo is nice and clean. All you get is white meat and lots of good flavor. We spoke to manager who did discount our bill and mentioned that's the new way they are doing it. Hopefully they will go back to the way it was made.I do love this place\",\n",

The view was fantastic, but unfortunately the service was far from it. It took us quite a while to even get menus and then even as our food was served it would take a few minutes after for our waitress to bring utensils out after. I figured the wait times would be kind of long given the disclaimer on the menu that it was possible since everything is made from scratch, but even given that the wait times felt excessive. As for the food we started with the clams oreganata, which tasted very good. It had the perfect amount of bread crumbs and the lemon went well with the clams. As for my entree the salmon was okay, not particularly flavorful and the size was reasonable. The lemony garlic sauce salvaged the meal and tasted great.

I'm not sure of the name of the meal that I ordered, but was excited to try it - the food smelled amazing! I made sure to add the garlic sauce on top. I didn't have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy my meal since I had a flight to catch, so I had to carry my meal in a plastic bag. I regret not holding my meal upright because I believe this caused the garlic sauce to leak from the container. Once I finally got to the airport, I had the opportunity to try the food. It was decent, definitely not mind blowing. \\xa0I'd say it was somewhat bland in nature, and some of the pork had of inedible fat. I think it would have been more satisfying with some sauce n' seasoning. I think the leakage definitely contributed to the lack of flavor/ extra oomph.

That's all cute and dandy, but the shellfish was now cold while His Slowness crawled to the kitchen to pick up the rest of the meal, and then bring it to our table. \\xa0The shellfish initially came out warm, and now it was just cold...not good!For $80, the king crab legs were a bit too few. \\xa0They were large and meaty, and cooked well, but there just wasn't that many of them. \\xa0The lobster was also cooked well, but could've used more seasoning throughout the whole thing instead of just in the middle. \\xa0The baked potatoes were not good AT ALL. \\xa0They were cooked in too hot an over for too short a time causing the skin to burn and the inside to stay hard in the middle. \\xa0That was really disappointing. \\xa0Not only do I really enjoy a good baked potato with butter, but they are so incredibly easy to make and we like to eat the skin. \\xa0The linguine in white sauce was really good although the missing grated cheese would've made it that much better, but it was a very nice surprise indeed. \\xa0I would venture to say it was the best part of this overpriced and very disheartening meal. \\xa0For all that money, I really wanted to love it and that just didn't happen :(\",\n",

Granted, we ourselves had a great time cause you know, half decent wine and good company always covers up all the dumb, dumb flaws. Shrimp Dynamite? Trying to jump on the played out Bang, Bang Shrimp wagon you say? Bangin'? Dynamite? They certainly were neither. What they should be named is Fried Shrimp. Geez! We didn't feel like fiddling with lobster crackers and bibs and working for our food. So the broiled, tad over fired tails had no choice but to do the job and sufferingly, satiated our lobster cravings. Yeah, I know gluttons for punishment. Won't be making that mistake again. \\xa0The Crab Lobster Stuffing, what I really came for was nothing at all how I remembered it. The cuts on the veggies were big chunks and not even sautéed through, creating a chunky veggie stuffing with soft breaded texture and hardly any crab or lobster. What a disappointment!Our server on the other hand, was very attentive and was a plus, adding a plus to this our last experience at Lobster Box. \\xa0I get the, 'if it ain't broke don't fix it', and some people still love this place. But come on CI, stop it with the exorbitant prices, lack luster food and one note restaurants. Every restaurant on the strip, with the exception of a very small few are a Johnny's Reef under a different name.

The only restaurant I know of in City Island is Sammy's so, when my boyfriend offered to take me out to another restaurant in the area, I was excited. We visited Tony's Pier on a Saturday, early evening. Its located at the very end of the strip overlooking the pier. Parking isn't too bad and there is both indoor and outdoor seating. This is a casual dining restaurant (think of mcdonald's), so do not expect anything fancy. The menu is basic and features seafood (mostly fish, shrimp, lobster tails, etc.), chicken, and sides (e.g., fries, onion rings, etc.). They offer both fried and steamed options. Alcohol also available for purchase. Pricing is reasonable given that its all fresh seafood however, its CASH ONLY. Upon entering, we were a little confused as there are multiple lines. One line is for fried, another for steamed, then another for drinks. Overkill. There was someone to direct you at times but its still a lot of lines, almost as if you in a theme park. The wait time thankfully, was not long. We ordered the fried shrimp with a side of french fries and a side of whiting fish. The shrimp and fries were pretty good, needed a little more seasoning but still edible. The tartar sauce \\xa0also could've used a little pizzaz, but it did the job. The whiting fish however, was bland. It tasted as if they just cleaned it and fried it, no salt or anything for taste, so disappointing. Overall, its a nice place to visit for a casual date or family night out, keep your expectations calm. I would return in the future.\",\n",

We went early Sunday, as soon as they opened so it was as busy but in an hour or so it became busy. We got lucky to not wait too long for food.The side options are limited. Most dinners all come with French fries so if you want something else you'll need to order it. My broil lobster was so juicy it was totally worth the extra few minute wait.

I just settled on Yuca with Onions. Honestly, I'm so damn picky about Cod Fish Fritters- I can't eat them from just anybody. Plus Puerto Rican and Dominican ways of Cooking and Seasonings- differ quite a bit. According to hubby, one bite of the Morcilla- threw him off and trashed the entire thing, the Cod Fish Fritter- was just like I imagined and still drenching in oil- ewwww. Yuca? Well...you can't mess up boiled Root Vegetables with Onions in Vinegar and Oil (can you?). Even my Passion Fruit Juice was watered down. Why??? Good try. But nahhh.

It's literally touching and everything is home made and what's another for fresh? Hmm whatever that is it's 100% better than that. The fiancée and myself don't eat pork so Nook has it clearly posted that they don't use pork in any of their dishes. The father and son were just so nice but tbt star of this business is the Mom who worked in a bakery for 20 years and took a leap of faith to open her own business. I wish her and the family much success bc this good is beyond good.Try the walnut French toast which literally had walnuts in every bite. The beef bacon is OMG OMG OMG good. I was so nervous that I was eating pork bc my Spidey senses was completely loving the bacon. I wish I could have taken more back to the hotel. I don't typically warm up leftover breakfast but I did on the French Toast. The fiancée had the pancakes which were light and fluffy just perfection.

A slightly hidden gem, I say slightly because it's well known by those whom had the opportunity to visit but not by everyone else. They are also on the park department's website and have their own site. So Wave Hill is not exactly hiding. Lol. I must admit I've learned of this beautiful gem some time ago and just never ventured over. Unless you leave in the vicinity of the Riverdale area I must forewarn you it can be quite a bit of a trek, especially if you don't drive. However, I will go as far to say that is part of this park's beauty, romance and allure. Perfect for families (even the little ones), friends and couples. WaveHill feels like the door to a portal, where everything is green, lush, and peaceful. With amazing views of the river, the bridge and wonderfully blooming flowers in Spring & Summer and great changes of foliage colors in the Fall. Wave Hill is of course is on a smaller scale then the famed Central Park or the notable Botanical Gardens but by no means do you miss out on any of nature's wonder. This park offers visitors, a green house, garden house and a plethora activities and events for everyone. On the day of my visit there were a group of yogis in their bliss on one of the main lawns. There is also seating throughout the grounds, gray wood crafted seats for you to just relax and enjoy your own personal serenity if you so choose. You can become a member or pay as you go, however there are many things you can access for free. The park has a parking lot which I believe is at a cost of $8 dollars and be aware it is small so it fills up quickly. As alternative there is a shuttle you can take to avoid the congestion or the search for a spot. I strongly recommend you visit their site to see and learn all of what Wave Hill has to offer.Just A Note: You are allowed to bring food & snacks but signs say no picnicking. So be modest and don't bring Boo Boo and your picnic baskets.\",\n",

Highly recommended! Great food and good service. Good times! Overall rating: A++***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*** Three friends and I came here on Sunday at 12:30pm for brunch. Many free parking spots on the street that day. My friend called and made us a reservation for brunch a few weeks in advance. Brunch is served as an all-you-can-eat buffet. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee for just $22.95 plus tax and tip! What a bargain! Mimosas are $5 each extra. There is a staffed omelet station in the back sometimes but I didn't use it. We sat in the back patio and it was very nice. I wish there were more umbrellas and some of the chairs were more comfortable though. It seems like most of the customers were sitting on the patio. So come early if you want to get a nice shady spot out on the patio. I barely saw any people inside unless they were waiting on the line to get food from the buffet. Service was very good they came by to check on us often. The problem is you need to make sure you don't overeat. When I was there at the hot stations, I saw they had bacon, sausage, kind of dry and burned French toast, bread pudding(?) with raspberry sauce, slightly burned pancakes, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, gross corned beef hash(?), and weirdly sweet and hot sausages and peppers. Later on they replaced the sausage and peppers with fried chicken, which was a much better option. At the cold station they had various fruits, yogurts, grilled vegetables, mini creme brulees, flan, cinnamon buns, and bagels. My favorites were the bacon, pancakes, fried chicken, bread pudding, and watermelon. I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of items since there was such a big variety! It ended up being about $34 per person (including brunch and one mimosa for each person) after tax and tip.I really like that this place is nice and cozy without being too noisy/crowded. It is a great place to come and catch up with friends! There are two unisex bathrooms right before you get to the patio. They're very small though. All in all everyone had a great time. We had our fill of delicious foods as well as tasty mimosas. I would definitely return here in the future for brunch!

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'It makes me sad to write a negative review of this popular City Island institution. It\\'s part of the community\\'s fabric and I know that so many Bronx locals and tourists come here for special occasions and family gatherings. HOWEVER, for as much as this restaurant overcharges for mediocre, frozen--and I might even go as far as saying imitation--seafood, it deserves to be called out. (Note: This review does not reflect the service. I was very happy with the service we received.) Here\\'s my experience in a nutshell if you don\\'t feel like reading the full review: We finished only half of the appetizer (couldn\\'t stomach the imitation or frozen calamari), then, after taking a few bites of our equally imitation or frozen main course (conch salads), politely sent the dishes back and asked for the check. Yes, it was that bad. (I\\'ve never sent food back at a restaurant.)The full experience:My hubby and I went on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer ($17.95) and Cold Scungilli (conch) Salads ($21.95 each). Let\\'s first talk about the calamari. At $17.95, one would expect crispy, FRESH, well-seasoned squid with an equally delicious (and special) sauce. What we got was either frozen or (more likely) imitation squid. How do I know? Every ring was the same shape and size (natural squid varies in size when cut up), there were no tentacle pieces and the consistency was that of crabstick, which is a totally processed imitation crab made of leftover pressed fish parts. The crazy thing is, even the worst food can taste good when given a good fry, right? Not in this case. The fry was soggy, not well seasoned (Red Lobster probably seasons its fried food better), and the red dipping sauce was like a basic, straight-out-of-a-jar variety.Also, here\\'s some context on price for quality. Oceana, one of Manhattan\\'s top seafood restaurants, charges $19 for a fried calamari appetizer. Read: \"Manhattan\\'s TOP seafood restaurants.\"Their calamari is fresh, flavorful, crispy and comes with a very special dipping sauce (not what tastes like straight out of a can). The Scungilli (conch) Salads at $21.95. The salad itself was large and the amount of conch on it was very generous. The conch itself, I\\'m guessing was also frozen, though, because it had that watery consistency that comes from being defrosted. Also, it lacked that certain crunch and meatiness that fresh conch has. Lastly, similar to the squid, every piece was identical.It was seasoned with oil and Italian herbs and had no taste otherwise. The dressing was served in a plastic cup on the side. My hubby and I both took a few bites and honestly couldn\\'t bare to eat the rest. It looked fake. It tasted fake. And as sad as I am to say it, we were just grossed out.We\\'re not food snobs. We\\'re not \"foodies.\" And we certainly don\\'t discriminate when it comes to food or restaurants. 2 hours before visiting Sea Shore, my hubby was at Orchard Beach eating a hamburger from the Food Shack there. No complaints there. This review is about one thing: Price for quality. I \\'get\\' that this is a tourist trap-type of place that inflates its prices because of its location. But for such inflated prices, AT LEAST serve up fresh (and at the very least, REAL) seafood and put a little more effort into \\'taste\\' itself.P.S. We gave our server a hefty tip for the trouble and apologized for the inconvenience.',\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'My family came here on a beautiful Saturday night. This is one of the few restaurants on Arthur Ave. with sidewalk dining. The place is small and inviting with the feeling of a small bistro in Italy. We\\'ll get down to it. The place was a borderline 2 star experience overall, but I boosted it for it\\'s large portions and fair prices. Appetizers: Baked clams were very good and fresh. We also ordered the fried artichokes. They came out crispy, but were under seasoned. The only accompaniment for them was an odd choice of Russian Dressing smeared on the plate. Just a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of sea salt would have been perfect, Russian Dressing..ah no. We also ordered a flatbread with Arugala, Buffalo Mozzarella and Proscutto. It was very tasty, but the crust was store bought pita bread cut into rectangles and toasted. A bit odd for an Italian restaurant in the heart of Arthur Ave.Main Courses: My wife had Eggplant Parmesan, which she said was tasty and a good sized portion. My daughter had Chicken Parmesan which she enjoyed, And I had a special Veal Milanese, which was a whole bone-in Veal chop pounded and breaded and fried topped with fresh salad. It was huge and good, although similar to the artichokes under seasoned. It definitely needed salt.My other daughter\\'s dish was an issue, She ordered an Italian Dumpling dish that was on the special\\'s menu. We know this was the correct dish ordered because we had questions about it which the waiter answered before confirming the order. Somehow her dish came out and was Rigatoni and Shrimp. Fair enough, mistakes are made. The waiter came over and insisted that was what we ordered - - even after reminding him of the conversation about how the \"Dumplings\" are made. He then told us it would take time to make another dish, as if we were supposed to accept their mistake. After having to insist on the correct dish, which a customer should never have to do, we were told that the owner was going to get the dumplings for dinner but they will make it for us instead. I\\'m sorry, the owner? Am I supposed to feel some sort of gratitude that the customer comes first? Well after only 5 minutes the dish came out. And she enjoyed it. He should have simply said \"I\\'m sorry, let me get you the right dish.\"We decided to order some desserts. We ordered 3 items to share, A Pistachio Tartufo of sorts, profiteroles and Panna Cotta. the waiter came back and said they were out of Panna Cotta, so we didn\\'t have that, but then when the bill came they charged us for the Panna Cotta \\xa0-- AND THE WRONG RIGATONI DISH. The waiter didn\\'t return and instead we had to flag down the food runner. They removed the charges, but why did we have to sit there trying to get someone\\'s attention (there were only 2 occupied tables in the entire place)?While these issues irked us, at the end of the day it was a nice setting, the food overall was good, the prices reasonable and the portions were large.

Let me say, I have been to the establishment before and the food and customer service have been good. This could\\'ve been an extremely off day. We decided to go to the restaurant for their Rum Punch Brunch (basically a brunch/day party) My friends showed up at 2:20 and were seated at 2:50 by the host, initially they asked if they could be served mimosas (while they waited) since unlimited drinks were included in the price. They were told that they could not, because they needed to be seated. Why would that make a difference if the unlimited drinks were going to be stopped at 4 PM, and you paid upon entry ? When we sat at the table she said \" well, we about to stop serving drinks now anyway, it ends at 3PM\". Why wouldn\\'t you communicate that upfront, shows a lack of customer service ? Also, this was totally conflicting to what was posted online by the owner, the flyer said 4 PM. (there were two flyers on his page, one said 3 PM and the other 4 PM). Whose error is that? Making the best of the situation we processed to get food from the buffet. The host was still in the vicinity, our table was then taken by three gentlemen. When we called the host over to rectify, her response was \"somebody should\\'ve left their bag there to hold the seat\". Why would someone leave their purse unattended in a restaurant? What was the purpose of the host seating you ? At that point we decided to leave and requested a refund. We also asked to speak to a manager regarding there being two different ending times posted online. The response was \"he posted the \\xa0wrong flyer\". Again no effort to rectify the situation.Another thing, if someone ask a speak to a supervisor/manager it would be nice if they acknowledge the patron when they arrive to \"address to concerns\", and not talk about you in front of your face like you don\\'t exist. That is very rude and unprofessional. I believe everyone is entitled to fixing their mistakes. This was our experience on this specific day.

I always order delivery from Seamless and they are almost always on time. The delivery guy is very friendly. Second, it's a very small place, so if you want to dine-in it's probably not a good idea. It's good for take outs or deliveries. Like I said before I tasted almost everything on the menu and here are my thoughts:- The Vaquero quesadilla was very oily, I don't know if it's because of the meat or the cheese but it felt a little heavy.- Tipico quesadilla was much better, I guess it was because of the shredded chicken breast. The heaviness is much more bearable.- I only had Puerqito tacos. Overall taste was good but there was too much stuff on the tortilla so it was a little hard to eat.- Enchilada Rojas is my favorite, it's super delicious, you should try it!- Tinga Bowl was very good too, very filling and a little bit of everything.

The Tinga bowl which was supposed to be chicken in a tomato sauce tasted like raw tomato paste without any seasoning. It was a dollop of chicken and whole container of rice and a splash of Pico de Gallo that lacked brightness and and dollop of sad guacamole. The Churassco Bowel offered up non seasoned chewy steak (felt like a chew toy) The only saving grace was with that meal was that I had ordered the the green sauce which helped that dish tremendously. The Quesadilla was as tough as a brick and very unpleasant to eat It did not bring anything to the table. The cheese in the Quesadilla was similar to Play Dough.I hate to give a bad review to a restaurant especially a mom and pop style restaurant but It looks like you guys lost your soul/identity. I was hoping to come here and experience what some people have in your older reviews but I did not. I did not taste any love in the meals that were prepared. I was so taken back the first time that I ordered again just to see if it was a fluke based on the reviews. Ladies and gentleman it was not. It seems you guys have lost that passion.',\n",

Next time I will stick with quesadilla. The guacamole was fresh and chips was delicious. This is a nice place to order in the Bronx when you are looking for a quick Mexican bite.',\n",

We had already made decisions by the time our waiter told us the specials, so timing was a bit off.Service was friendly (our waiter was a little over the top animated) and attentive overall.We shared the tuna tartar (very good and quite spicy), the special grilled octopus (cooked very well - served over arugula with hearts of palm, olives and mandarin orange slices) and the hanger steak (over a portobello mushroom with gorgonzola, beets and asparagus - this dish was amazing!).We asked to have the dishes coursed out as we were sharing all of them. After we ordered I went to the bathroom, but it was occupied so I had to wait in a small hallway. I overheard our waiter tell the runner that the 3 dishes will be shared and should be coursed out, \"which sucks, but...\". I was confused - as was my husband when I returned to the table and told him what I had heard. It had no impact on our evening nor on the service/food, we just thought it very odd. And maybe a little reminder that staff should be careful what they say without knowing who is in ear shot.A very cute, trendy spot with delicious food - a must try',\n",

Sounds delicious yes.... well it wasn't. I was highly disappointed when I opened my plate and saw my Mac and cheese had burnt pieces of macaroni and was tasteless. I looked beyond that and went to the wings ... the wings still had the chicken feathers still on it but I continued the chicken had literally tasted as if it was a dry rub with only salt and pepper. The corn o the cob also too burnt with a dry rub that didn't taste too good. So time for my dessert the corn bread, and that tasted nothing like corn bread. It was bland, it lacked the texture. Nothing about this meal said soul food. The reception wasn't well either the young lady who was taking orders was annoyed with the customers, when I asked for butter for the cornbread she looked annoyed and didn't even answer me.the staff that was cooking the meal seemed to be teenagers not the prestigious chef that was suppose to be in the kitchen. Not to mention they have no menu, only the board, so those of us who have trouble seeing bring glasses. They do offer beverages but the cashier didn't seem to know exactly what they were. The overall area is small there's a picnic table and a few stools by the window where you can order to eat.

Our server was very pleasant and the manager kept stopping by, making sure that we were content with everything.We had both, their guacamole and quesadilla to start, which was OK. To be perfectly honest, the quesadilla could have used more oaxaca cheese and the guacamole could have been a larger serving for the price. I ordered a Fuego y Agua cocktail which was bomb, and their steak and eggs which was a bit scant. The price tag of everything seems a bit of a reach. I think they feel like their in an upcoming neighborhood and because the area code is 212, they can justify those prices. The amount of steak included in my $19 dish was laughable.The food tasted ok, nothing to write home about and certainly not warranting their prices but their in a great location so I guess you're paying for NYC adjacent?I gave four stars because they have some great drinks and the service was wonderful. I hope they do better with their portion size and pricing because 4 oz or less of skirt steak with some scrambled egg and fingerling taters is not worth 20 bucks.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'I think back to the line in the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where after a flight gets cancelled, Del Griffith says to Neil Paige, \"We have a better chance of playing pickup sticks with our butt cheeks than finding a flight out tonight.\" The same holds true for getting a table at Rao\\'s. It\\'s almost unfair to write this recommendation because once I tell you how amazing the meals are there, the fact that you might not be able to get a table will sting all the more.I won\\'t go into everything that\\'s already been written on the internet about the table system ... the tables are basically \\'owned\\' by people and they can give them away to friends, etc. if they aren\\'t using them. So essentially, this is a private club. Knowing someone who knows someone is probably the only way to get a table. There are some other little hacks you can employ, which I won\\'t go into here because they don\\'t always work.I have traveled all over Italy and eaten so many great authentic meals in my friend\\'s homes over the years ... usually cooked by an older Sicilian grandmother ... so I think I qualify as somewhat of an expert on good, authentic Italian cuisine. I am also not scared to spend all day laboring over a simmering pot of homemade sauce while pounding chicken cutlets in a hot kitchen. Let me just say that beyond the amazement of actually getting a table ... Rao\\'s served the most authentic and best tasting Italian food I think I\\'ve ever had.If you don\\'t have an Italian \\'nona\\' (grandmother) who still prepares her cooking the old way ... Rao\\'s will give you that type of experience. It is clear that all the ingredients are as fresh as you can get and the dishes are absolutely made with love. Sounds corny but what that means is respect for ingredients, made using a time honored recipe and tremendous quality control.The atmosphere is fantastic and there is an electric \\'buzz\\' in the restaurant. Everyone is happy here. Everyone. The staff here from the owners to the waiters seem like they are thrilled to be here and even though I am not a regular, they treated me with respect, humor and graciousness. I had a terrible experience at another restaurant slash private club in Paris called Chez Louis Amor which was considered one of the hardest reservations to get there ... the staff was rude, condescending and arrogant to \\'outsiders\\'. (and the food was average) Thankfully, Rao\\'s was the complete opposite. They made me feel I was dining in their home and the food was among the best I\\'ve ever had.Should you get a table here there is no menu. Someone in a suit will come and sit down at your table and ask you what you want. If it\\'s your first time, he will go through all the options for you. As is the case with most Italian meals at someone\\'s house ... there will be lots of courses. You are expected to try a lot of things ... don\\'t come here and think you\\'ll just get a salad and bread ... or an entrée. Just an example of what we (two people) had ... fried mozzarella cheese, calamari, pene with Vodka sauce, the famous meatballs and veal parmesan. We really wanted to try the lemon chicken but already we were worried about being too full. It was hard to resist the fresh bread and olive oil as well. You order wine by the glass or the bottle and the house red is fantastic, just like it usually is in Italy. All of the fried food was done perfectly. Lightly fried, accompanied with homemade sauce and cooked perfectly. Everything came out with perfect timing. One plate left, another arrived, etc. etc. There were two of us and the portions were perfect each time.The star of the show was the meatballs. You have to try these at Rao\\'s. They are hand made, pan fried and then baked so they are so juicy and flavorful. I\\'ve never had a better meatball. Another interesting dish was the Pene Vodka. As a huge fan of Rao\\'s sauce from the supermarket (I normally make my own sauce from a recipe I was given in Rome while helping an older women carry her bags at the grocery store) but when I don\\'t have all day to create a sauce, Rao\\'s jar sauce really is as good as anything you\\'d get at most restaurants. However, it was almost surreal to be eating the sauce in Rao\\'s vs. my own dining room. It is made fresh from scratch at the restaurant, but the taste is still remarkably similar to the home version. Trippy.Overall, I think you can tell that I\\'m a huge fan of Rao\\'s. I know I likely won\\'t get the opportunity to dine here often. However, I do hope to head back at some point and I am sure that follow up experiences will be as great as the first. Very rarely do you come across a restaurant where literally everything is perfect. Rao\\'s is that place ... you find yourself able to laugh louder, converse better and smile more when all the other details (food quality, service, atmosphere, etc.) are up to snuff. Anyone who leaves a 1 star review is someone who likely felt entitled to a seat here and could not get it. Once you\\'re in ... you\\'re in.',\n",

The shrimp however was seasoned well but not crispy enough.As for the sides, well the greens were under seasoned and the Mac required more cheese and some cream.Oh well to the levels of inconsistency I suppose my fish fry well be relegated to home cooking or Saturdays in Harlem or to Fordham Fish without southern comfort food sides.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"So my preliminary thoughts are this place is decent and allows for me to get my fried fish cravings on close to home without having to run to my old hoods of Harlem.The crispiness on deck, the portions enough for a day two possibly a day 3 if I ain't being a fatass #DontJudgeMeNow having grown up and maintaining my expectations of a good southern fish fry A Taste of Seafood and Famous Fish are main staples and the bar to which I judge a new spot.I'll admit the seasoning at Millie's was a little understated then what I was expecting but decent and my thoughts may have or will change if use the sauces, but for the most part I do my fish sauceless most of the time. I can't unfortunately speak on the sides because I was too afraid to try them and I didn't have the time in my run of errands.So overall the fish fry was good enough to warrant another visit especially since they open on Sundays.\",\n",

After a long wait I realized that 5 parties larger than mine had arrived and been seated before me so I went to speak to the manager. He informed me that he didn't sit us because our party of 4 included 2 children and people don't like sitting with children. I peeked inside and was able to see that every table had children and we weren't the only ones. At this point we've waited 90 minutes, after I say it's unacceptable he finally sits us at a table where we had to wait another hour until we got a cook.

I am new to the neighborhood, but coming from Queens, I am quite familiar with various types of Latin cuisine. That said, I consistently pressed my significant other to take me to this spot and we finally made it this past Friday evening. My first concern was not being greeted upon entering the establishment, okay, I can deal with that, as I know how local neighborhood eateries can be on a Friday night. Once, we were sat it took a few, a few meaning 15 minutes for a server to greet us, okay, I see what type of spot this is, but it stays packed, so I can let it go. But the following I cannot.Ultimately, like many other reviewers, our experience was similiar, great food, sub par service. Honestly, I can look past the service, if I can determine the amount of gratuity to give. However, upon paying the bill, my boyfriend noticed the number of guests totaled 6, (it was only he and I), which it seems allowed for automatic gratuity. Now we frequently eat at all types of restaurants, so are very familiar with gratuity expectations. Ultimately, we were disappointed in what appears to be a method to charge automatic gratuity to unsuspecting patrons. Interestingly enough, the table next to us was noticeably upset gratuity was automatically charged, but this was before we received our bill, so thinking back, the same could have been done to them. Unfortunately, the server(s) hurt themselves, as my boyfriend was prepared to leave more than the 15% automatic gratuity, mainly because of the food quality.My suggestion if going to this place: don't expect a 5 star service experience and be sure to CHECK YOUR BILL FOR THE AMOUNT OF GUESTS TO ENSURE ACCURACY!!!

Braised Beef Noodle Soup: wasn\\'t going to order this as I\\'ve tried so many times in the city but nothing was really satisfying. \\xa0 Still tried as their menu is not so big, luckily we tried. The soup was very flavorful, the meat was very tender, and the noodle was right in texture. Fish Filet & Tomato Noodle Soup: my least favorite among what we ordered as it\\'s little weird for my taste. It\\'s too thick as Asian soup dish for me I guess. Pickled Cabbage & Fatty Beef Mini Hot Pot: the main reason made me visit here, you don\\'t see many good ones in the city. Really tasty and lots of ingredients! Love it! But it\\'s the best when you eat there, I had the rest to go and the pickled cabbage did make everything taste very strong and salty as expected. Beef Tripe Mini Hot Pot: the lady warned us it\\'s very spicy, usually I can handle the \"very spicy\" in Manhattan. But this was truly truly very spicy... way too spicy for me to eat but it\\'s good spice as long as you can handle it.

They have a wide variety of flavorful drinks, such as herbal tea, plum juice, and pear juice. I loved the flavor of the pear drink. For the skewers, my favorites were the fish ball, quail egg, and tofu puff. I liked the spicy hot pot flavor of the skewers as well and I would recommend them overall. They were cold though and I would have preferred them served hot. I also think if they had more meat skewers added to the menu, that would be great.For the entree, I had the braised beef noodle. The best part of this dish would be the soft, tender, and juicy chunks of meat. I absolutely loved the spiciness of the broth as well. I think I would have preferred if we had a choice of noodle as I typically prefer a thicker one. I also liked that the dish came with a boiled egg.I tried the zha Jiang noodle as well. I got a sense of the creamy and peanut undertones in the sauce, which I enjoyed. However, it was actually hard for me to pick up on the nuance of the flavor palette for this dish as I believe my senses may have been slightly numbed from the spicy skewers and soup. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and I would recommend this spot for a quick bite or a nice lunch spot. Its rapid service definitely is appealing. \\xa0One thing I\\'d also like to note is the name seems to have changed to Chongqing Hot Pot Noodle and I believed the name should be changed to that on yelp as well.',\n",

There\\'s some seating along the window, in case you wanted to eat there. There wasn\\'t a huge variety of options for noodles so I ended up choosing the zha jiang mian or bean noodles which is my favorite. We ordered a bunch of different skewers as appetizers. My favorites were the fish balls and fish tofu and my least favorite was the potato. I just wasn\\'t a fan of the crunch of the potato. All of the skewers were the same spicy marinade and were served cold, which was a bit unusual. I also wish there were more traditional skewer options like chicken, beef or lamb. The zha jiang mian was a very unique flavor, definitely not like any I\\'ve had in the past. It was very nutty and a little spicy as well. I don\\'t really feel like it fits the flavor profile for zha jiang mian but I thought it was delicious, nonetheless. My friend ordered the spicy beef noodles and that was good as well, but I didn\\'t like it as much as my dish. The highlight of the dish was the beef - it was extremely tender and absorbed all the flavors of the broth. I was just sad that it didn\\'t come with more. Overall, I would say that the dishes served here are pretty good. Only thing I would change would be to have more options. A more expansive menu, or even just additional noodle options would\\'ve been great a great addition.',\n",

Started off with the coconut kiosk from the man with a machete. Each coconut is priced based on size; got a couple of $5 ones that had a moderate amount of juice in it. Plus side is that he cuts open the shell after you're finished so you can eat the filling inside (delicious). For the main course, ordered the jerk chicken on pita bread with mixed veggie toppings and hot sauce ($7). Jerk chicken is SUPER juicy, bursting with flavor that complimented very well by the marinated veggies.

The homemade bread is very good, the lamb and rice fine, even the falafel (which is not a Yemeni dish) was solid. My complaints are that the restaurant is dirty. Also, when I went with my mom and daughter, only men were eating there, just like in the Middle East. I am American, though my parents are from the Middle East, and I've witnessed this kind of gender segregation in the Middle East a lot. But hey, we're in America now, right?

They are doing because they are taking advantage of being in a white neighborhood , they know they can price their food at whatever price because people from that area will end up spending their money their eventually. Don't let these businesses treat you unfairly and upcharge you just because they want to make a profit off of your lack of knowledge with normal Chinese good prices.

No flavor in anything, oh and let me not forget the eggroll was also disgusting. Worst Chinese food I ever had in my entire life. I only ordered from them because most Chinese takeout do not accept credit cards & I didn't have any cash on me. I guess it's an easy way to hide their money to send back to their countries!

When we arrived we liked the fact that it was casual and not too stuffy. We ordered a French onion soup side of bacon and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was overdressed and the lettuce wasn't cleaned. The bacon wasn't crispy on the edges and it said it was a bourbon flavored bacon but didn't taste anything like it, The chefs failed attempt at putting greens on the plate was exactly that a failed attempt there was arugula undressed and wilted underneath the bacon. Onto the main course we ordered the porter house for two, Asparagus in the frizzy the onions. The steak arrived on a cold plate the juices were cold the steak was cold (no sizzle) there were four pieces of asparagus on the plate for the side and the frizzy onions were not appetizing at all, oily and not Crisp. I motioned to the waitress that our meal was cold, if you're going to attempt to be a New York City steakhouse then take away all of the sides and the steak and redo it. She left our sides which were already cold by the time this new steak arrived and it wasn't a new steak all they did was heat up our original steak. We ordered A medium rare steak, it was medium rare when It first arrive cold, however it was medium wellwhen I came out of the oven the second time. For $98 I would never go back to your restaurant. After sending back our food the waitress had an attitude and there was no reason to have one. It was not her fault that the food came out cold, however her attitude was a complete turn off to the rest of our meal we skipped the carrot cake and went home very very disappointed, I do not recommend the steakhouse. The pure fact that your manager did not come to my table to apologize for a cold hundred dollar steak, and then sent up a overdone steak in place of it which was basically just my steak reheated is completely amateur when it comes to the world of steak!

I ordered the snow crabs, with shrimp, vegetables, and choice of fries or baked potatoes for $32 or $35 and my son ordered the Salmon with choice of vegetables, fries, or potatoes for $18. Once your order is placed you are given a number that will be called over a loud speaker. This place is quite big and often very crowded. The normal wait for food is roughly 10 - 15 minutes.

You receive 3 shrimps (should be at least 5), what I don't like it the amount of grease that the food sits in when you receive your food, however the food does taste great and the seafood is very fresh. My son salmon was a decent size and was cooked fresh and taste great. The fries were even good; thin shoe string fries. You definitely get your monies worth considering the portion size.

The chicken tandoori was the show plate. Sizzling hot plate 2 portions of chicken on a bed of onions and sweet green peppers; for sure wort ordering. The tandori chicken was moust and very succult and the bed of onions and peppers was a nice touch. \\xa02nd best was the chicken tikka massala, the sauce was creamy. Nice seasoning not overpowering but you can still taste cumin, coriander and the garan masala. So while the sauce was on point, your lunch portion will be about 4 to 5 ounce container with lots of sauce and just 4 pieces of chicken. \\xa0No way you call that a lunch. I get it, making indian food is expensive due to the high cost of the spices. However, they could charge a bit more and give you more chicken. This portion was ridiculously small, plus i was still hungry in the end. If anything this portion should be for an appetizer instead of a main course meal. \\xa0The disappointment came about when we saw the chicken biryani. No raisins or any kind of fruit at all. \\xa0Usually the chicken \\xa0is cooked in the rice but this one the rice was made separate and the chicken was poured on top, \\xa0the rice lacked flavor and depth. \\xa0I felt like i should have just order white rice with a side of curry chicken. I do like the fact that you can bring your own wine and they do have nice glassware for the wine and water service; that is a plus for sure. Personally, i can appreciate that. \\xa0The place was clean, decor was not intrusive and best of all the smell of the \\xa0kitchen stayed in the kitchen. Sometimes you go have indian food and you cone out smelling like curry..lol The naan was tasty and made to order but could have benefited from a brushing of butter.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I am being quite generous with the three stars, but must be honest with my assessment of this particular Applebee's. The three-star rating is due to the abnormally long wait times for: 1) ordering drinks, and 2) receiving our meals once they were ordered. There was only two of us for lunch, yet once we were seated, it seems we were literally forgotten about. I had to physically get up from the booth and look for help. The strange thing about the long wait was that this place was almost empty of customers (after 2 p.m.), and I counted no less than five Applebee's employees in uniform walking around. Once the attendant came to our table, she was very courteous and took our drink orders. It then took another 15-minutes to receive our drinks. The female bartender seemed to by pretty occupied with a discussion with a customer at the bar, thus probably the reason for the delay with our simple drinks. After ordering our food, receiving it turned into another wait in excess of 15(+)-minutes. The food itself was well prepared, but the frustration from excess waiting cut into my being able to fully enjoy the meal. One final point is that there is no Wi-Fi at this establishment. I was given three different reasons from three different employees as to why there was no Wi-Fi for customer use. I cannot envision ever going back to eat at this particular location.\",\n",

AMBIANCE - very rustic decor with many oil paintings of Italian landscapes. Very traditional looking. Old school but niceMENU - traditional fare with specials enough variety for everyoneSERVICE- this was a 5 star item. Our waiter was quite congenial and had many amusing stories to share. FOOD - things were very mixed in this regard. The bread served was more like the kind you would get if you ordered a sandwich in a local deli. I mean they are next to one of the best bread stores on Arthur Avenue. For appetizers we had the octopus salad which had great oil and dressing but was slightly over cooked and a tad rubbery. Tried the mozzarella and tomato slices that were dressed well with balsamic and oil but the mozzarella was only ok. Again around the corner is Casa Mozzarella that has the best cheeses.ENTREES- I ordered the calamari fra diabolo that had a fantastic sauce but the calamari was also a tad over cooked. Wife had a a very delicious pasta dish with sausage and broccoli rabe. So overall I'm mixed on food rating. VINO - decent but nothing exceptional.

We ordered Peroni\\'s because \"when in Rome\". To start, we split the Mario Salad, which was just your average salad with a dressing a bit heavy on the vinegar factor. Now I do not like raviolis, but when I was younger I worked at a place that used to take a van down to Arthur Ave once a month and load it up with as much frozen raviolis as could fit. After that, I realized that I only liked Arthur Avenue\\'s raviolis. I tested it out here and I was not disappointed in the slightest.

Parking was easy for us since we went around noon time, not too sure how it would be during the night. We got seated really quick and the waitress was pretty attentive. He got the chicken chunks with the tostones as an additional side and I got the steak mofongo. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. The chicken chunks were so juicy; I just didn't understand how it tasted that good when to me it had looked like boneless wings (without the sauce). Usually, if chicken is that juicy, it wouldn't be white meat but surprisingly it was all white meat! The mofongo was abosolutely to die for. I think it was the fact that they had chicharron in the mix that made it divine. The crispy pork skin was an added bonus to the flavors. I didn't understand what was happening in my mouth after each bite but I liked it! The steak, however, could've been better only because it was thinly sliced and over cooked. If I had known, I would've gotten the chicken. But it's okay, you live and you learn. Overall, the food was excellent and I would recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking for some Latin food. They do have a Mexican menu as well but I've heard that it's not something you should order there lol.

I've also had the spicy beef which is actually pretty good, but not spicy at all. All of the combos come with pork fried rice which is average, as well as pork egg rolls which is also really bready. Portion sizes are average to large. probably enough food for 2 people.Service: Minimal, but what do you expect from a predominantly carry out joint.Eat in: small space with maybe 6 total tables and booths. Pretty empty most of the time so it's overall pretty quiet.Take out: all the food comes in take out containers so it's pretty easy and painless experience.Overall: decent chinese food. quiet, small space. good for carry out.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Tannat Wine and Cheese is a hidden gem in Inwood and our favorite local place in upper Manhattan. They specialize in sustainable, organic, biodynamic, natural wines and farm-to-table produce that is sourced from the Hudson Valley. They bar is run by a husband and wife team (Will & Sarah) and a small staff (including awesome bartenders Helen and Renee). The space is really intimate and beautiful, and feels like a little local family where everyone knows your name. It seats approximately 30 people, including bar seating and tables.Tannat offers a changing selection of wines by glass and bottle, but old favorites tend to reappear. They also have orange wines, which I'd not encountered before. The staff will let you sample before you order and suggest new wines for you to try. You can also purchase a half splash (half glass) of wine.The food menu changes daily and typically includes a selection of cheese plates and rotating meals and snacks. During the evenings they also offer a chef's 3 course tasting menu, and there is always an omnivore, vegetarian and vegan option. On the weekends they offer brunch, and vegan/gluten free an always be accommodated. Some of our go to items so far are the Tannat red wine, Two Block Rock cabinet and truffle cheese from the Hudson.The bar also hosts a number of community events, including poetry readings every third Sunday, wine master classes and live music. The team and bar are really lovely - and very unique in upper Manhattan. Definitely check them out when you're in the area.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'This wine bar opened a few months ago, and since we really enjoy a good glass (or bottle) of wine, we went to check it out. They offer natural wine and genuinely seasonal dining, hence, their menu for both wine and food changes throughout the year, on monthly or even daily bases sometimes. I love that you can get something new every time you visit!The inside is small, covered with wood from the floor, walls, and furniture, creating cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It has a nice big open door/window at the entrance, looking out to the beautiful greenery. They are across from Fort Tryon Park, and only a short walk from the MET Cloisters museum. Most of the wines are available by the splash (half the glass), glass, or bottle. They have sparkling, White, Rosé, Red, and Orange. I love the idea of splash, this way, we get to try more wines without too much commitment. Since there were three of us, we each got to try two different kinds of wine, total of 6 splash of different wines. They were all very good, and the staff was very knowledgeable of the wines, so he gave really good recommendations as well.When you are having good wines, you have to pair it with a good food companions. They offer farm-to-table, working with small Hudson Valley farms. We got Basil Duck Rillettes, Jacuterie Black Truffle Salami, Persian Cucumber, Smoked Trout Toast, and Wild Mushroom Pate. They were all good high quality, tasty and went great with the wines. The atmosphere was very comfortable, relaxing, cozy and welcoming. They have great wine (and beer) selections from all over the world. It is a great place to try out new wines that you never had opportunity or even heard of. The staff have great knowledge of the wines, we learned a lot from him. He was nice and attentive, he took a good care of us. It was a very nice first visit, I am sure we will return for more in a near future!',\n",

This large didn\\'t stretch like other Caribbean spots, where I can get 2/3 servings. The chicken was most and juicy and the skin had some good crisp/char, very flavorful with some heat and spice but not enough to meet my expectations.

The veggies were standard, raw cabbage, nothing wrong with that.

The Row was one of the businesses on the list with the better deals and the food was quite delicious that I will be going back! Like so delicious that I left and was actually raving about brussel sprouts! The green apples and golden raisins give the normally bitter veggies a sweet complex without drowning them in a sauce. The almonds made for a nice crunch texture along with the flaky crispy leaves that made you keep digging for another bite. \\xa0Even though everyone raves about the jerk mac & cheese let me start a fire by saying it wasn\\'t my favorite of the night. It was amazing as a mac & cheese. The combination of cheeses were great on their own, but I didn\\'t get much of that \"jerk\" taste. It was almost like I was eating a plain mac with chicken chunks. For entrees I had the pork chop and my friend had the pan/oven roasted chicken. Even though I was craving a thin greasy carribean piece of pork chop and felt disappointed when I saw this thick slab of porkchop presented to me, my disappointment ended there. The cut is a du-roc as the menu says, I thought it was porterhouse, but happy to be schooled on the different cuts of pork. Anyway for such a thick piece of pork loin, it was not dry and the peach ginger glaze was so good I wanted more. I was able to take a large amount home that my boyfriend enjoyed more than the lobster mac he asked for. The potatoes and the corn were perfect sides for this dish. For dessert I was able to order old fashioned peach cobbler and wow. I was happy I left some room for dessert because this was sooo good! It\\'s a thin layer of peaches on a hot cast iron pan giving you some crunch caramelized bits to enjoy. It felt light and not doughy so I didn\\'t feel gluttonous after. My only caveat is that the cast iron and pastry are so hot that my ice cream was half melted when it reached me. I love ice cream and the cold/hot variation of the dish was perfect for me. It was a Wednesday and they also have Jamaican nights on Wednesday in the fall with a live DJ. The specials are actually really good and though the music was loud I see myself coming back. May give the jerk mac another try as it\\'s a part of the specials. Finally, the staff was wonderful!

There was a combination of complex or different flavors to the Mac n\\' cheese so I liked how it wasn\\'t \"one level\". The Brussel sprouts were just right but didn\\'t stand out to me as much as the Mac n\\' cheese.The only slight negative aspect I would say is I feel like there was no bus boy?

Needless to say I didn't really care for the sprouts but the Mac and cheese was good but very spicy. For entrees you have a choice of chicken, salmon and pork chops. I was disappointed that for this to be a Caribbean restaurant you would think they would have more dishes with an island flair ( oxtails, curry, stewed) but they didn't.

Second the Nova Lox. Omg this was heavenly, the fish was very tender, cured well. Not overly salty, just right. Service 10/10, nice staff and a comfortable seating arrangement.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Preface: my family ordered takeout, so we did not eat the food fresh in the restaurant. We got brisket, corned beef, stuffed cabbage, and two knishes. We asked for first cut brisket (extra lean) and there was fat on every piece. The corned beef we ordered normal but it was a terrible cut of corned beef. It was a little bit of second cut (normal) and mostly inedible third cut. The corned beef was very fatty and grainy and just difficult to bite into and chew. The knishes were average. Nothing great and didn't have much flavor. Lastly and least was the stuffed cabbage. I've honestly never had such bad stuffed cabbage. I eat it every time I go to kosher delis as it's my favorite dish. The meat inside was tasteless and just very weak. Also small which was probably for the best. The cabbage wrapping was I don't even know how to describe. Weird texture, bad taste. And the sauce was very thin and didn't taste like normal sweet and sour sauce. I'd say the only thing that was truly decent was the coleslaw. Oh and the pickles. But we all know you can coleslaw and pickles at the supermarket and it will be good. There's a good chance this place doesn't provide as good quality and service for takeout orders versus in-dining. I felt a little sick in the stomach after the meal into the morning and my father said he didn't feel great. Best of luck to the rest of you who eat there and if you do then eat in and don't do takeout (because the two times I ate there it wasn't that bad)\",\n",

The pad woon sen although stir fried was also pretty light and had a decent amount of vegetables. The only negative I found was that they are a bit stingy with the meats, including tofu.

Not premixed, separates, smoky flavor, not too sweet, just sweet enough. Admittedly I like it sweet and with a little less crime but that's just my preference. I got the Pad Thai and it was EXCELLENT. Every bit as good as the best Thai I've ever had. Restaurant has a very calming effect. Atmosphere and ambiance is very relaxing. Lighting is great.

It's not this place's fault really and more about the rudeness of customers, but there needs to be some order when there's chaotic times.

I\\'ve had Moss mentally Bookmarked for a while- as I\\'m rarely on this side of The Bronx. But since I was in the nabe, couldn\\'t skip it. \\xa0By the way, you can\\'t kill too many hours on your laptop here- but there\\'s a designated time slot if you wanna power up. This is such an awesome cafe for many reasons. I mean...not only is style intact- but food is equally gorgeous to look at. FYI, there\\'s no Poultry and Beef on the menu. And no pork either- as Moss Café is kosher. I\\'m happy with all that!!! At least 98% of their Menu is Vegetarian, with a couple of Fish dishes. However I\\'m sure you can customize any dish and make it Vegan. Weekday Menu is broken from 8am-3pm/3-5pm, Dinner 5-9pm, with Sunday Brunch and Drinks. Walk right to the counter and order up. Hot or Iced Beverages are listed on large butcher paper and menus are on clipboards. Menu looks fabulous and decided on the Sourdough open-faced sandwich with Ricotta, Strawberry Jam, topped with Pistachios and a dusting of Cinnamon. Simple and Beautiful! Afhgani Chai to start was what I needed at the moment. And when I saw a Hot Chocolate on the menu, it just took those 7 little words, \"how do you make your Hot Chocolate?\" When Tess said, \"...Chocolate Ganache\"......I was sold. Plus- I can never pass up on an opportunity to taste Hot Chocolate. I knew I had to hit Moss when I was in the area. Attention to detail goes above and beyond - plus service was so nice. I enjoyed both my light meal and hot Beverages. Owners here have everything down to a Science- even with the soft \\'Chill\\' Music in the background. One thing\\'s for sure......there\\'s no shortage of endless bites and charming style.',\n",

So as mention I found out about this place after the run and from when you first enter the place the vibe is super chill, great music, and looks clean. They have a Taco Tuesday Special which was great as our group was about 13 people who all enjoyed the dollar tacos some sangria and also a bit of hookah which everything was priced very reasonably. I would say if it's a party of 10 or more they ask that you pay cash which possibly seem as people may have pulled a stunt with credit card fraud but they do have an atm onsite to withdraw money. Now I also grab some photos of the evening and it went swell. Hope this review was helpful.

We made clear we were only there for a drink & hookah. Even though there were PLENTY of tables available during a Sunday afternoon (tables were apparently only for eating, yet many people only had a hookah and drink on their table) she made us go to the bar which was full already.SO not only was there no space for a hookah at the bar but we had already ordered a disgusting sangria and had to drink it awkwardly standing around in the lower level. We left right after that one drink. I\\'m sure they\\'re used to servicing the same local crowds and you have to \"know\" people to get better service or what you want.

On the contrary, service was excellent. In the middle of this predominantly Italian neighborhood, there\\'s Caribe Restaurant. \\xa0Stone facade exterior stands out from the few businesses on the strip. But I have to give Caribe some props for getting all fancy and stuff and trying to hook up their restaurant with a so-called rustic interior: exposed ceiling pipes- (not sure if this is intentional or not---but hey, I think they wanna do like folks in NYC), metal accents here and there and a \\'pot rack\\' ceiling lamp. But what really threw me off, was the freaking head of a cow as soon as you walk in with big as* horns and a reindeer head (in the back dining space) behind me. That sight, really wasn\\'t my bag of chips. At. All. And since when did Dominicans get on this freaking taxidermy craziness? I honestly thought I was in a hunting lodge. Anyhow, service was great for my party of 8. By the way, if you don\\'t know the get-up in some Dominican restaurants don\\'t take offense- \\xa0if waitresses don\\'t engage in non-stop chitchatter with you or have an ear-to-ear smile, it\\'s just how they do. However, our server was spot on- girl didn\\'t even take orders down on paper,- she just memorized everyone\\'s orders by heart and didn\\'t skip a beat when dishes were brought to the table. Offerings here are typical Dominican: Mangú, Fried White Cheese, Fried Eggs for Breakfast and Moro with your choice of stewed meats for Lunch or Dinner. Martinis? Nope. Forget it about it. Not the spot. Maybe a Sangria otherwise keep it straight up and nothing fancy. Portions? Ridiculously large. Prices are reasonable for typical, down-home food.

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'I\\'ve been hearing good things about this place for years since when it was known as Feeding Tree. Either it was heavily hyped or things changed quite a bit. I came hungry one evening with my fiancé (who happens to be West Indian) and was excited to get what I thought would be some good jerk chicken.The first clue that something wasn\\'t right should have been when my order came to $28 for a large order of jerk chicken and two cans of Diet Coke. When the cashier told me the cost, I must have seemed stunned, and asked, \"How much??\" I shouldn\\'t have paid and should have just cancelled the order, but by then I was starving. The cashier explained that they charged per pound ($12/lb.) and it was 2 lbs. Already feeling cheated, I came to discover that the \"jerk\" chicken was...barbecued, burnt chicken with sauce that they passed off as jerk that we figured out was likely a mixture of ketchup, vinegar, and pepper. I\\'ve had good jerk, great jerk even, and I\\'ve also had much better chicken for much less. After finishing my $28 meal, I not only felt cheated, but I felt angry. If you haven\\'t had the pleasure of having eaten good jerk chicken or pork, you can do so and a large order should cost you around $14, nearly half as much as this mediocre meal. Some places try to cut corners by purposefully burning the chicken and pouring cheap hot sauce over it, then passing it off as \"jerk.\" Verdict: if I want good jerk, I\\'ll go to Gun Hill or Flatbush Ave. or eat my friend\\'s amazing jerk pork. Eating Tree is trash food by people who try to rip you off.Bonus: one of the employees chased this guy outside to yell at him because of the trash he left on the table. One problem: he didn\\'t leave the trash there and it was there way before him. So not only are they con artists with bad food, they also have no customer service.',\n",

I made reservations through the Yelp app after checking out their food pix and reviews. We had to modify the reservation and push it back a bit which was not a problem. When we arrived, we were seated immediately and the host was very nice.It's a cute little spot. I like the decor in the dining area. It feels old but polished with the vintage style decor. The bar in the front is small but it's beautiful. It felt like we were transported to the roaring 2o's. I love the painted exposed brick, dark tables and mixture of different chairs. It definitely gives off a cool ass vibe.They have a seductive drink list with many interesting cocktails. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers including, truffle fries, catfish bites and Mac & Cheese. I'm thankful we ordered so much to begin with because it was all very tasty.Unfortunately, my main dish left much to be desired. My friend had the salmon which she loved. I ordered what I thought would be a ribeye and for the price, I expected a legit, sizeable ribeye. Instead, I received something else. What they tried to pawn off to me as an almost 40 dollar rib eye looked more like a poorly sliced, thin NY Strip that they attempted butchering to stretch their inventory, but I digress. I didn't make a big stink about it. The temperature was way off in some spots because it was so unevenly cut and cooked that I just sent it back. I ordered medium temp and most of it was well-done/medium-well.If you know me by know, you know I don't reorder food once my order has been messed up. I'd rather grab something from elsewhere on the way home if I'm still hungry and maybe come back to the establishment another day, if it pleases me to do so. Luckily, the apps filled me sufficiently so another stop was not necessary.The most important thing is that my girlfriend enjoyed her meal. We shared some beignets with dipping sauces for dessert. The server overhead us talking about it being my girlfriend's birthday and he gave her a little candle to blow out which was nice.To the credit of the manager, he came by to check on us after I sent back my steak. He offered to make me something else but I refused and thanked him. Like I said, I'm not opposed to a return visit but I would probably only order drinks and apps. To slap on a hefty $38 price tag on an entrée item and to send out what was given to me definitely has me on high alert when it comes to the integrity of their kitchen. You be the judge (check the picture of my main). The steak was only accompanied by one hasselback potato and a few matcha onion rings; very unique sides but you know you're paying for that protein. I expected much better.To end on a high note, they also have a speakeasy called, Room 623, located below the dining area, with live music. I wouldn't mind coming back for a date night with the hubbs and maybe even dress up for the evening. I would definitely return.\",\n",

It came in an edible fried bowl (just picture that because I go no picture) filled with muscles, scallops, shrimp calamari ad some fresh greens. HOWEVER, when I say Salty, I mean SALT-AY. At that first bite I realized that the appetizer could hold me down. Me and my date decided to leave because I started \\xa0getting some weird vibes(the hurry up and leave so we can close up vibes from \\xa0staff ) as we were the ONLY ONES there late night 12:00 AM. \\xa0So we left, because I felt uncomfortable. The host was also a bit off. Overall, three stars is my review. \\xa0Would I go again? Maybe.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I went to Renaissance with a group of 5 women. I had the lobster BLT with truffle fries & a lemonade. The food was good, the menu had great options. However, I did not care for the service. 40 minutes passed between the time our order was taken & the food was served. Also, we had to remind our waitress about drinks. Our waitress was inattentive & a bit unkind but other wait staff tended to their tables somewhat promptly. I'm not sure if our waitress was new or just having a bad day but I did not appreciate our service. We even had to ask the manager for water & for our check. I would like to go to Renaissance again because the food was great & I'd like to experience their dinner menu but I'd hope the service is better.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I've been eating Dyre Fish Market for years. You can't go wrong with steamed seafood. They have a large selection of entrees for you to choose from. Whether you're in the mood for crab legs, shrimp, clams, salmon, scallops, porgie fish, whiting fish, red snapper fish, or even king fish, this place has it all. You can pair your steamed fish entree with either veggies (they have; broccoli, carrots, potato, okra, pumpkin, spinach, corn, string beans, and mushrooms to choose from all bagged up) or yellow rice. Other side orders includes: French fries, crab sticks, crab cake, fruit salad, calamari, veggie salad, or seafood salad. Even if you're not in the mood for steamed seafood, they also have a fried fish option which is served with either yellow rice or French fries. So how it works is that you pick up a basket and select what type of seafood you would like to either be steamed or fried along with any combination of vegetables. After, you hand your basket to one of the workers that will begin to first, 1. Wash your seafood and vegetables and then 2. season your food. I usually tell them to put all of their seasonings and make it EXTRA spicy. Please let them know of any known allergies! Next, they will put it in a steamer and give you your ticket number (do not lose it). This process takes about 25-30 minutes depending on how busy it is inside and what type of seafood you selected. They also accepts EBT and has an ATM available. However, you may use a card as a form of payment. Pros: 1. Great location and reasonable price 2. Food is always tasty and consistent 3. They have a large selection of seafood 4. They have somewhere where you can sit and wait for your food if you choose to do that5. You select your own seafood and vegetables 6. You can always call ahead and place a order for pick up. Cons:1. When it is busy, it is busy and the wait time is usually longer 2. Most times there are no street parking 3. They are not open 24hrsTip: *Tell them to leave the juice and add butter* just like that!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"So you go in there and it's like an assembly line. You pick up the tray and put the vegetables and seafood you want in it.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"This is a small little fish market on the corner of Dyre Ave aka a little hole in the wall of seafood goodness. Food is cooked how you like it: either fried or steamed. All the seafood is out on Ice for you to put in a container to hand to the guys by the steamer so that they can season your food in-front of you. Don't forget to pick your side items!I was with four people and we all ordered the following to share: shrimp, snow crab legs, and steamed salmon with sweet plantains, potatoes, corn on the cob, broccoli, onions, and peppers. We also ordered fried shrimp and a fried red snapper. Both the fried fish and the fried red snapper came with a side of yellow rice, which we chose as opposed to a side of fries.All of our sides except the rice were way too over cooked. Maybe they can figure out a way to throw in the veggie sides in a little after the fish is in the steamer because they almost all turned into mush. Not sure if this is the texture they are going for, but we all agreed the sides were way too soft (still tasty because of all the seasoning). Overall, super delicious, a bit of a wait for your food to cook, sides a bit too soft, employees all super friendly!\",\n",

The first time was nothing to write about but definitely better than what we just got.We ordered a cheeseburger, volcano burger and tater tots. The cheeseburger was decent. I ordered it medium well but probably should have got medium. The volcano burger was ordered well done but was burnt. It's basically a cheeseburger but with a mound of cheese. We were excited to trying it being such cheese lovers. The cheese melted so it was like a pancake of cheese which was fine but it was burnt. You could taste the burnt flavor in it. The bun was grilled but the lines were pretty charred. So all together it was pretty bad. We called to get a refund and what made matters worse was the owners attitude. He said it was ordered well done. As to imply we should have expected it that way. Also tried to say it's a hard burger for take out. If that is the case then train your staff to educate the guests so they know what they're getting into. We didn't care that the cheese melted, just didn't want it burned. We ended up taking everything back since we still needed to buy food for dinner and didn't want them thinking we ate it. He seemed pretty upset we brought everything back, but still gave us a refund. Well actually he didn't want to be bothered, the young lady who was behind the counter assisted us. She was probably the most professional in there. The bill was only $26, it wasn't about that. The volcano burger was so bad it was not edible. Then the owner (or whoever the gentleman was) had a nasty attitude which didn't help the matter. We won't be trying it for a third time, we'll stick to Patricia's, which is right next door. We were actually debating between the two, guess we made the wrong decision.\",\n",

It was edible, but it wasn't spectacular in any way that it made me want to order from here again in the future.

Even though the space is semi-compartmentalized, it flows nicely and has all the components one would expect to find in a diner.

The wrap contained grilled chicken breast, guac, and cheddar jack cheese - \\xa0it also came with a side of fries. I wasn't too impressed with the wrap; the contents weren't really defined - it kind of all melded into one, and the flavors weren't big. The fries were average - I would have liked to have seen more on the plate. Overall, I find Crosstown to be an average diner. While I would normally give a place like this a 3, after looking at the prices on the menu I'm giving them a 2. A forgettable wrap with a few fries cost $14? Wow - you can totally get a better deal elsewhere. I think Crosstown does a great job with their social media and neighborhood presence, but for me it has to be about the food - especially at these prices.\",\n",

Premium Sweets is located in the Parkchester area of the Bronx and is in a primarily Bangladeshi community. Parking can be a bit of a pain but eventually you will find street parking. There is meter parking available (.25 for 15 minutes until 7pm). The area is very reminiscent of Jackson heights. The venue is very modest and has a simple set up with a few small tables and chairs in the back. The venue is clean and manned by multiple staff. The owner Mr. Khan is so NICE! He immediately greeted my family and I and asked us to stay for dinner (I've never met this gentleman before but I immediately felt and was treated like family). I asked Mr. Khan what he could suggest for a meal as there were a huge variety of items available because of Ramadan. Shortly after being seated, staff began to bring over a variety of dishes. We shared the chicken and beef biryani, various iftar fritters, & salad. The tamarind sauce served on the side was so sweet, sour and mildly spicy, and complimented the fried items. The beef biryani was delicious! The meat was so tender and melted away as you ate it. The salad was crisp and the green chilies on the side were fresh and fiery hot [just the way I like em]! After finishing our meal, Mr. Khan brought us dessert! The variety included jalebis, gulab jamun & kala jamun. All of the sweets were perfection! Fresh, soft, & sweet. The restaurant sells traditional Indian sweets for $7.99 a pound which are available in a refrigerated case in the front of the store. Next to the register is a buffet style variety of Indian/Bangladeshi dishes. Because of Ramadan, there were also trays of fried goodness available for very reasonable prices, varying from 3 items for a dollar to one dollar each item. We also tried the chicken samosas which were crispy and packed full of well seasoned mildly spicy filling. The chicken tikki were delicious too! The restaurant has a cooler with typical drinks, soda, bottled water, etc. Tea is also readily available. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant for the sweets, the food and most importantly the amazing customer service and the ever so wonderful Mr. Khan.\",\n",

It's so so good and I wish I could eat this as an appetizer all the time. I was a little skeptical I would like it, but now I crave this dish! As for dinner, I always end up ordering off the specials list but the chicken dish, Cornish hen, and filet mignon are all winners, too. I'm always up for trying new things so I try and order something different each time I come. As for drinks, they don't hand you a cocktail menu, but they have a full bar. We always opt for wine, but close out with one of their dessert martinis. My go-to is the espresso, but the chocolate one is good, too. For dessert, we always got for the Croatian style crepes with Nutella and ice cream. Maybe next time we'll go for a different dessert.

The pupusas came with a tomato based sauce and spicy coleslaw and the tamale came with sour cream. Honestly - it was the best meal I've had in the neighborhood in a very long time.

Around 11:30-12 is when the place really starts to fill up. You are forced to leave your table as they clear it for dancing and unless you purchase a bottle package they do not allow you to sit at the booths around the lounge.

I by accidentally stopped here during my lunch break thinking that my co-worker was here because the same car was parked out front. If not for that, I don't believe I would have stumbled upon this GEM. Do not judge this place by the way that it looks, you will be super surprised to find out that a restaurants decor have nothin to do with how good or bad the food is. Or at least that's what you learn about this place. They have a great buffet with 25 different items which isn't what I really come there for so I wouldn't be able to comment on that food.....But in the back area is a man, standing behind a counter with 15 to 20 different rotating meats. Some cooked well done, some cooked rare, and all the others in between. He grabs a plate and asks what you want, then he'll grab the slab, cut a small price to ask you if you agree with the temperature of the meat or if you'd like to go more rare or more well done. After you choose he asks how many slices you'd like and if you want it cut up or not. He serves you your plate, puts a dash of salt on the end he cut from and hooks it back onto the big fire pit. The meat is the juiciest, most flavorful, fresh, type of meat I've come across at a restaurant in a long time. I happen to be something of a steak connoisseur, so peter Lugers, Bobby flays and Wolfgang's are regular places I go to for steak, and I have to say this place will give any of them a run for their money. Go there and enjoy!!!! I haven't been at night or on a weekend but it believe they have parties and Dj's, it's Brazilian, so expect some of that awesome Booty shaking music.\",\n",

They have warm foods ready at the buffet station, but the pros know to go straight to the meat rotisseries and stack your plate with meats first! I usually get the top sirloin, hanger steak, beef ribs, and two chicken sausages! Always ask for MEDIUM to avoid getting well done steak. It's extremely difficult for them to keep all the consistencies of steak ready for you so you'll have to settle for one of the extremes, either over cooked or slightly bloody (I choose the latter). They charge you by the pound so DO NOT get carried away with heavy items such as mashed potatoes or rice. Not worth it in my opinion-- I'd rather use that weight for some juicy meats\",\n",

Once seated (we requested the outdoor patio) we inquired about the special and were told it was a Mon-Fri deal disappointed but we decided to stay. The menu is limited and pricey so many others entering asked about the special after being seated and got up and left. We opted for the calamari, seafood salad, seafood linguini chefs special, penne a la vodka and lobster ravioli. I must say the appetizers had the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The calamari nice and soft, the mussels in the salad the cleanest, not one grain of sand and the smoothest slivers of oysters. My sister ordered the penne, it's her usual when she finds it on any menu and she was impressed. My ravioli was a generous serving and deliciously creamy, my mom said her special was so delicious her only regret was not wanting to get dirty tearing into her lobster. Sorry I have no photos on this meal as we were enjoying it all to well.

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'It was date night and we decided to use good ole\\' Groupon for a surf and turf deal as my cravings for lobster come often. I haven\\'t been to City Island in years so going to Portofino on a school night (Wednesday) seemed perfect. I imagine the weekends are pretty crowded and I wanted to have nice quiet time. As you walk in you\\'ll notice a very traditional sit-down Italian restaurant decor. This place is huge and I can definitely see huge parties held here. Since we decided to go on a Wednesday evening there was absolutely no crowd (there were maybe a total of 6-8 other people besides us) and plenty of parking. \\xa0The staff (waitress and server/hostess) were really friendly and welcoming. They checked in on us a few times and made sure everything was to our liking. Our Groupon included: 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 surf and turf entrees (a lobster tail and steak), and 2 desserts. The Cabernet Sauvignon we selected was delicious (photo attached). We decided to go with a shared appetizer for an extra cost. It was the Hot AntiPasto for 2: Shrimp, Fried Calamari, Stuffed Mushrooms, Eggplant, Rollatini, and Baked Clams.If you are starving I would suggest this. The sizing was pretty large for us as I started to get full after eating this. The shrimp, calamari and baked clams were delicious. Everything else was just friend mush. Our surf and turf entrees consisted of a large lobster tail and steak. I asked for Medium-well (don\\'t judge me) and ended up getting a well-well done steak. I did not need to use the butter sauce as the lobster tail was extra seasoned. The veggies (carrots and string-beans) were cooked in some buttery garlic sauce I loved it. So I ate the lobster tail and veggies for most of my entree. Our deal also included 2 desserts. By this time we were so stuffed we did not even want to see the dessert menu so the waiter offered to give us the desserts to go. This was so kind and I\\'m glad we did not have to ask for it be wrapped up. The waiter offered this before we even know what was being offered. I asked and he named several cheesecake flavors.I am not a fan of any type of cheesecake so my date was about to have the bomb late night snack. We ordered a raspberry cheese cake and a chocolate cheesecake to go. Before leaving the waiter offered us some homemade sambuca (fig and raisin). It was the bomb. It was so sweet and strong at the same time - I loved it! Our night was lovely, we had a great dinner and all is well. Fast forward to the unwrapping of the desserts. We open the first container of the \"raspberry\" cheese cake. We notice there are no raspberries there are actually strawberries on top. Ok that\\'s fine. We wouldn\\'t have complained about that but as we go to get a fork (I was willing to try it)we notice some mold on one of the strawberries. We both took a better look at this and quickly threw the slice of cheese cake away. My date did inspect and try the chocolate cheese cake but didn\\'t feel comfortable eating it. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the wine, the amount of food for the price and I can so see this being such a great outdoor dinner spot during the summer but I\\'m not sure I\\'ll return because mold on food is not really a good look.

Our server was very nice. They seated us at a table with enough room for our stroller. Hubby and I shared some Jerk Chicken Mac & Cheese which was OK. Hubby ordered their burger and I had the Oxtail Wrap. Hubby really enjoyed his burger jut I did not care for my wrap at all. Calling it a rice wrap with some oxtail shavings would be more accurate. For the price, I would have expected to have a good amount of meat but you could hardly even see where the meat was, other than by the dark color of it. It looked more like oxtail gravy and rice in my wrap. I immediately regretted my order upon receiving it.I ate half of it and gave the other to my son. It was all rice! I'm still amazed they even serve it like that. I enjoyed their sorrel with some Jamaican rum and as I said, the service was very good although the wait for food was a bit long.I doubt we'll be back. They're pretty pricey but I don't feel like, for the West Indian food, you're getting much bang for your buck.

Do you know when you have a feeling that a place is just not going to be right? That's the feeling is soon as I walked in this place. We asked for a child seat. The waiter brought over one of the wooden seats, but the strap was broken. When we mentioned to him that we can't put the child in with a broken strap, he said he would look for a Nother seat. He came back about 10 minutes later, and said that all of the other seats were in use. But a quick scan of the restaurant, show that there were no other children in the place, who were using a child seat. So I guess the real answer is that they only had one seat, and it was broken. Straight line.Next, we placed our orders, and I asked for coffee. It showed up about five minutes later, and a very small cup, and it was tepid. Not even warm. My friend ordered the steak and eggs (even though I warned her that this was probably going to be a disaster), and she asked for cheese in her scrambled eggs. I ordered an omelette with tomato, spinach, turkey bacon, and cheddar cheese. My friend asked for an order of fried plantains for her son.The waiter was diligently writing down the order on iPad, but I had a feeling he was getting it wrong, because he was not listening closely to what we were asking him.It took quite some time for food to arrive, but when it did, it was just bad. My friend's steak, which (I warned her against getting) was truly like the sole of someone's \\xa0shoe. She had requested the steak be cooked medium, and it truly resembled a piece of leather. The eggs that she asked to include cheese, came cheeseless. And the fried plantains for her son were like potatoes: they were not at all ripe. The home fries that were served with it were quite dry. I requested ketchup, twice, and it never appeared. My tepid coffee was finished, so I asked for water. Instead. No one ever offered to refill my coffee cup, nor did anyone come to refill our water glasses. Then, the waiter appeared halfway through our meal with a plate of eggs with cheese on them. My friend was no longer interested in them, as they were not hot, Undercooked (salmonella, anyone?) and had a few dots of cheese here and there.When country kitchen was at this location, it was such a wonderful restaurant. This place seems to be focused on drinks, and witty repartee, but not so much on providing good food. At least not at breakfast. I think I will pass on it, forever.\",\n",

After we were seated, we didn't see our waiter for over 20 minutes until I flagged someone down and asked where our waiter was. She eventually came to take our drink/food orders but after that we never saw her again. I had to flag someone else down to get our bill.

It described itself as \"Jamaican style,\" thinking it was like Chipotle being \"Mexican cuisine.\" I\\'m doing jury duty and took a chance on it last Friday got lunch. The set up is a small buffet-style restaurant charging $7.99/lb. or $11.99/lb. if you opt for their seafood options. I tried to go as close to 1 pound as possible to see what you get for that price. Friday I had some rice and peas, a few pieces of curry chicken, string beans, and some jerk pork. Today I tried the jerk chicken wings, provisions (callaloo), sweet plantains, okra, and Rasta pasta.The chicken was well seasoned. I liked the different layout of vegetable options to balance things, so I guess it\\'s theoretically possible to eat here as a vegetarian. I\\'ve never had Rasta pasta before, and am not a huge pasta fan, but the spiciness/heat of it was an interesting juxtaposition. I saw that served ackee and saltfish, as well as things like cheese and bun, carrot cake, Irish seamoss, peanut punch, and some fresh juices. I also saw roti on the menu, which I haven\\'t yet tried. I know a good roti when I eat one, so I\\'m a tough critic. All in all, this is probably the best option for lunch around here if you like variety and aren\\'t afraid of spice. That being said, this is definitely not your Chipotle-style take on Jamaican food- it\\'s the real thing, so give it a shot.',\n",

       "  'Negative Review 3': 'We arrived at the restaurant \\xa0when there was \\xa0no one seating in the first floor, and we asked to be seated in the first floor; the person in charge of seating told us the first floor \\xa0was reserved for people with \"physical disabilities\".... So we sort of agreed to be seated \\xa0in \\xa0the basement \\xa0area, but given the size of the first floor we \\xa0inquired once \\xa0again if we could be seated there \\xa0as we were being escorted down to \\xa0the basement...But the \\xa0same line was repeated to \\xa0us. The basement felt \\xa0crowded and claustrophobic.The restaurant was strangely NonBlack. In fact \\xa0there was only one black person in the \\xa0restaurant, and she was some sort of waiter; the rest of the waiters and clientele were all \\xa0white including the \\xa0Hispanic \\xa0waiter who took care of us. Needless to say, my partner and I felt rather odd dining in an all White restaurant in the center of Harlem, a \\xa0predominantly African American neighborhood with higher than average unemployment rates for the city, \\xa0but we sort of dismissed \\xa0the issue and \\xa0proceeded to order some drinks as we looked \\xa0 through \\xa0the menu. Most of the listings \\xa0in the menu were rather meat oriented and entirely out of touch with modern vegan trends, and decidedly on the \\xa0pricey range for a restaurant in a neighborhood where rents are significantly cheaper than downtown; but \\xa0we sort of dismissed the price issue. \\xa0 Accompanying us were two wine conosours with a worldly slant; my partner and I are both Gay \\xa0Manhattanites, worldly, philanthropists.As we settled in our seats, something all 4 of us found extremely annoying was the constant pestering by the staff inquiring if we were ready to order. So annoying were these constant visitations that my partner, a rather softspoken man of understated elegance, asked one of the waiters to give us some time to breathe... But even as we hastened the pace at which \\xa0 we \\xa0consumed \\xa0our aperitives and appetizers our table was visited perhaps another 4 \\xa0times by varying levels \\xa0of waiters asking if we were ready to order our \\xa0main course. \\xa0 We had only been at the restaurant perhaps 15 minutes, but somehow the service felt we had to be gulping down our \\xa0food already. We proceeded to order two rather expensive bottles of wine. \\xa0And finally had our main courses. \\xa0Sadly, the food was subpar but edible, nothing really intelligently concocted, and if I may add, \\xa0severely lacking in cullinary imagination and subtlety. The wines \\xa0were \\xa0an interesting exercise. \\xa0I don\\'t even recall if we had dessert. The whole experience was so creepy and \\xa0vulgar that we kind of ran out of the place. Over 600 dollars later, and in less that one hour after \\xa0arrival. We were processed out of the place. But our shock was yet to come. \\xa0We proceed to climb up the steep flight of stairs \\xa0from the basement area \\xa0where we had been hastily railroaded to by the service \"because the first floor of the restaurant is \\xa0reserved for people with disabilities\". \\xa0As we looked around the first floor, we noticed a crowd of perfectly able people, most of them in their 30s. I snapped two pictures and informed one of the waiters who sat us \\xa0that she \\xa0had lied and pushed us to the basement because \\xa0according to her only people with disabilities \\xa0could sit upstairs. Her reply, \"I didn\\'t say that\". I accused her of lying again. \\xa0It has taken me \\xa0over a month to write about our \\xa0horrid experience in this creepy \\xa0all White restaurant in the middle of a Black neighborhood. \\xa0Never again! And we are making sure our hundreds of friends hear about it.My final words to the owner of this processing trap is, have you no shame? And how low can you go? How can you justify hiring so very \\xa0few AA at your joint when the unemployment rate in Harlem is at least 2% higher than it is downtown, and the income Per Capita \\xa0way below the NYC\\'s \\xa0average? \\xa0Shame on you again, and we will definitely be talking about this!'},\n",

They also have a huge private room where you can rent out to celebrate an event/special milestone in your life. I came here for a birthday party and the whole thing lasted about 4 hours or so.We had an open bar, buffet and a DJ, but keep in mind I'm pretty sure you can be creative and customize your party theme as desired.I'm a sucker for their pasta, fried chicken, chicken Parmesan and steamed vegetables. The staff treated us with the utmost respect and attended to all of our needs.Honestly I'd like to visit again and hang out by the bar and take advantage of their Irish breakfast.\",\n",

I absolutely hate writing negative reviews but this is the second time my boyfriend and I had a negative experience at Eileen\\'s/The Heritage. The first visit, we sat outside for dinner on a Tuesday night. We sat on \"The Heritage\" side if that makes a difference. The waitress took our order.... we asked for a medium rare burger and a fajita salad. We got a very well done burger, and the fajita salad was literally fajitas and a pile of lettuce.... the chicken was extremely over cooked and I barely ate it. Waitress barely checked on us. The second visit was a Friday morning (today!), and we sat outside again but on the Eileen\\'s side. We had the SAME waitress. We ordered iced coffees, pancake deluxe and Belgian waffle deluxe ( comes with sides of eggs and meat). Iced coffees came out, she brought milk but no sugar. Food came out with a different waitress and didn\\'t bring any of the sides we asked for- eggs, meat, fruit for my boyfriend and eggs for myself. The bacon I got was cold like it had been sitting. We finally got the rest of our food- and had to ask 3 times for the side of bananas which we never got. At this point we are not sure if it\\'s the kitchen staff or waitress being incompetent since every single order we had came out wrong the first time. After we ate we waited about 15 minutes waiting for someone to check on us and nothing - my boyfriend went inside and paid and said it was busy. We are very understanding BUT you have customers outside who are being ignored. We won\\'t be returning. The (correct) food once we got it was very good, but the service needs work!',\n",

The owner wasted no time in saying that he will not be sending anyone with the remainder of the food because they were too, \"busy\" over the phone and proceeded to put the phone down and leave me waiting for his return. When he did, he just said hello and hung up. I called again and he told me that there\\'s nothing he can do, where I let him know that if that\\'s the case, then he can have his food back and I can get my money back. He nonchalantly said, \"I\\'ll be here\" and hung up the phone.I realized my only option forward was to settle for whatever I was given in the delivery, although I had already paid for the entire order, or go in person and handle this matter.I went to the restaurant where the older gentleman who takes the orders told me he wasn\\'t going to give me any money back because he \"would have to put the food in the fridge and sell it again to make money from it\"I ran out of patience at that point and demanded my money back and he can have the food. He proceeded to call the police department in an attempt to maybe dissuade me from pursuing my money back.The police ended up mediating the situation by asking the older gentleman with the glasses to return my money, since I was offering the food right back to him (mind you, I ordered a delivery, and had to make my way to the restaurant with the food for this to happen)It was terrible and disgusting to see the business owner handling things like that. Even the police officer remarked that he\\'s going to lose a lot of business because of this. It\\'s clear that this restaurant is not the place to order from again from me, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE order from there!! Order from any of the other good diners around the area!

Adding another waiter would help.3. Drinks - They're strict with Happy Hour drinks. I was brought my second drink 5 minutes before Happy Hour ended (after waiting 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention) and wanted to order another but was denied, even when I chugged the drink I just received in the front of the waiter. The drinks are good though, that I can't complain about. They're the third best Mexican cocktails in the neighborhood behind Refried Beans and Guadalupe.4.

I called and spoke with him saying how wrong it was for them to take my money and not even replace the samosas I brought back after they originally told me I could replace them. He says, come back at 5pm and they will make a new batch because he said he wouldn\\'t be there for a few hours. At 5pm, I call again and speak with the owner and remind him that he said a new batch would be made if I come by. He now says, \"uhhhhh, I don\\'t know I have to speak with my son, blah blah blah.\" Basically, saying, they have no plans whatsoever of replacing them. Horrendous customer service. They already have a bunch of violations. It\\'s time they get another inspection. I\\'m calling the Board of Health on them.',\n",

This eclectic, trendy, yet traditional cafe is such a gem! The staff is friendly, there are plenty of tables both in and outside, and the food is oh so delicious. As a vegan, I ordered the avocado toast (no egg or cheese), a fruit salad, and an iced coffee (and found out after that they carry oat milk!!) - all BOMB - and my boyfriend was in love with his pork belly Cubano sandwich.

We started ordering drinks and as soon as she went to take our orders she spoke in Spanish which wasn\\'t a problem because in most places in the Bronx waitresses will speak to me in Spanish but usually just see what we are pointing to. My boyfriend ordered his drink and said out loud bulldog and pointed to it and I the same. The drinks came and she only gave me a bulldog and him a reg margarita. So we did not want to make a big deal we switched and thats when he noticed a rather large crack on the glass we made her aware of it and she asked \" do you want me to replace it \" . YES WE DO. The glass looked like if you held it to long it would shatter in your hand. then proceeded to order food and my boyfriend are tacos 3 steak and 3 chorizos and she looked him in his eyes and acknowledge him. and took my order. We get our food it was really good. But his chorizos tacos never came out. then when we told her she looked back at her paper like you only said 3 and I only wrote that. And I\\'m like no we told you. Finally she put the order in, around 10 mins later it came and there was a hair in the tacos. We immediately were turned off we returned them to management and all the manager kept saying was he can make new ones. I also asked another waitress for a napkin and she had no idea what I was saying until I pointed to one. The only person who could understand English was the manager And we also let him know about the broken glass. We ended up paying the bill and leaving. Only reason they got two stars was cause for a $9 margarita it was pretty good on the alcohol part.

These guys are alone in the deeper side of all the Auto Body Shops in the Hunts Point hub. And from what I noticed driving by, didn\\'t see any other Pizza shop in the area. Place is big with woods, lots of seating, refrigerators off to the left, a smaller glass ice cream freezer on right and front counter- with Pies waiting...just waiting to be heated- as soon as you head in. Really simple menu overhead: small and large Pies, square, white, Veggie slice or \"special\" pies with standard toppings, Salads and a few other things. Plain slice for me, Pepperoni for Mom and a Snapple to share. That\\'s it! Mom\\'s pepperoni slice gets props according to her, but if you\\'re making a trip to Hunts Point or swerving off the Bruckner Expressway to hit it, you\\'re grabbing a plain slice (in my opinion)--it wasn\\'t too greasy, it was crispy but still bendable, surprisingly thin and that classic (kind of) bright orange you get when that sauce-and-cheese marriage happens. Service was very nice by the way. Fratilli\\'s isn\\'t artisanal or anything like that, but our slices were good.',\n",

The food was good but there are a few things to consider.·They have opening times listed as early as 10am. I thought I could pick up something early to take to work but it wasn't to be. Their doors open at 10, but I was told food wouldn't be ready until about 11:30.·I ordered jollof rice with chofi (turkey tail). It was good, but their version of chofi wasn't turkey tail. It was most likely legs and wings cut into smaller pieces across the bone. It was good, but if turkey tail is what you're after, that's not what you may get. Also, be sure to specify what you want in your plate. Some places will ask what you want in your plate. This place didn't at the time so I ended up with a bit more shito (a spicy sauce) than I wanted.So to sum it up, tell them exactly what you want and don't expect lunch plates when they first open. Still a great place with good food at a good price.\",\n",

The whole idea of Greek/Mexican in one place sounded odd - even though lots of Mexican food (Al Pastor) is influenced by foods from Mediterranean. Also, T&S was taking over the location of another place with a strange menu.So even though I love Greek food and shawarma more than most stuff I waited and waited for some reviews to come in. Finally today I was in the area and tried it.Pork gyro platter - Excellent! This is REAL gyro/shawarma - actual slabs of meat stacked on a rotisserie and slow cooked. Most mass manufactured gyro are cones of chopped meat pressed together. In diners usually premade strips. But the gyro/shawarma at Taste and Sabor is totally homemade. Even my favorite Greek place up the hill (Greek Express) uses premade cones - which in their case are excellent - but the T&S meat is special.The pork is melt in your mouth tender and deliciously seasoned. The chicken is just as good.The rest of the platter ingredients were also excellent - fries, pita, and a really great Greek Salad with lots of vegetables and what tastes to me like REAL feta.Their tsatsiki sauce and the Greek salad dressing were also great.The deserts are really special here - all homemade and first rate. \\xa0The melomakarona cookies and bourghatsa (sp?) are new to me but so good! Baklava also excellent.Establishment and food all clean and fresh.And best of all - the people who own this place are great! Really friendly and helpful.

I honestly don\\'t understand how there are one star reviews and it is actually what motivated me to write this review. Please ignore them, as these people are actively keeping you and others from experiencing authentic tasting Korean dishes. 3 star review for an off day? Fine. 1 star? Absolutely ridiculous, offensive and damaging to a business the rest of us here in Washington Heights truly appreciate. These people need to grow up, and Yelp should consider removing their reviews for the purposes of this app\\'s integrity since I am now questioning whether I should even trust this review service anymore. Seriously - the only place you will find this chicken is IN Korea or made by an actual Korean person.Back to the food: Mandu is pretty authentic as well (mandu are Korean dumplings), Ramen is great but I don\\'t really eat ramen that much so I can\\'t really compare it to other places. My next favorite thing (after the chicken box) is the spicy pork bowl - which is very close to how my actual Korean grandmother prepares this dish. The rest of the \"bowl\" dishes are great as well, and it\\'s something my non-meat eating friends can enjoy too, since they have things like tofu. The one thing I wish they had is servings of gochujang, but you can get the chicken so spicy it\\'s not even necessary. Thank you GoGo-Gi !!!Edit: Ended up checking the rest of the reviews and noticed there\\'s another one star review that is border-line racist. Yelp, please remove these hateful comments as to allow this restaurant to rightfully thrive, and allow my neighborhood to continue enjoying our delicious chicken.

I came in craving that korean bbq flavor on my lunch hour and ordered the BBQ pork rice bowl. While the meal hit the spot in portion size, I was rather disappointed with the contents of my bowl. I didn't realize that it came with cole slaw and french fries until after I ordered, and thought that was weird, but still looked forward to it. However, for $10.50, I got a bowl of kbbq pork that was mixed with... stale crinkle-cut french fries (like the frozen ones you bake)? And then the cole slaw was pretty wet so the vinegary, mayonnaise-y juices seeped into everything else and made the rice and meat an unwelcome acidic. The cole slaw was also straight up American tasting cole slaw, not like a pickled cabbage, or anything spicy. And unfortunately, the meat itself was also too burnt so every bite had that smokey, overcooked char taste. All in all, I was sort of confused by the meal. The closest thing to it would probably be one of those chicken/beef teriyaki platters you might get in a mall food court. Maybe the other bowls are better and I might come back to try one some time in the later future.\",\n",

The fried sweet plantains were LOADED with so much grease, I could wring them out and have enough oil to refry them. Apparently, I could not eat those either! I wasted $10.00 on a nonedible meal, after not only walking to the store (over 15 minutes), but also walking to an ATM (No cash!). El Pabellon De Oro should be ASHAMED of themselves. Also, the menu is in desperate need of review and revision there are NO HEALTHY OPTIONS available. I did not want to order rice (because not everyone eats rice, or pork fried rice!), however I was told that I could not substitute the fried rice, French fries, or plantains ((everything is fried)) with broccoli or a different steamed vegetable :(. I was told that I had to choose one of those options, and if I wanted broccoli or another steamed vegetable (healthier option), I would have to order it SEPERATELY which comes with rice which is included in the price ($6.75). So, in order to eat lunch (which should be affordable) I have to order extra things that I do not want, or need AND I would have to pay EXTRA and have EXTRA food that I do not want. To end this review, I will not be visiting this establishment EVER again and do not recommend if you remotely care about your health.

First impression when I entered was bad because the only work behind the counter was on the phone and didn't pay me any mind as I stood there waiting. After 3 mins with no eye contact, I considered walking out.Out from the back walks another worker who had food in his hands. He asked me if I am staying or taking to go? Puzzled, I replied staying. He placed the food he held in his hand down on the table. At this point I'm 6 mins in and still hungry. I asked him, how much is the chicken slice? Now he became puzzled at this point.The entire time he thought I was a different customer that had on a gray jacket while I had on a navy blue coat lol. Once I realized that, I just ordered their 2 slice deal to get out of there.Memo to that staff: All African Americans don't look alike \\u200d\",\n",

Though I was initially a bit skeptical due to the yelp reviews, I had a really positive experience! We came at a time where it wasn't quite busy so the service was really friendly. Upon arriving and after being seated, you receive some warm garlic bread. It was toasty yet fluffy on the inside, so I really liked that touch. The menu was average length on the shorter side, which I personally prefer because long menus overwhelm me. For our appetizer, my parents and I ordered the stuffed plantains with shrimp. It was very delicious but lacked salt. As for our entree, my mom had the churrasco, my dad had the sirloin and I opted for the filet mignon. We all ordered it medium well and had mashed potatoes on the side. Each steak entree comes with a free side and side salad. Ordering an extra side is an addition $5. My mom ordered rice and beans on the side that was average, nothing brag worthy. We all ended up loving our food! I personally liked my filet mignon the best, but everyone's food was delicious regardless. The quality of the meat was superb and the sides were equally amazing. The only thing I had a problem with regarding my food though was that it was too small. The size of the filet mignon compared to the rest of the steaks was disproportionately smaller. Besides that, I really enjoyed my time at Willie's Steak house. I can't wait to be back again.\",\n",

It\\'s still a hotspot and after a couple of decades, that area, paved the way for a few decent restaurants- one of them being Willie\\'s Steak House. Under the L in Parkchester (Westchester & Thieriot Aves.- to be exact), still remains (a) the place to be seen, (b) see people you may haven\\'t seen and (c) run into people that you may have gone to High School or hung out with eons ago. For Parkchester standards, Willie\\'s is \"fancy\". The Man and I had an errand in the area and felt like having some Latin Caribbean food. Willie\\'s was very quiet for a Thursday, but Salsa music was playing and fortunately, kicked up the mood. Our server was pleasant and brought out the menus only to notice Seafood options, outweighed the Steak- and worked to my advantage- but isn\\'t this a Steakhouse? Mr. Man kind of questioned that, as there were all but 5 \"Steak\" dishes. He knew the food would be hearty and because this is a Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Man wanted to play it safe and ordered the Pork Chops instead- which he raved.My Camarones Enchilados (Deviled Shrimp), had the right amount of seasonings and my Tostones, were freshly fried. Full Bar but no extended cocktail menu- except for Red or White Sangria and Wine.Even though on the night we decided to visit there wasn\\'t a live Latin Jazz band, in the end, it was all about the food- which didn\\'t disappoint.',\n",

The bartenders were on point and friendly, the music was great ( we got to plug in our device but he also had a set playlist).

All solid food options, nothing that will blow you away but all good.2. Drinks - Have good happy hour specials. Haven't racked up high drinks bills due to this. 3. Atmosphere - Plenty of TVs here, so a great spot to watch the games or UFC fight. Spacious spot so I've never felt that I'm sitting on top of somebody. 4. The servers have always been nice, friendly, and attentive. Kudos to the afternoon staff the several times I've gone. 5.

After all they advertised UFC 241 all over their windows, but had pop music blasting through the fights, even up until the main card and their tv kept crashing and flickering on and off making it a pretty frustrating watching experience. Felt like they were trying to do too much, be a restaurant, bar and club all at the same time.

You can get to H.I.M Ital by hopping off 233rd on the Bronx River Pkwy then drive up from there. But I was already in the area so drove under the L which got me there quick. In a borough where Vegan is hard to find, H.I.M specializes in Grains (pasta and rice), meat substitutes (which I always pass up) and obviously- Vegetables. Looks are deceiving- noticed a small counter with a stool or two up front but seems more for takeout meals than anything else. Maybe because it was so early in the day, most of their hot foods weren't prepared yet- so decided on what was readily available- a bowl of 1/2 Kale & 1/2 Okra which was very nice. Both items were seasoned sensibly and was nice to change my palate a bit. Also noticed all their dry herbs and natural elixirs available. Sybil is so friendly and gave me info on most of the selection as well as detox beverages. In the end, price for my super healthy and hefty 2-Veggie plate plus a few ounces of detox dry Herbs, was just $11. I was all over the spirituality mindset H.I.M provides. If you're in need of a serious health reboot, go for their Caribbean Vegan food. And even if you're not Vegan and you just feel like breaking up the week with some meat free meals, this place celebrates everything Ital (Vegan).

So we pulled up around 7pm and let me tell you....straight restaurant NO PARTY. And it was relatively empty. But whatever, it\\'s still happy hour and it\\'s still a steakhouse. One thing about me, I\\'m gone eat. So we decide to indulge in the drinks and order a good meal before the party actually starts. (The restaurant did confirm that the DJ, hookah and party gets started around 9pm. The drinks were GOODT and the food was QUITE tasty. I ordered the ribeye which came with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. My homegirls had the wings, burrito and garlic & olive oil pasta. We all devoured as much as we could and had more for leftovers.Now for the party. Once the DJ came it was on & poppin. The bar was \"cash only\" (if you paid with a card it was a 2 drink minimum) but the vibe was on point. People were dancing, still eating & drinking, smoking hookah and enjoying the ambiance. Crowd was about 25-40 so def grown and sexy vibes. But overall, thumbs up from me.',\n",

If you are familiar with this area do you know what is surrounding everything in this area that could possibly bring the wrong crowd into this establishment. I've been here three times the bartenders are OK. I don't ever eat the food when I come but I did eat some wings the last time and they were OK. The hookah can be very harsh and burns out quickly if you seem like you don't know how a hookah should function then they may Scam you out of the first $30 so you can keep refilling it for $20. A hookah refill is $20 in an area like this; that is pretty pricey especially for the type of crowd that this place brings in. It's unfortunate because it's a really cute spot but it's a very small spot so when situations occur, fights really destroy the entire night and it shuts down. Yes I said grown people over 25 years old still coming outside to fight. I went last Saturday and as soon as we refilled two hookahs; not even 60 seconds afterwards an massive fight broke out (knocking over peoples drinks and hookahs) which caused the entire lounge to shut down. You can bet we are pretty peeved to just loose $40 like that. Not to mention being someone with a career and having to worry about being in establishment with a group of people over 25 years old and the cops have to run inside of it and shut it down.\"},\n",

I ordered the panda special #2- general tsos with chicken and broccoli with fried rice and wontons. The general tso was just ok, the chicken from the broccoli section was chewy and the sauce was practically soy so salty as heck. The fried wontons were the best part but hard to mess that up. The fried rice needed flavor but mixed it with the general tso's sauce so that helped.

And he was like \"well it\\'s happy hour and that would be past the time\". \\xa0I just felt it was all a bit pedantic. I mean it was also confusing as a concept because I did call well before 7 pm... like for example, if there\\'s a lunch special that runs from 11 am-3:30 pm, I would expect that if I called at 3:15, I \"made the cut\" as I\\'m clearly placing the order well before the final time. Well, it seems like this establishment clearly values saving $2-3 over making a customer happy but the associate did just speak to me matter of factly and not in a rude tone, which I did appreciate at least. I\\'ll probably forget about it and just go back in some time because I do love their cheese fries for $4.95... I just feel the burgers are overly priced especially for being in the Bronx and also because the size of the burger is average (similar size as Shake Shack), but the price point is higher.',\n",

It was surprisingly busy for a weekday lunch, but the owner of the restaurant was greeting everyone and walking around talking to and helping all of the diners along with the waiter. The owner told us that their home recipes were from her grandmother!We started with a generous portion of complimentary japchae noodles with vegetables. Then, we ordered a beef bibimbap and the shrimp dumplings lunch specials. As she and the waiter were bringing out our dishes, the owner asked us whether we were planning on sharing (which we were), and she brought out new dishes for us to use.The bibimbap came as a large bowl of beef with vegetables (bean sprouts, mushrooms, sliced carrots, some sort of spiralized vegetable, beef, fresh cucumbers, cucumber salad, and spinach) and a sunny-side-up egg with gochujang and a bowl of rice for each of us on the side. The dumplings were served with potatoes and a salad and came with soy sauce, and then furthermore, we received cucumber salad, kimchi, pickled cabbage. It was a really nice spread of refreshing food that was tasty but not too heavy--perfect for a hot day! (Next time, I might get the shrimp dumplings steamed rather than fried because the filling is flavorful enough that they probably don't need an oil-fried exterior to be delicious.) The portions were so generous that we wound up taking a bunch of food home, and our waiter packaged everything up separately and neatly for us.We actually came to Hometown Dumpling to scope it out as a potential place to get food to bring to my grandparents, and it definitely passed the test. I would recommend this place for a tasty, (reasonably) healthy meal--just come hungry or be prepared to save leftovers! :)\",\n",

There is outdoor seating but we opted for inside, there is a lot of seating and the place has a nice ambiance with nice art on the walls. When we got there we were the only ones there since it was just after 12, the food options are good you have both Peruvian and Mexican appetizers and entrees, they have a drink menu with both types of beer, cocktails etc. We were given chips and dip when we sat down which came with salsa and green Peruvian sauce it was a nice touch. For entrees my fiancé ordered Mexican chicken enchiladas and I ordered, Peruvian bistec a la pobre, we both liked our dishes but didn't find it amazing. I didn't try the drinks and there were a few things on the menu I'd come back to try but honestly with so many Mexican and Peruvian places nearby I have found other places that make either cuisine better but this is a good place if you're with a group that's not sure which kind they would like, plenty of options here with good service.\",\n",

The salsa was nice and smoky and the chips weren't fresh out the oil but they were good. I ordered the Barbacoa tacos (the goat...they also have beef). My boyfriend ordered the steak tacos. Let me just say that they give you a huge amount of meat in each taco. They have a $9 special for three tacos and I could only eat two. The goat in my tacos was very tender and I thoroughly enjoyed them with some lime and pickled onions (yes I added more onions on top of the onions already on the taco...so what) which they give you on the side to add. \\xa0I tried my boyfriend's tacos and I liked the steak better. The flavor was better, but honestly both were good. We also ordered juice. I had tamarindo and bae had fresh pressed OJ. The juice was good as well. The music they were playing was great, a lot of Spanish trap (which I like). The service was prompt and our waiter was nice and our total check came to $27. Not bad at all!

I'd say leave stroller in the car. We also had to ask for a place setting and plate for the baby. Eventually our waitress caught on; she brought more napkins as she saw it was a messy experience lol.Only issue for me was that I was expecting to have a nice strong margarita and they dont serve liquor. They have beer and wine but no tequila shots or margaritas.....they have pina coladas but only virgin. We chose their fountain drink options...it was a purple drink that had tamarind and...I forgot lol but it was really good; reminded me of sorrel but not as strong. No issues with the food. I had a beef burrito that was huge and seasoned to perfection. The guac, chips and salsa are addictive. The fish tacos were also tasty. They bring you a tray of various styles of hot sauce. One had thinly sliced habaneros and onions in a vinegar sauce. Mmmm fire!!! No seriously straight up chugging water and sucking on ice hot. I would come back because the meal was perfect.\",\n",

I've only tried the tacos, but the they are so good!The service here can be a bit slow during lunch since there is only one waitress, so if you're in a rush, make sure to ask for the check ASAP. However, the anticipation is WORTH IT. I really like the pollo asado tacos as well as the carnitas (although I'm sure EVERY taco here is delicious). The meat in the carnitas is soooo soft; a bit fatty, but IT REALLY HITS THE SPOT when you've been sitting in an office for 5 hours!!!Some of the tacos say $3.50 in price, but if you order them with everything on it (sour cream, tomatos, lettuce, etc.), they come out to $4.00 on the bill.All in all, if you are in the area, I would DEFINITELY give this place a try.\",\n",

And it gets even better than that their heroes range from 3-5 dollars, isn't that unbelievable? You would think that if the prices are so cheap the food would be bad, but it's the opposite!

Absolutely no flavor besides soy sauce. Do not order the rice! What makes me sooo mad was that my fried rice was BURNT! Every bite I took, theres a piece of burnt pieces in my mouth.

Very kind. On our most recent visit we sat in- *pretty late in the night*, they did not have Pinot Grigio, so my first Chardonnay was on the house AND when we ordered a small pork fried rice to-go, they sent us home with a large and did not charge us, at all.

That said, they were out of another dish we had wanted to try - pork soup dumplings. \\xa0Odd for a Friday night, prime time. I ordered Hot & Sour soup - it never came. I had to ask multiple times for water and when our main dish, a simple cantonese Happy Family platter arrived, it was served with a tiny bowl of rice for 3 people. I asked for more rice and found later that I was charged for that. Shame on them! The dish itself was meh, at best. There was a single piece of lobster, overcooked and too tough to chew. The broccoli was good, but stalks were tough. The scallops and shrimp were passable and the steak pieces, plentiful and delicious. Overall, a disappointingly mediocre meal from a place we usually enjoy. In fact, I wouldn\\'t be writing this if it weren\\'t for the prices being so much higher and the added charge just to have an adequate amount of rice for the table.

When I was a Bronx Science student from 2006-2010, this is the very guy that initiated me to halal cart food. Back in the day, we had a few mobile vendors around. Kenny's and the Ghetto Truck were the most prominent examples. Then came Ned's on the Goulden Avenue. Those served American fare and coffee. Now Tony's offered that speck of variety we all needed. First, the meat was chopped into fine pieces each morsel filled with flavor. I remembered there was chicken or gyro meat served over I presume basmati rice. That's also served with the complimentary salad. And there was that usual white and hot sauce. That hot sauce was insanely hot and I then had very little tolerance to it. We usually tempered it with BBQ sauce. On Fridays, he gave out a free drink to students. And the guy has a great memory for faces, which puts smiles on his customers. Very chill and laid back. Unfortunately, with the kind of service and food quality, Tony's set such a high bar of expectations that very few carts elsewhere meet it. Even years after I last visited, I'm joyed to see that his cart has a listing and so many people having the same views. It's a worthy trip down memory lane and I thank Tony and his crew, and the other Yelpers for bringing these past memories back into mind.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Tombolinos sits at the busy corner of Kimball and Yonkers Avenues. Parking seems somewhat limited -- a couple of unmarked spots just in front of the restaurant and metered street parking along Yonkers Ave. Inside, one is welcomed by a newly redecorated dining area with soft lighting, linen-clad tables, a wooden showcase and an alarmingly large TV that is sometimes distracting. We were the first dinner reservation for the evening and had the attention of the hostess, the new waitress and the restaurant manager for most of the evening. Water and bread were provided right away, and we were early enough to enjoy the mid-week happy hour prices which included $5 glasses of wine and reduced prices on appetizers. We selected the Burrata ($10) and two glasses of Cabernet to start. I typically love Burrata-based appetizers, as it's hard to improve upon the gooey, creamy, rich pulled curd cheese. The cheese was served room temp and covered in a sweet balsamic reduction with cracked pepper, but the sliced tomato bed it sat on was hard and icicle cold, clearly just out of the fridge, and perhaps out of season. Sourcing good tomatoes during the winter can be a challenge, but serving them at the same temperature as the cheese requires just a little forethought. Our waitress was a young woman who was new to the restaurant and still learning the menu. She was however, extremely attentive and professional, as were all the staff that served us that evening. We really appreciated their vigilant, yet unobtrusive presence that ensured we didn't lack for anything throughout our dinner. A few small things that were a little disruptive to our experience: the music being piped in overhead was punctuated by loud commercials. The dining area we were in had a giant TV just behind us with sports playing. I would have preferred a more formal setting with fewer distractions.Although we spent some time looking through the menu, two of the specials presented to us caught our attention and we decided to give them a chance. The broiled leg of lamb served with risotto ($27) and an Agnolotti served with a Bolognese sauce ($22). The lamb was near perfect - tender, moist and falling off the bone, and the side of risotto was light, fluffy and mildly creamy. The stuffed pasta was also tasty, finished with a sweet tomato sauce and enhanced by the delicate flavor of truffle oil. Of course, a little Parmesan and cracked pepper on top is nearly irresistible on any dish. There were a few minor mistakes with the menu but these were totally forgivable as the waitress was in training and the kitchen resolved these issues quickly - almost not worth mentioning due to the excellent service.For dessert we were tempted by the tiramisu. This rendition was forward on the coffee flavor, but extremely watery. More so than any other version I've had. Tasty none-the-less, but I would have preferred an execution that was either a little more syrupy or a little drier. It was very nicely plated with a beautiful herringbone-patterned cream/chocolate/raspberry coulis on the side. We enjoyed our dining experience at Tombolinos and would definitely come back again.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I don't know about you- but I've had my share of 'Italian' food done wrong. So when I look for an 'Italian' restaurant, that bad boy better be breathing Italian from top to bottom. And not anything else passing off as Italian. So Boom...Agostino's in New Rochelle is it! All I wanted to do after we finished with Mother's Day Brunch at my Mom's- was head home and nurse my cold. A day later, my husband left it up to me to let him know where to celebrate my post-Mother's Day. Agostino's caught my eye really good. Plus supporting- not only an Italian restaurant through and through, but Woman-Owned and Chef also- Anna Catalano was up there on my list. Agostino's is unmistakably one of those, 'don't judge a book by its cover'- because inside, is all the rage (at least for me it was)- it was like Grandma put her stamp on it (but not in a tacky way)! Wall-to-Wall Mirrors, black picture frame cream Wainscoting, eggshell-color walls and that soft lighting (could've been dimmed a bit more). This was a personal recipe for visual charm at that moment. It's a bit out of the way for us, but Italian-owned restaurants in the White Plains area are almost nil. But Agostino's is a different breed of Italian which I wanted- so dining here to having amazing Italian food- was a slam dunk. Picture the vibe: laughter, loud and happy. And if you're into your Appetizer, Entree and Dessert coming out at a mile a minute- Agostino's ain't it. I reserved for 7pm Thursday Dinner and we were out closed to 9:30. This is all about enjoying the evening at a slow and steady pace. Our server was smooth, had a strong Italian accent and tackled a few tables at a time. I'll be honest, I was a bit dazed in the beginning with her almost being a one-woman-show on the floor- but I guess this is just how they flow. Started with a simple and good 'Mozzarella/ Yellow Cherry Tomatoes Bites' with dressed Arugula. FYI: full bar but not sure if there's a Cocktail menu. I stuck with Rosé while hubby had Sangiovese. Broiled Branzino was delicately seasoned with a bit of Garlic and salt and Sautéed Garlic Broccoli made an excellent low-carb dinner. Hubby's Medium Rare Filet Mignon- was done precisely as he requested. But after we placed our order, I broke my Keto regimen and went all in for the Pasta. It crossed my mind and thought I didn't come all this way and not have pasta. I mean...THIS IS an Italian restaurant after all! Sure enough, ordered a side of Linguine with Tomato Sauce. Pasta was divine and Tomato Sauce itself- was out of this world simple. Nothing I hate most than having over seasoned tomato sauce. Food was very tasty with an almost old-school touch. Honestly, Agostino's is a nice blockbuster and drew us in quick.\",\n",

My family's favourite location is in the Bronx, near Westchester Square (specifically on Tremont which is an important factor as there are two in the area). Imagine our surprise when we found out that one of our fave foodie spots set up a brick and mortar in our 'hood?! We actually had a chance to pop in after dining in the area and took the opportunity to grab one of their take away menus and a card that had their delivery info with a 10% discount off the first order.Well, today we decided to order in so I whipped out that discount card and we started to enter our order. When it came time to enter a discount code, I noticed that the card had no code printed on it. After calling up to inquire, the gentleman I spoke to said that it's the company's fault that there is not code which I found otdd because it wasn't a card from any company like Grubhub, Seamless, etc. The url is the restaurant name so that didn't really make any sense. We just ended up ordering through Grubhub and calling it a day.Deliver was fast. The food came within 30 minutes which is great. Unfortunately, it looks as though they send the food by bike and I'm guessing that our delivery guy bit it enroute because a lot of our food containers were smashed and we ended up having to eat our food on top of the plastic bags in which the containers were carried. One other thing that peeved the hell out of me was that I specified and requested in the app that they please call and not ring the be because we have an infant and two dogs but the guy still rang the bell which sent my dogs into a frenzy and completely frustrated the hell out of my 8 month old daughter with all the loud noise.Grub Rundown:Churros - Best thing I ate. They were still warm so, of course I started to eat them first. They're served with both a caramel and strawberry sauce. Excellent.Shrimp Enchiladas Suizas - My go to dish whenever I visit EPIV. These were lacking so much. They were stuck to the container, they were bland and they were way smaller than the ones I get at the other location.Tamales - I had the Chile & Cheese which tasted good but the Chicken type was kind of dry and bland.Chipotle Chicken Chimichanagas - Hubby ordered this and liked it a lot.Rice & Beans - Both of our dishes came with this as a side dish but the rice was very undercooked and both of our containers were smashed, which caused the beans to ooze out all over the other four containers.Guacamole Side - Not worth it. They charge $4 for a container that holds three tablespoons and again, it's bland.Not ordering from this loc again. Too many things happened in this one delivery for me to give them another shot. I'd rather drive to the northeast Bronx for a better tasting meal. Many items seriously lacked salt and id rather wait an extra ten minutes if that means my food will make it to my home with lost of it in the containers and not plastered all over the bags. They have a lot to work on but they've only just opened, so maybe they'll do better.\",\n",

So to wrap up our night, wanted to revisit and pick up a few items before heading home. Can\\'t comment on getup as my husband actually went inside. But I can attest- even looking from where we parked, they ditched their signature blues and whites from way back when- and went for a warmer touch. It was a good 20 minute wait for Shrimp Scampi, Mofongo de Camarones, white rice, Tostones and Pink Stew Beans- which wasn\\'t bad at all. According to Mr. Man, service was fine- considering the many reviews complaining about rudeness (and among other things). But that wasn\\'t the case and then again, all he did was an in and out visit to pick up at the counter. He did mention, the lady tending to our order, was very apologetic that Marisco Centro ran out of Mojo for Tostones. What??? What do you mean you ran out of Mojo in a Dominican restaurant? I was so dazed and confused, I wasn\\'t even upset- in fact, I was cracking up. But a couple of things annoyed me: from door-to-door, it\\'s about a 30-minute drive heading up to White Plains from Soundview and its surrounding areas. By the time we got home, Tostones were limp and I sure know our 30-minute drive up, wasn\\'t the cause for soggy fried plantains. Furthermore, Dominicans know Tostones like the back of our hands and these weren\\'t fresh or crispy and seemed old like they\\'ve been refried and refried some more. Price? I know Marisco Centro is perhaps the only seafood restaurant on the Castle Hill Ave. strip but damn.......prices were just brutal for the area. And forget about the Tostones- that was another arm and a leg. My 8 medium \"Shrimp Scampi\"- $22.95 and my husband\\'s \"Camarofongo\" with garlic sauce and about 5 Shrimp, ran up at the same price also. What??? In Castle Hill? To put it mildly though, our entrees tasted good, White Rice was perfectly done and Pink Stewed Beans- Lord...hold me back.

It was a busy day. We got our order and headed back home. My boyfriend quickly checked to see if we had everything and thought we did so we left. When we got home, I noticed that instead of giving us a full-sized salad, we had been given a half-sized one and our sides were missing. Frustrated, we drove back to the location, which is about 15 minutes away from us. When my boyfriend went to the Rapid Pick-Up area to explain to staff that part of our order was missing, no one apologized for the mistake. One of the staff members told another \"See! I told you!\" And they had the nerve to smile and laugh about it, like it was a joke. We were given the other half of the salad. I had to ask for our sides because they forgot those as well. Funny thing is that there on the wall is lettering that says if they get your order wrong, you get a free treat. Not only did we not get an apology, we didn\\'t get a free treat either! We also noticed that the food didn\\'t taste as good as it usually does. Some of my lettuce was wilted and turning brown. Also, the pack of chocolate cookies we ordered from the bakery were stale.Sadly, this isn\\'t the first time that a mistake has been made regarding our orders. The past 4-5x that I\\'ve asked for salad dressing on the side when we dine-in, someone forgets to pack it on the tray so I have to go to the Rapid Check-Out area to ask for my dressing. We also stopped ordering bakery items when we dine in because the last several times we did order them, no one brought them out and when we mentioned it to the servers, we were told that we have to pick them up at the bakery, which defeats the whole purpose of ordering it while dining in. They used to bring bakery items to the table before so what changed?I\\'ll say this...the servers are always really kind and friendly. We\\'ve never had a problem with them. The staff in the Rapid Pick-Up area? Eh. I always feel like I\\'m being ignored when I approach them to ask for my salad dressings. I highly doubt we\\'ll be returning. At this point, we might as well go to the Panera that is closest to us.',\n",

I was very disappointed in both. The gyro barley had any filling. When you cut the meat it should be in slices not chopped up and heated on the flattop to warm up. It only dries out the meat. Suggestion would be to have a squeeze bottle with chicken stock handy. I missed not having the strips of meat, chopped lettuce with raw onion and chopped tomato. My gyro was very lite on filling. The spinach square had very little filling of spinach & feta cheese. It was also very greasy. It would be better to be made in a pie pan fill it and make it high not flatten like road kill. I've Been a chef all my life and Presentation, Aroma and taste is very important. After eating my takeout I looked at the check. I was charged $1 for Tzatziki sauce and it was less than 2oz given in a 2oz soufflé cup. The portions are small for high prices. You need to increase the portion and you'll sell more making more money. The menu is limited so they need to perfect what the have. I'll try again in 4 months and see what happens after they perfect their menu.\",\n",

I wanted a fresh cake so I got there early so as not to buy it from the bodega a few doors down. Years ago I never had a problem with that either, but the cake has changed. As I said below, I think they changed the recipe. It's dry, not creamy, a tough crust. I got a rock hard frozen cake that was dry, crumbly, stiff. I can't believe it. Why, for the love of all things holy, would you change this cheesecake?This cheesecake is as iconic as... Katz's pastrami. And Gertels Delancey Russian Coffee Cake. I don't like Juniors. I don't like the layer of cake at the bottom. I buy their cheese pie, as they call it, with pineapple on it, to get the creamy texture. It's still a far cry from the original S& S cheesecake. Please, S&S, change back to your original recipe. This is very sad. Please. I don't want to lose yet another N.Y. iconic food. Please. We beg you. ************Have they changed their recipe? I have loved S&S for years. Very creamy, wet. You could taste the cream cheese of this cake. It was velvety, very soft. It was instantly recognizable. Very rich but with a light, fluffy, bright taste. It stood apart from the rest. Today mine is drier. Crumbly. And the flavor is not present. Mind you, it is still good, if someone never had S&S before this. This would be a very good cake. But if you remember S&S as I do, you wouldn't believe it. If someone placed a slice of this on a plate, you wouldn't say, That's S&S! I hope they return to their old recipe or method. Are they baking it a tad too long? Is it reduced fat cream cheese? Has a supplier changed without telling them? Baking is a science and one small change can make all the difference. Please find out.

I found this on Yelp while in the area, and I was interested in exploring what a simple-looking Brazilian BBQ buffet would look like, and I was not disappointed. When you walk in, all you have to do is grab a plate and start loading food onto your plate from the trays. Before the meats, they have your standard array of salads and sides, including different rice, bean options, as well as things like plantains and yucca fries. This part is already pretty good, and they come with rotating specials (I believe) if that's all you want. I had the fried fish from this section, and it was awesome.After that, you can order BBQ meats one-by-one, which are spinning on the rotisserie the whole time. They have a variety of beef, chicken, and pork options, and I have confident that all of them are excellent after what I got to sample. When I went, I got the pork sausage, (beef) short rib, and flank steak. I'm a huge sausage fan and not too picky, so I liked the sausage a lot. The short rib was pretty incredible, and I recommend eating it all down to the bone. The flank steak was maintained at a nice medium rare, which I thought was really impressive, and the effort certainly pays off. The only thing I might recommend is adding some seasoning yourself (a pinch of salt perhaps) or anything else to your taste. The meats are fresh and prime for customization in my opinion.Though this place can be a trek for many (including myself), I think it's definitely worth the trip if you're looking to explore no frills Brazilian BBQ at your own pace. I wish I arrived more ready to engorge myself with meat, but I guess that means I'll just have to come back.\",\n",

The cafe has your standard array of coffee and espresso drinks, but shines in its specialty and seasonal drinks that it swaps out every few months. I tried a summer matcha beverage -- it was matcha, a touch of honey, and a shot of espresso. The drink was exceptionally well balanced between the earthiness of the matcha, the acidity of the espresso, and just the right amount of honey sweetness. Although I was heading to a brunch, I couldn\\'t avoid trying the \"Sir Muffington\" -- an earl gray carrot cake muffin with chocolate chips, orange marmalade, and a crumble topping. The muffin was potentially the best I\\'d ever had -- an extremely moist carrot-forward muffin was exceptionally accented by a taste of earl grey and sweetened by chocolate chunks. The muffin was extremely unique and very fresh; I can\\'t wait to head back to try whatever Fall varietals they throw our way.Dear Mama has great sitting spots in the form of one large family-style table, several two-tops, as well as some couches and more comfortable seating towards the back of the cafe.

Worth the walk and truly excited for the delicious lunch I was about to enjoy, I got back to my desk ready to eat and let me tell you, I ate that lunch out of spite. I ate because I had no other choices and because I paid for it. It was so sad looking, so flavorless and lacking.There was no sesame brown sauce, there was no garlic (and garlic flavor is not hard to add I think we all know), there were a ton of bean sprouts and a nice piece of chicken but no scallions. Everything looked like it was just thrown into my container carelessly without a thought about the enjoyment of eating & taste. Now, I\\'m left in a funk because I love the rich flavors of Thai food and their food is lacking severely in that regard. Every single time I\\'ve come here the food has been bland. What a waste of my lunch money and lunch hour.I\\'d recommend KinKhao Thai on 2200 Amsterdam Ave. for better flavor- note it has no where to enjoy indoors and its more of a pickup place.

I've had this latte in the past and had it made to go and it was divine. However, this time it was delivered 10 minutes later and the cup was only half full. I asked why because if I'm paying $4 for a latte, I at least want the cup to be full. Again, this was not a problem in the past. The bartender must've been new, which is fine, but when I asked about why my cup wasn't full, she said that's the small size. She said she could add more milk. I don't know why the small size is put into a large to-go cup. The event was nearly over and there was no reason for me to have this latte anymore so I decided to close out the check. This is the part that really surprised me. The woman talks to a co-worker about my actions in front of me (Nevermind the customer always being right policy), tells him that she made the latte the correct size, and stormed off. She could've asked what size I wanted before making the latte, or at least not given me half a cup. When she gave my my card back after paying for the rest of the bill, she slammed it down so hard and scoffed away. All of this being said, the lattes here are great. Just make sure you clarify you want the cup full. UPDATE- 2 months later. I came back to show a friend how great the lattes are. Unfortunately that same worker who talked badly about me right in front of me was still behind the bar so we ran out immediately.\",\n",

Soft and crumbly feta! Food is the highlight here. But it's also clean and casual. Water and pita with marinated olives were brought to the table as I was seated. I could have eaten all the olives but I had to resist. The chicken souvlaki platter was huge! It comes with a ton of delicious juicy chicken, rice or fries, pita and tzatziki (so yummy), and a Greek salad with a perfect slab of feta cheese. It is not tomato season but the tomatoes on the salad were so red and perfect, just like in Greece. The menu can be overwhelming because there's everything Greek you can imagine - Mediterranean overload in the best way possible. Waited a bit to get my check, but was nice not to be rushed through a mid afternoon lunch. Will be back to try a comfort food like moussaka next.\",\n",

The first time, I got general tso's chicken. I found it sort of bland and soggy. Not impressed. Then, since I read the reviews and figured it was more of a Vietnamese place, my husband and I went for pho the second time around. Still, not impressed. So we decided Moon Star was a miss for us.A friend who lives nearby though swears by Moon Star and said we had to give it another shot and order the chicken with broccoli. Which I thought was a little weird, since that's such like a basic thing, how amazing could it be?So third times a charm, we got the chicken and broccoli and decided to try the scallion pancake rolled with beef 'cause the picture on yelp looked good. Turns out that was the right call. The broccoli was perfectly cooked, still had a crunch to it. The chicken too was great, not soggy, not springy like I've had at other Chinese restaurants. And the scallion pancake was flakey, and the beef delicious (though I didn't care for the sauce it came with -- would have been better with a hoisin). That's now our order at Moon Star. I give it 4 stars because those 2 things are so damn good, but knocked off one because that's the only thing we've found that we've actually liked.\",\n",

My favorites are the flor de calabaza taco, flor de calabaza quesadilla (great hand made tortilla!) and the chiles rellenos. The decor is kitschy in a charming way. They seem to change it once a month to match the season. The servers are also charming, and their cheery demeanors fit well with the decor. The prices are great too. Generally, paying $10-$15 here on food will get your stomach full and give you leftovers for tomorrow.

With 3 waiters and the owner hustling around plus a girl at the front I would have expected better. Slower that the last shit I took to be honest.Our menus we given to us when we sat down and a little while later the waiter takes our drink order. The drink arrives at the table and then at least 15 minutes pass until he takes our order. That's where it went down hill. It took FOREVER for our appetizer and main courses to come. At least come and check on us in between. The two hardest working people were the owner and the bus boy.I might give them another try as like I said, the food was very good. We shall see.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"There's one primary reason that this place deserves five stars. And I'm pretty damn picky. It's because the food is consistently good--like having your mom cook food for you the way you like all the time. The owner comes from a family of cooks and has been cooking her entire life, and she's just an amazingly sweet and lovely woman. If that's not enough for you to have a host that cooks consistently well and greet you with a smile consistently then I don't know what the heck you're looking for when you go out to eat. From my perspective there are only two reasons to go out to eat: 1) to get food that you normally can't get at home.2) to be waited on and served in such a way that you want to return to a place.The Barbecue Pit is far, far more than just barbecue. From their samosas, to their fried chicken, to their lentil soup, and Mediterranean and Indian fare, there's nothing this amazing woman can't cook. If you're looking for a place you can trust that you're going to be well received and well fed for a very fair price, don't just do take out, come here and sit in. It's cozy, it's friendly, and it's delicious. How do I know all this? Because I think I've eaten here about 40+ times. I live in New York City, I go out to eat all the time, but there are some places that you just call home and go to when you need a consistently delicious meal.\",\n",

The restaurant only has a handful of tables but it wasn't packed for lunch so we had plenty of room. We started with the spinakopita and the zucchini croquettes. \\xa0I didnt know zucchini croquettes were a greek thing but I went with it. They are served with tzatziki and were pretty good. They had a crunchy exterior and didn't taste oily even though they were fried. The spinakopita was very think and looked like it wasn't as fresh as I would expect. I know this because the dough wasn't flaky or crisp. The flavor was actually pretty good though so not the worse thing in the world.For lunch I ordered the halloumi salad since I am half cypriot and love that halloumi is popping up everywhere now. For those who dont know halloumi is a cypriot cheese that is grilled or sauteed and holds together well. It is a little salty and has a high melting point so it stays together well. The acidic dressing complimented the cheese and the freshness of the greens brought it all together.It was a quick lunch and I enjoyed it. The service was prompt with no frills.

I liked this a lot but I'm sure it tastes way better if eaten in the restaurant, straight from the kitchen.Hummus - the color threw me off but the flavor is completely on point. They gave us so much warm pita for everything. We really wanted for nothing.Octopus - I took a chance ordering the octopus for take out from a place I've never eaten but after all of the rave reviews, I had to try it out. I'm glad I did.

Seems like this spot is buzzing right in this part of Soundview- feet away from the 6.Service is pleasant all around. Our server even made sure to warn us about the Salsa \\'being real spicy\\' (turned out it wasn\\'t- thank you Jesus!). Music added another upbeat layer with Mexican Pop. My Mom loved her Mexican coffee with hints of Cinnamon but my Tamarind Juice, was bland. Menu has lots to choose from and decided on Shrimp Tacos. Unlike me, my Mom, can stomach any type of meat and settled on a Bistec (Steak) with a Sope and Grilled Cactus. My 3 tasty Shrimp Tacos, were packed real nice with queso, Cilantro and lettuce- and I was in flavor heaven when I added a squeeze of lime to them. Mumsy took notice that our Lunch came out too quick- including her Steak. Unfortunately, my Mom complained (in Spanish) that her Steak \"felt like a piece of rubber\". Hey, can\\'t control what the lady says. Anyhow.....It was a nice Shrimp Taco bliss for me. Just kind of wished, my Mom had a similar experience like I did- with her Entree. They have several things going for them- they just need to put more priority on food quality. I\\'m going with a 3 and a 1/2 on this one. There aren\\'t many Mexican restaurants in Soundview and I think Vista deserves some kind of a shout.',\n",

One day, when you and your bros aren't too busy absolutely crushing it, it is imperative you assemble the squad and ride out to Merryland.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I was originally attracted to this buffet because of their $4 take out deal. At their 149th street location, they had a variety of food and for just $4 you could buy as much food that you could fit in the plastic container plus you got a free can of soda. Great lunch deal if you ask me.I was in the Fordham area today with my sister, since we were super hungry, decided to give this location a try. As a lot of the other reviewers say, the tables here are way too close to each other. Not only that, but the hostess purposely gives you a table right next to other people even though there are empty group of tables on the other side. The location itself is actually quite small too. Don't get me wrong, they have a wide selection of food and even dessert. My sister and I paid $18.50 to dine in. I guess you get what you pay for. You pay upon entering if you're eating there and then you can have as much food as you want for one hour. Plus as much soft drinks (soda) as you want as well. Now if you're buying food to take out you get all the food then you pay. They have about three different size containers with different prices. The $4 deal is also offered here.  I'm a huge fan of their food selections - ranging from shrimp, veggie fried rice, fried chicken, plátanos maduros to even dessert!!! But I think I'll probably stick to the Hub location, great concept but location is too small for me.\",\n",

And the decor in this place is fresh and really pretty. We don't normally order any starters unless something screams out at us, figuring we'll share main dishes instead. We got the cochinita pibil tacos along with the carnitas tacos, 4 altogether being that one order of tacos only brings 2. Both tacos consisted of pork meat. Both just deliciously smothered in some crazy tasty sauce. We loved them but wished we had more. Next came the chicken enchiladas Suizas style. You can chose different sauces. \\xa0Our enchiladas were very good. Succulent white meat only with just the right amount of salsa verde on the outside but maybe 2 slivers of the cheese that is supposed to go with it. And to add to that awful surprise, we only had 2 enchiladas on our plate. \\xa0Everywhere I've been to and ordered tacos or enchiladas, I've been served 3 of each. 3 tacos, 3 enchiladas etc. This place however only served 2 of each. We would be ok with that only when it was time to pay our bill, we noticed a $2 charge for ordering the Suizas style enchiladas because apparently much like guac, cheese is extra. Another thing that really turned us off was the amount of noise at this particular restaurant. Wow! \\xa0Patrons at the bar screaming over loud music. We couldn't hold a conversation so we texted each other instead. Quite romantic for our 2nd wedding anniversary dinner. We will however be back for happy hour as we really enjoyed our drinks, overpriced as they were. My main complaint here is the lack of food for the price.

There was no apology with this discuss either. With the hundreds of Chinese restaurants in this area and NYC alone, this is no big deal to let them go. But don't make our mistake in being loyal to a business that is not loyal to their customers.\"},\n",

He was so willing to explain each dish to me in such a warm and friendly manner. I explained that I usually get the Shami kabob and he suggested that I try some of their more popular dishes. I told him that I am familiar with many Pakistani dishes and he said that he had something in mind for me. He brought out some of the best tasting Papadoms, a crispy fried wafer with various vegetables, and I was very impressed. I bought their Chicken Bihari Kabab, Chicken Jalfrezi, and plain Naan. For dessert, I got the Kheer. Boy, did I make the right decision going to this place. Everything was seasoned just right. The flavors are so complex yet very satisfying. Although you would want to eat more and gorge yourself because of the flavor, a little goes a long way.

Excellent sauce combined with the octopus and potato; highly recommended.The plantains are sweet yet crispy, with a bit of saltiness from the sprinkle of cheese. Definitely a good side for sharing.Finally, the Pork Chaufa was a disappointment. It's heavy with fat and incredibly salty, and has large chunks of pork fat with skin attached. These are too large to eat in one bite and the bowl is not conducive to cutting with a knife, so the meat on these is a little hard to get off easily. Overall the salt and fat overwhelm the dish so I would not recommend it.Overall a restaurant with excellent food for the most part. Worth a trip for sure, though I would avoid the Pork Chaufa.\",\n",

Without cash, we decided to find a place on Seamlessweb. The only Chinese place that delivers to our apartment on Seamless was China Wok. 4* reviews there...(this is why folks, always check with YELP before trusting reviews on SEAMLESS) so I\\'m like ok...well can\\'t be that bad. We were hungry so forgot to check yelp. We ordered 2 dishes and a qrt of home made ice tea. Delivery took about 35 minutes. Ok so far so good. The horror begins when we took out our food and realized...NO HOME MADE ICE TEA! So I called the restaurant and let them know what had happened. Asked for a refund for the ice tea: \"no refunds\". Asked for them to return with the ice tea: \"Delivery man is very busy tonight, we will give you free ice tea next time you order.\" OK..alright..maybe i\\'ll do that (at this point I\\'m so tired and hungry I didn\\'t really care). Here\\'s what got me all fired up...my Thai spicy basil beef dish was 80% junk VEGETABLES and 20% tiny pieces of beef strips. I had never had such bad Chinese food EVER. It was rather pathetic. Made me think that they ran out of beef so they cut my beef into tiny tiny pieces and covered it with onions, peppers, mushrooms. By now, I\\'m pissed. I called them up and asked them if they had given me the right dish because I didn\\'t order mixed vegetables with beef...They said, it\\'s the right one and that they doubled checked. I said, why is there so much more vegetables, like 80% more than the main ingredient. Their response? Of course there is going to be more vegetables than meat anywhere you order. WOW. That was the last straw. I immediately called up seamless and let them know what happened. At first they gave me a meager 15% off my next order. I explained to them that that was unacceptable. How would you like it if you had a bad day and you have to come back to eat a plate of takeout that was 80% filled with nasty vegetables with the tiniest pieces of beef? After that, they resorted to give me a refund of my order minus the delivery fees and tip. Much better than the 15% off. Point of my review: China Wok? NEVER AGAIN.',\n",

Probably 3rd grade. And it was terrible lol.I'm so glad I took a chance on this spot.Initially I thought $10 for a small sandwich (The Slop Drop and Roll) was a little steep, but it's actually the right portion size without being too much food and tasted amazing. The perfect combination of a soft bun, seasoned beef, sauces and cheese. And the jalapeno popper and fresh jalapenos added a crunch and texture that definitely took the sloppy joe to a new level. I was here on a Monday afternoon so there was no line, but if this place was open late on the weekends it would be well patronized with the post-casino/bar/club crowd. Hopefully word spreads quickly and their business thrives in this location. I'll definitely be back for more!\",\n",

School lunches pretty much ruined most things and a Sloppy Joe was no exception. I stopped eating them with absolutely no desire to ever try them again thanks to those cafeteria lunches. Fast forward many, many years later. I\\'ve been eyeballing this location for a few months and finally decided to just try this, though my expectations were low. A little history of this location - it was \"Mario\\'s Shortstop\" for many years, became something else, then it became the \"Thai Shack\", and now it\\'s Sloppie Joes - all different owners of course. Those who know or live in the area should know where this is.While my expectations were low, the menu looked pretty good. I decided on the \\'Big Sloppie\\' and ordered the \\'Average Joe\\' for my son, who wanted to also try something from here. The Big Sloppie was quite good actually and instantly I felt that grade school lunch stigma go away. My son liked the fries and his Average Joe enough to where he asked me if we could order from here again soon, to which I agreed. My second time I ordered the same and added some sides. The fries are pretty good, along with the sweet potato fries. The onion rings are standard but good. I intend to try the salad eventually along with other things on the menu.It can be a little \"sloppy\" no matter how you try to eat it, so make sure you have a napkin handy. The employees have been welcoming and friendly. There are two tables to sit there and eat if the weather is nice enough. Located right across the street from that Empire City Casino. Street parking is limited, since the side streets in the immediate area require permits (thanks to the Casino patrons and their employees) or you can park at a meter. I would suggest ordering ahead of time and picking up if you can help it. If you\\'re local, it\\'s an easy walk over.I\\'ve been here twice and will return again.

There's now a walkable pass through opening between the bar and restaurant lounge area, giving the bar a slightly more airy feel. The reconfiguration of the entire restaurant provides more open spaces that were previously confined. \\xa0Now split into half the size of the original real estate, gives Parq a smaller, yet roomy enough space to hold enough white banquet-style seating, for lounging and snacking on their diverse menu options. \\xa0Unfortunately I am unable to provide a description of Parq's food, as we ate earlier. \\xa0Our impromptu visit to Parq was to check out who took over the last piece of real estate that housed Spoto's for almost 30 years. Parq is in no way the Italian establishment that once was, but a new kid on the block creating their own identity. Only time will tell how well Parq Sports Bar & Grill can hold down this corner of history. \\xa0Note: Three and a half stars for atmosphere, friendliness and a welcomed venue to the neighborhood.\",\n",

My overeasy eggs were cooked perfectly. Runny yolks and cooked whites. The bread was a thin rustic slice and the sausage was a sausage patty. The bacon was really weird though! It was an off brown color, hard, and almost had a jerky taste. Not sure if this was day old bacon or that is just the way they cook it.

For dinner we had the pescado samana (sea bass), langosta mofongo, and the churrasco. Everything was plated beautifully. The lobster in the mofongo was rubbery, had shell in it and was just unappetizing. The shrimp included in the mofongo was tiny. Another person in our party asked for no lobster, only shrimp and she received plump large beautiful shrimp. I'd much rather have that than the unappetizing lobster!

We also got a soup that reminded me of a ham bone stew with meat that melted off the bone. Sort of a sancocho without the giant bites of tubers and vegetables. We got one and split it three ways as an appetizer. It's big enough to make a whole meal. It was very tasty. Cloisters Grill was clean and comfortable.

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'EXCELLENT, Just GREAT Pizza!! Stumbled onto this place a few weeks back on the site of the old Ronnie\\'s. They are AWESOME! Friendly as can be, and the food is great. The pizza is simply delicious. No stupid trophies in the window claiming to be the best, no nonsense, just great delicious pizza. You can tell from the first bite that the ingredients are fresh and the cheese is premium because when it melts it does NOT turn into oil! My kids are picky but they would eat the pizza every day if I brought it for them. I usually order through \"Yelp!\" and have no issues, even the delivery guys are courteous and nice!By the slice or by the pie, you\\'re nuts if you don\\'t try this place! It does tend to get a little crowded right after school, but never rowdy and I would rather come here and give my children fresh pizza than that crap they serve at McDonald\\'s! Did I mention the rainbow ice\\'s?Just GREAT!!!',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'Lol where do I even begin? I placed an order through grub hub and decided to trust yelp reviews based on pizza places delivering to my address. This seemed to be the best one apparently. First off, that in itself is a major lie. Delivery time was fast which is always great. Once I had opened my box, I didn\\'t expect to see what I saw. 4 small slices in the hugest box that has now caused my \"toppings\" to shift off the slices. I had ordered special slices and noted in toppings I wanted in hopes they\\'d understand that\\'s the type of specialty slice I longed for. Judging from the photos posted by the business owner onto yelp, it\\'s what I expected to get in the special slice. Instead, what I received was the complete opposite. They literally took the saddest plain slices they must of had sitting there and threw the toppings I wanted on them. For example, I asked for any slice that contained eggplant or veggies that they might of had available and they actually just threw a long thin by sliced piece of unseasoned eggplant onto the slice. They didn\\'t even cut the eggplant into pieces lol. (See photos). The chicken on my chicken broccoli was a joke in the entire slice itself. The pizza dough was surrounded by crust that was now eating its way into my pizza so it was pretty much just crust. The dough itself was so paper thin (See photos) that it just tasted like cardboard. And the chicken was chewy and just not edible. To be fair, I asked for crispy but did not realize that today the crust would be paper thin causing it to just burn instead. The greatest part of this all is when I called the pizza place to complain about it, what I heard what he last thing any consumer should hear. I imagined it to be better like maybe say \"I\\'m sorry that Your pizza didn\\'t come out right\", \"I\\'m sorry for this, let us remake it for you\" - honestly, a simple sorry would of been great. Instead, I have this poor, poor girl on the end of the other line dealing with me and the owner now. I could hear the owner in the back screaming at the top of his lungs. At first, I thought there was a game on their tv and maybe a customer was getting excited. As I listened closer, it\\'s the actual owner arguing with me in the background about how I have shitty taste and how his pizza is the best I will ever have. Insulting me and cursing at me through this poor girl he has on the phone. Didn\\'t even have the guts to pick up himself and say these things to me. To the owner, you are so rude and disgusting, so disrespectful that I am even surprised at how you even have a customer base. I\\'m actually even shocked that you\\'ve managed to gain 4stars on Yelp and maintain it. Wow. Your pizza is actually one of the worst I\\'ve ever had. I\\'ve had frozen pizza that tasted better than this trash you serve. At this point, I would\\'ve been happier with papa johns or lil cesers as much as it kills me to say that. This is the first and last time I will ever be ordering from this establishment. So much better to actually drive out of my way to get better pizza like Full Moon. This place is an absolute joke and a nightmare!',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"The Bronx Pizzeria, stomped their way in Throggs Neck a Few months ago. And when The Tasty Ladies documented their visit, Jason M. and I, decided to try a slice and some refreshments.The name is synonymous with old-fashioned neighborhood pizzerias: typical yellow menu boards and wooden tables/chairs decor. It's flashback to that 80s-straight-up-Bronx-corner-pizza-spot! Nothing fancy and definitely, not the spot to grab an artisanal pie or slice. In turn, our slices were decent (thick for my taste, nonetheless, good): my Plain Slice, had a suitable amount of cheese and light sauce and Jason's, 'White Slice' looked divine. Service was warm and friendly and one of the gentlemen, hooked me up with a Vanilla egg cream that came together ok, with a good trace of fizz. Nice to see a family business, opening and thriving every step of the way in The Bronx!\",\n",

The business was wiling to reschedule us but it would be for another 2 hours. We decided to reschedule and walk around get a bite in the meantime. During our walk, we lucked up on 'Yo-Burger'. It was a very HOT Saturday afternoon. We walked in and noticed a short line. The place overall, wasn't too packed. There is plenty of seating inside and outside. The menu is pretty straight forward and features American classics (burgers, veggie burgers, hot dogs), drinks, shakes, smoothies, and frozen yogurt. There is also beer and wine for sale. Toppings are free for the most part with the exception of mushrooms, bacon, and eggs. We both ordered cheeseburgers with fries and some drinks. We did not try the shakes or frozen yogurt, but the yogurt seems to be self-serve and they offer both low fat and nonfat. The burger itself was very tasty and exceeded my expectations. Honestly, if you like Five Guys or Johnny Rockets burgers, you will like Yo-Burger. The burger was fresh, juicy, and well-cooked. I really did not expect it to taste as good as it did and we were both pleased. The fries were also tasty and hot. Free refills on fountain drinks. No issues, no complaints. Service was also very courteous and fast. I'd definitely return and recommend to others. Its a nice place to come on a summer evening or casual date. We will be returning!\",\n",

You can tell they take pride in what they serve. The meal was definitely fulfilling and my only wish would be to have been able to eat it in the restaurant because I'm sure that it tastes best fresh. Hubby and my sine were able to eat their food in house and mine was take away. It was still good.\",\n",

Prices are a little high, but way less expensive and more suitable for kids than other restaurants on Riverdale Ave. I have also seen children's birthday parties there on weekend afternoons.\",\n",

First off, let me say that I've had lunch and dinner here a number of times, and have consistently enjoyed the wide choice of burgers, the tasty, crispy fries, and the welcoming, comfortable atmosphere. But the party I recently hosted (for 20 people) increased my appreciation of Bronx Burger House tenfold. First, unlike many restaurants, who have a party room in a back-of-the-restaurant dark location, parties here are in a sunny front room, with tons of windows and views of Van Cortland Park. And Laura, the server who helped us, was extraordinary! She let us customize the room to fit our needs, allowed us to adjust when we served various courses to take into account guests who showed up at various times, and was 100% responsive to our myriad requests. The party was a big success, and all of our guests commented on how good the food was and how comfortable the setting.Carol P.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Updating my last review because they've done so much since my initial visit!Firstly, they now have TACO TUESDAYS! Yes...your choice of flavor taco for a discounted price, every Tuesday. Also, if you're looking for entertainment, they also host trivia night on Tuesdays...with a prize. Yaaas.Secondly, they have karaoke on Fridays and have recently have begun to offer live music. I really do love this spot.Thirdly, they now serve adult milkshakes so, go get you one! Oh, and grab an order of Nutella S'mores Fries! All of the bartenders are nice...Nina, Norma and Laura are the best! The owner, Andre, is so very personable and he likes to visit with the customers to ensure that they're enjoying their visit.Tonight, we witnessed a couple try to get a free meal because they saw a bug on the wall. Mind you that today was one of, if not the warmest day of spring yet, and they had their door open. They're also located across from a tree-lined street along Van Cortlandt Park so it would be understandable that an insect found its way inside of a brightly lit restaurant with its door wide open. Instead of seeking management, they tried to dine and dash and got caught and made to pay their bill. I've never seen anything that made me question the cleanliness of this business. The tables, bar and bathroom have always been clean so it's obvious that this couple was out here, looking for a free meal.One thing I'll say is please don't come for a small business because you didn't happen to account for a dinner out in your weekly budget. It's not right to try to skate on a bill at any place. If you have a legitimate concern, write a review or contact the city's governing bodies to hold them accountable. The very first thing you should do is ask for management. Ya'll got caught and looked muy estupido...don't come back with your foolishness because I WILL live tweet you next time If you see a review from these jokers, don't take it to heart because they're trying to make up for the fact that they spent some of their rent money and they're tight AF.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"The staff is really nice and the prices are on point. The burger choices are intriguing and everything we evert eat here is really great. \\xa0Hubby, my son and I come here often and have a few burgers, fries and shakes. The atmosphere is family-friendly and the food is awesome. We've had the Lamb Burger with its Tzatziki, the Cowboy Burger and Spencer Burger. We've ordered their chili cheese fries on the side and loved them. Being that they're only short five minute drive from our home we've frequented them since first trying so many years ago and we've seen their young staff grow and move on and start new. They have a great team at BBH and they've always been hospitable and welcoming to myself, my family and friends that I've brought in.You can't really go wrong with any choice, especially since they allow you to customize and tweak their signature burgers to your liking. Our go-to brunch burgers are now the Old English for hubby, the Chuck Long for me and the Mexican for my boy and we always get our Chipotle Aioli and Habañero Relish on the side. Brunch is $25/pp with the 2 hour AYCD option. You can not go wrong with any of their fry varieties and adding garlic more than often enhances your sides.The bartenders are very nice and treat patrons well. Happy Hour drink specials are great and some of the food options include their Quesadillas, Buffalo Wings and Calamari, all of which are solid choices.They've recently started hosting karaoke on Friday nights at 9pm, the first one being this past weekend. I went with friends, it was fun and can only get better. Bronx Burger House definitely deserves repeat business. It's truly a neighborhood gem and they're reinventing themselves all the time, supporting local breweries and offering great deals. Get you an adult Milkshake because they're now serving those!

       "  'Positive Review 2': '*CASH ONLY*We went here for my boyfriend\\'s birthday dinner - it looked like a quaint yet modern Mexican restaurant, and it\\'s walking distance from our place! \\xa0We walked in, and I fell in love with the dim lighting, deep blue tiles, and whole fruit and growing chili peppers used as decorations. There were only about 6 other people present, which is a lot considering this place is usually empty or only hosting a few people at a time. So if you\\'re looking for a quiet and intimate date night, this is the place to go! While perusing through the menu, an employee comes up to us to see if we have any questions. I didn\\'t have any questions about the food, but I did ask him if they did anything for birthdays. Judging by his answer of \"Sure we can do something.\", it sounded like they don\\'t usually do anything for birthdays, but because I asked nicely, they would be able to whip something up. He also asked if we wanted any wine to go with our food. We have zero knowledge on wine, so he was nice enough to let us sample some of the red wine Bistro Casa Azul has. I felt awful in the sense I didn\\'t like any of the red wine he offered, as I don\\'t drink much, but he accepted that with a smile. My boyfriend did end up getting his own glass of red wine to celebrate his birthday. After some wine sampling, I ended up ordering the filet mignon with bacon and Oaxaca cheese. As I ordered my steak medium rare, it was tender and so easy to cut! This steak was rich, and its juicy and savory flavors were complimented by the fatty bacon and creamy Oaxaca cheese. The yellow rice was fluffy and a bit aromatic as well. Together, they were the perfect sized portion to eat at the restaurant without any leftovers nor without feeling too full - for most people. Later on, as I am expecting the check, our waiter comes out with a beautiful slice of light vanilla cake. It has some delicious vanilla mousse as well, making it the perfectly sweet and airy dessert to end our meals here. A dinner for 2 and some wine ended up costing us around $70 with tip, and because this place is cash only, make sure to bring a lot of cash with you! Bistro Casa Azul is pricey, but it\\'s worth it! If you\\'re ever in the mood for splurging on yourself and/or for others, this is the place to go!',\n",

My mom and I came in for brunch, were warmly greeted and seated right away and quickly received delicious, hot french press coffee. We ordered the bacon, huevos rancheros and molletes. The sauce on the huevos rancheros was outstanding, with just the right amount of heat. The molletes (French bread with pico de gallo and Oaxaca cheese) were yummy, fresh, and simultaneously light and filling. And the bacon... OH THE BACON! The bacon was unbelievably smokey and a little sweet with lick-the-plate-good maple glaze. The owner was always checking in and making sure we had all we need. Overall a great spot for a laid back delicious brunch.',\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Food (2/2): I haven't tried other similar-serving locations so this might be a bit biased. However, at the very least, around this area, this place serves the best chicharron. Skin portion is completely crispy when you bite down and immediately greeted by the fat-gushing juiciness of the meat. Flavor is also top-notch, though likely doesn't require much. Simple saltiness to it without much else (beyond lime juice) that blends amazingly well with the rice and beans. Rice is dry, which complements the meat well in this case. Beans are slightly on the sweeter side and when taken together with the meat, adds an additional layer to the meat without detracting from the crunchy skin. It's definitely not a dish with complex flavor-profiles but still satisfies your stomach.Service/wait-time/cleanliness (1/2): Service is so-so. I unfortunately was faced with a language barrier since they primarily speak Spanish. Despite that, the staff still managed to get my order so I'm really happy with that. Wait-time however, can be long sometimes even though they're not packed; likely related to their slow pace in general. Cleanliness is definitely not something I would expect from this place. At the very least, they maintained it where the food are located. Price (0.5/1): For its price, you should at least give this place a try, though probably not a place that you'd frequent. However, I personally am willing to return just for the chicharron!\",\n",

I just thought that was funny so I decided to include it in my review. Thank you girl, whoever you are, because the food was good. Once we walked into the place, I noticed that there was only one table of customers, family of 3 to be exact. So this place isn\\'t so busy on a Saturday between the hours of 2 and 3 p.m. My friend inquired about a specific soup and the waitress seemed to be confused. I think they both were confused at that time because he\\'s African and doesn\\'t know much about their food and I think the waitress is used to Latino people eating at this place. After all, it is considered to be a Dominican restaurant. Nevertheless, I don\\'t discriminate against food just because it\\'s not culturally related to me. Good food is good food!!! I think she was thrown off by his accent because when I repeated the same thing that he was saying, he just wanted to know what the Dominican soup was made of, she had no problems telling him the contents of the soup. She went to fix his food as I still needed time to decide what I wanted to eat. After looking at the menu, I decided on rice and beans without any meat. The waitress was actually a bit surprised because she even questioned me to make sure that maybe I wasn\\'t forgetting to say I wanted meat. I also decided to go along with a drink they call Topical Mango. I really do think that whoever was responsible for producing the look of the menu, I think they meant to write tropical mango. Because for the life of me, I don\\'t know what the hell a topical mango is. Even my phone wouldn\\'t allow me to spell it the way it\\'s spelled on the menu. I had to go behind the autocorrect and change it from tropical mango to topical mango. Haha. I will have you know that the topical mango was absolutely delicious. It was just a tad bit grainy which was just fine with me. I hate for smoothies to be so thick that it\\'s tough to suck it through the straw. The flavor was absolutely perfect and it was so cold that by the time I finished the drink, I was freezing. Our waitress was absolutely gorgeous. Her skin looked as if you can swim in it. I don\\'t know if you\\'re now viewing me as crazy or just weird as hell, but if you have never witnessed someone with beautiful, Flawless skin... Come here. Her eyebrows were heaven-sent and she had a head full of beautiful hair that was slicked back. Her hips were out of this world and I mean that in a good way. It was as if it doesn\\'t matter what this girl wears, just the silhouette of her body is pleasing to the eyes. Everything from head to toe about her was on point. I remember there was Spanish music playing the whole time. I think that when a place caters to a certain type of crowd or type of people, they forget to include \"others\". They had two television sets on, but because the music was drowning the sound out, closed captioning was on. Of course the closed captioning was in Spanish. It\\'s a good thing they had something like baseball on because I don\\'t need to know what the hell they\\'re saying to watch baseball.',\n",

With that being said, I've had the opportunity to come here only once so far, months before its great and well-deserved review in NYT.This is a REALLY small place, with maybe seven or eight seats in a tight, nondescript bar setting. It's a one-man show, but the owner/shucker Ray knows what he's doing and is a really pleasant person. His mantra is simple: fresh oysters from nearby sources, excellent cheeses, and delicious, reasonably-priced wines. The aforementioned is literally all that this spot offers; however, it's all executed to perfection.You don't find many small restaurants/businesses like Ray's around here anymore, and that, combined with the overall quality of offerings and his genuine hospitality, make this a memorable and endearing dining experience.\",\n",

Service: Gigi is the woman. Friendly, warm, engaging, attentive...she adds to the place! Go say hi to Gigi. I\\'m sure she will greet you with a smile. Menu: options! The menu headline isn\\'t lying. Food for everyone. Vegan/vegetarian/and options for others as well. I went for the vegan options. And I was overwhelmed with my choices. I couldn\\'t try them all because I was practicing self-restraint but I will be back. But plenty of appetizers (some seem smaller than others so definitely ask about the size if you are planning to share; you might have to order two of something depending on your group size). Entrees for everyone (vegans/vegetarians/pescatarians and carnivores). Also desserts YUM. I didn\\'t get any but I did see the table next to me order the coconut ice cream. It was beautifully presented in a martini glass! How pretty! Next time I will try some (and by some I mean a few of their desserts, yes!)Cocktails: please peruse their cocktail menu. It definitely entertained me. So informative and the best part it makes you feel healthy. Like yes I must have the Green Light because it \"aids my heart and weight loss\". How could I say no to that?! They also have wines and beers (including IPAS which matters to me). Food: I had the pleasure of tasting:The guacamole - it\\'s a side and the portion is small. That said, it was very fresh! Enjoy. The mushroom & lentil pate - it\\'s an appetizer and a small portion but it was all mine and it was a perfect size appetizer just for me. Tasty! Vegan Thai curry rice - entree. Decent portion. I would even say big. Good to share if you\\'re into that kinda thing. And then you can order something else so you can taste more items (wink wink but I\\'ve regressed). As Gigi warned \"it has a kick\". She didn\\'t lie. It does. But most of the sauce is on the side so it\\'s under your control. A satisfying amount of grilled delicious vegetables. I didn\\'t eat much of the rice (personal summer body reasons). But it has peanuts in it. That was fun. Although I think it would have been nicer if the peanuts weren\\'t whole. Perhaps crushed would have been better that\\'s just one of my lil picky preferences. Anyway if you\\'re hungry, want veggies, and like flavor in your mouth and can handle a some spice Go For It. Zucchini lasagna - this is an appetizer but can easily be an entree. Visualize this: warm, juicy, cheesy thin zucchini goodness just melting in your mouth. Good yea? Yup it was! And now I\\'m hungry! \\xa0And this place is on the side of the river for me. Ugh.

After too many drinks last night, a bowl of Pace Picante would have been perfectly fine, to be honest, but this tasted more like canned Hunts pasta sauce. Why the hell was it so sweet! And then there were some poorly chopped herbs (mostly stems, really) that somehow made it all even worse. Then came the dry chewy rice, and the beans which tasted like someone forgot to rinse them off after pouring them out of the can. And then the dry chewy Huarache. Then the bland boring chicken tamale which was only made worse by the watery green salsa. Then the bland fatty pork tamale which was only made worse by the watery red salsa. Both of us found nearly every component of our meals a let down, except for the fresh-from-the-bag tortilla chips, I suppose; but I can get those at home and actually have something delicious to dip them in.... It's sad, really, because both the waitresses were extremely friendly, but the back-of-house staff really phoned it in; it was so disappointing overall, it seems like everything was pre-made then reheated & rehydrated -- microwaved. stirred, and served without any pride or integrity whatsoever.

In the past few years the sign has been replaced, but not too much else has changed. I can remember cutting class to sit in the stairs on Marion Ave. eating one of their Cuban sandwiches, one of the best I've ever eaten to this day. This is a place hidden in plain sight, but well loved among residents and workers in the neighbor for eat-in OR take out.The chicken here is a tad less salty/flavorful than I remember, but that could also be because NYC has been cutting down on transfer, MSG, etc. over the past several years. Still, $5 for a savory half a chicken is no bad deal. I most recently ordered one to go and ate it at the park across the street one evening after work last week.I honestly cannot say I've ever had anything bad here and anybody I've brought here has enjoyed the food. I love their chicken and Cuban sandwiches, but also the rice and beans, plantains--sweet and salty, steaks, and desserts. I've passed many a weekend afternoon/early evening with my late mother's here, who also enjoyed it.My advice to owner/manage my?

It's like a NYC borough time capsule. All the bogedas of yore pretty much had the same look, same items for sale, same pricing and they were all the cornerstones of their respective neighborhoods. It was uncanny, the similarities, and it brought back a nostalgia for me that was comforting. They thought everything, down to the clear plastic display cases with all the 5¢ candies that they have on the wall behind the bar.They hooked us up with a large communal table once everyone arrived. Our server was the bartender as well and she was pretty attentive, despite there being a few other tables dining. All of the pizzas are personal sized which is great for sharing. The Spicy, Margherita, Breakfast and Tres Golpe pizzas were among the crowd faves and we also saw a bodega sandwich made in the front. Everyone loved the food.

After reading the reviews on this place I was a little hesitant to say the least but she had been here before so she vouched for the place. She made a reservation for Monday at 7 pm, note that they get a tad standoffish when you mention that you want to make a reservation for a Groupon deal, but regardless it was made.We show up and we are seated outside because the inside was a little too loud and we had a group of 4. The seating outside wasn't bad. Our waiter came out and was a delight (Shutouts to Franklin) Now this is something very important to note YOU CAN NOT USE YOUR GROUPON AND GET HAPPY HOUR SPECIAL. You either get use your groupon deal and pay for full price drinks, or just go for happy hour, you can not combine. We decided on saving the groupon deal for another time and did the happy hour instead. We ordered the Passion Fruit Mojito pitcher was a little too sweet but definitely good and Red Sangria Pitcher was really good with blueberries and apples in it.They also gave us two round of shots of passion fruit and tequila on the house which was sweet. We ordered our food we started off with apps Chicken Katsu Bites which was delicious and the Gyoza which was also good, after that we order the fusion rolls that didn't take that long to come out. We had the El Ninja Roll, Uptown Roll, Mambo Special Roll and the Quisqueya Roll all were amazing and delicious. Our waiter would come and check up on us frequently also which is important to add because most of the yelp reviews state how bad the service is, we didn't notice. They also have hookah which is OK, they only have one flavor which is star-buzz mint which is basic but what can you do and they use the quick light coals (3 kings coals) and anyone that's a hookah head knows is trash.

This later proved to be a burden as when it got later, people started to show up and hate us as they had to wait for that other table. That was awkward. Since we were outside, they were literally part of our dinner.The food takes a while to come.The regular sushi rolls were fine but not phenominal. It was what you would expect as part of a lunch special sized portion at a midtown sushi spot. Small. No clapping, but no complaints either. Average is safe.The specialty rolls are different and they seem to be trying to do something unique and they should be applauded for that. \\xa0These things are worth a try. Many of them have nothing to do with fish.The Dominican fried rice is tasty but sized like a side. It is literally the rice you would find in a small rice bowl. Paired with two rolls, I was still somewhat unfufilled. The El rey is pretty cool.Drinks were ok. \\xa0I went to wash my hands and the soap bottle was basically water put into the dying bottle. Bathroom was otherwise fine, clean and had towels.There was no problem paying by credit card. Gratuity was added to the check. Not sure why, but I'm ok with that. What gave me pause was the credit card bill being returned without the original receipt and a simple total with a blank gratuity line and no reflection that a gratuity had been previously assessed.

The servers at the restaurant are very friendly and attentive; they made sure to refill our tortilla chips when we were running low and asked if we wanted another refill on our sangria when she saw we were out. The tacos are also packed full of flavor and they have some different ones like octopus, where you typically wouldn't find in many of your common taco places.

Ambience is beautiful, exposed brick, romantic lighting, staff is friendly and makes you feel like family.Onto the food:We were 4 people:We ordered 3 appetizers: Portobello mushroom stuffed with crab which was delicious, Burrata (served with fig jam, toasted bread with crisp prosciutto, and arugula with peppers), and the garlic bread ala casa (a fusion of garlic bread, bruschetta with potato croquette). All amazing. And each appetizer was big enough to share (between 4 of us!)Dinner menu has a lot of variety- and has all the classic options. The specials offered that night were also amazing. Our table ordered: the veal special (which was almost the size of the whole table), penne al forno, lobster ravioli with shrimp and pasta primavera. All were tasty, and everyone was so full but had more than half their plate leftover to take home.We were really too full for dessert, but were tempted to try the chocolate ravioli (stuffed with nutella) and the brownie with cannoli cream. No regrets- it was perfect.Wine selection was beautiful. We topped off with limoncello which was very good quality. We will definitely be coming back again!!! We were told they do take out (Uber eats) and they have room upstairs for a party!',\n",

Peppers and onions were still firm and the beef was so tough it was hard to cut even with a knife so they clearly didn\\'t cook it long enough. Plantains were burnt and hard as rocks. Inedible. Maduros are supposed to be ripe, soft, plantains. Also they forgot to put dressing for the salad even though you have to choose your dressing in the app. The beans were watery and plain. Can\\'t say anything about the rice but that\\'s the one thing that is hard to mess up. No utensils were put in the bag. We will be contacting Uber eats to get a refund. Whoever was working today clearly gave no fu**s about making sure customers are happy.

Strictly a to-go spot except in summer months where you \\xa0can cop-a-squat @ one of the very unofficial plastic tables and chairs right outside the doors. Top on my list because they actually serve real chicken gyros. They slow cook the chicken on a spinning grill known as the Gyro/Shawarma machine just like the lamb. Where I\\'ve witnessed many other spots try to offer frozen \"steak\\'em\" like strips when you ask for chicken. Here it\\'s craved right off the machine and tossed a grill to ensure thorough cooking as you order. I\\'m sure that there are now many other places that are good or even better, but when I rarely have taste for a chicken gyro, GK is what comes to mind.

Could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner--there are times I would kill for a good panang or tom yum. Both dishes are literally medicinal for me....the mingling of sour and savory and spicy and sweet? My heart lurched for joy seeing the River sign next door from this place a few weeks ago.And then I found out it\\'s run by the Mumbai Masala folks--by one creep in particular who\\'s singlehandedly ruined over a year of friendly neighborhood service.You see, I\\'ve been a loyal diner there, next door at the Indian joint, for years (run by the same family who\\'s opening this Thai place). I loved the food and reeeeally appreciated the neighborly feeling they gave me; the way they\\'d go out of their way to chop up extra fresh garlic for me whenever chronic Lyme was kicking my butt and I needed the boost?? The way they oblige my request for no dairy in my spinach? I was always SO grateful!!!! For a while last summer I was a very frequent diner (both eat-in and take-out) because of said chronic illness; I was too ill to cook for myself very often (and good food is key to recovery) so I could often be found hobbling my way over there--feverish, foggy-headed and \"beaten\"--for some lovely sustenance. I even took on the moniker \"Garlic Lady\" and they always delivered. :) It was lovely to have them in the neighborhood! Everything from the veggies to the seafoods to the meat was mostly awesome. Their service was warm and hospitable and lovely. Until one day recently, I bumped into one of the male managers on the block right next to the restaurant. At first he just asked why I hadn\\'t been going there as much. I explained that I am lucky enough to have found an awesome partner now who cooks for me a lot--and that (in part thanks to him!) I\\'m mercifully recovering and can cook for myself more often too! He immediately proceeded to make inappropriate comments--glaring through me the way perps always do. It\\'s not even so much *what he said (which was patently inappropriate) so much as the clear entitlement he felt--and ladies you all know what I\\'m talking about here--to deliberately attempt to gin up my discomfort, and the patently pathetic, sociopathic way he in fact gets off, like a little klepto, on that attempted discomfort and *intimidation* of a woman he\\'s alone with. To look in my eye and rub it in that he feels ***entitled to say things he knows I don\\'t wanna hear, clearly against my wishes and without my consent. (Seriously, just keep your hands AND THOuGhtS to yourself bruh....it shouldn\\'t be that difficult!) Like all sexual harassment, it\\'s a POWER play, pure and simple, and it was far too instant/automatic for this to be the first or worst example of someone he\\'s done this to; it was literally a 20-second convo!! He wasn\\'t even hitting on me simply taking the opportunity to get this sick part of him off bc I happened to be alone. I wouldn\\'t trust this motherfucker for shit now--and was dumb to go back there even once to trust him w my meal. He ended up being there and had the audacity to ask me to go next door w him!!?? That was when I hit the ceiling and quite audibly confronted him over it, face to face. In the presence of other diners (even before my fish jalfrezi came! Lol). And in typical perp fashion he 1) didn\\'t see that coming.... assumed I\\'d demure to his shit like women have been doing for too long; 2) was embarrassed as shit... 3) blew smoke up my ass with some phony apology, but was too chicken and busy playing \"dumb\" to even tell me WHY what he did was wrong. No other members of management came to ask me what was up either--guess they\\'d rather keep their heads in the sand and turn a blind eye to his shit. It\\'s a shame bc as far as I can see (except for their enabling?) everyone else is lovely--get rid of this pathetic little perp, and I\\'ll GLADLY repatronize!! With partner and w friends!! But it seems to be a family-run joint so ... I ain\\'t holding my breath. In the meantime Garlic Lady ain\\'t going away--and she gonna shamelessly make a STINnnnnk about this little rot in its management until I know he ain\\'t there no more.

First you can go up to one of the lanes to get your food or you have the option of grabbing a pre made meal.

The sauce was like a mayo base with hot sauce..not what I was expecting and probably wouldn\\'t get again.Chicken Parm Sandwich-3/5 surprisingly pretty decent.

The gentleman behind the register was very helpful and even packaged up the multiple drinks nicely for our long walk. There seems to be a lot of food choices for the health conscious would like to come back another day and try their food.',\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'This review rating is based mainly on the service. True story loading:I came with my coworkers here after a short day. The waitress gave us the lunch menu and regular menu. The lunch special comes with a small (4-6oz.) drink. When she came to take our orders, I used the lunch special menu and pointed at the LUNCH SPECIAL burrito. I also ordered a Mezcal margarita (from the drink menu). When I finished my first drink, mid meal, I inquired about the drink that came with my lunch special meal. The waitress proceeds to tell us I never ordered a lunch special because she saw me look at the \"big menu\". Um, what? My coworker, who speaks fluent Spanish (the waitress only speaks Spanish) attempts to clear it up. She is adamant that because I looked at the \"big menu\" I will be charged for the big burrito and not the lunch special burrito (that is the same burrito my friend ordered). Make it make sense. My coworker starts to get frustrated and she tells us while walking away \"Some people will do anything for $2\". It\\'s not about $2, its about the principle. Not only was she rude and dare I say discriminatory (because I don\\'t speak Spanish well), but had zero common sense or professionalism. This is also not the first time I\\'ve had a bad experience with her as my waitress. I held off reviewing after my first check in but this second time let me know I wasn\\'t crazy.The food is good. Just make sure you clarify every price and what you are getting when you order. I would say I\\'m not going back but I will. She will never be my waitress again though. That is for sure.',\n",
