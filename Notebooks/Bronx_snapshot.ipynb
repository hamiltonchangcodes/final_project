This was my first time here and I was not disappointed.I'm a very picky eater so for me to go to a Latin Asian Fusion restuarant I was praying the food would be great.I follow you'll on IG and seeing the pictures of the food I was like I have to go there.As soon as I walked in I was greated and seated right away.So to get to my delicious food.To start my meal off i had the Lycheetini, now I've never eaten or drank anything lychee.The mix of the vodka, lychee puree and the coconut puree was just masterful.The creaminess of the purees with the vodka was just .Mae recommended the Eel Roll and Cynthia recommended the Lycheetini.So I went with the Eel Roll and The Shrinp Tempura Roll.The sauce that came on the plates of the rolls was a great balance of sweetness to the rolls, I was ready to lick the plate clean lol.I've never eaten Eel before to for this to be my first time I was not disappointed.I was reaching for another piece and realized it was all gone lolTo close out my meal I got the Cold Sake Bomb.The bomb had a nice sweet creamy but dry fell to it. I actually liked it more then I thought I would.Thank You Shangi Red, Mae and Cynthia for a great experience.P.S. I got the Teriyaki Salmon Bento Box to Go!!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I was really conflicted in writing this review because I wanted to love this place , I was excited to see that a Latin Asian fusion restaurant was coming to the neighborhood. I decided to visit on Sunday with my 2 daughters for dinner . We got a weird vibe even before we got out of the cab because there were a lot of guys in the front , we weren't sure If they were arguing or just hanging out .We make our way around the crowd into the restaurant there was no one there to greet us. We looked around to see if there was a host then all of a sudden, from behind us came this guy which I guess was the manager that was outside with the crowd. He brought us to a table next to the bar where other patrons were smoking hookah. That was a no no for me . They had a DJ it was really loud in there where we couldn't even hold a conversation. We order about 5 appetizers, the waiter comes back to tell us that they ran out of 3 appetizers. - WTH !! I didn't understand how you can run out of so many things . We ordered 2 lychee martinis and the Vivir soñando which took forever to get when we finally receive the drinks I see that they have a really pretty flower in the martinis I guess that's why they charge you $14!!!!!The drinks were not even cold and a really small martini glass not worth the price . Now let's go back to the Appetizers- ordered Thai wings - a lot of breading, Cuban egg rolls, ok but Luke warm Ropa Vieja empanadas,- good. Ribs - we had to return they were undercooked . My daughter ordered a sprite it was flat taste like Alka seltzer !! We returned it opted out for a coke which was also flat no carbonation! The manager comes by and asked what's wrong- I told him the soda issues and the ribs he apologized and said he would check. 10 min later he comes back and says he checked the wells downstairs and they seem to be fine . He's not sure why it taste the way it did . I asked did you taste it for yourself to see ??? He said yes then proceeded to say it must be the gun and that your not going to get a lot of carbonation out of a gun like a can !!! Are you serious ?? I've dined in many places and bars where they use a gun and the sodas are not flat !!! That was not cool at all it's like he didn't believe us . Now we get our food needless to say ok nothing to brag about . \\xa0I ordered the coconut chicken with fried rice , mind you on the menu it says Coconut fried chicken i got grilled chicken with a chipotle sauce which was good but not hot , the best thing was the fried rice it was delicious. My daughters ordered Shrimp pad Thai which she did not eat - she said it didn't taste good at all and she didn't have any noodles just some shrimp and a lot of veggies! At this point we didnt even mention it to the manager when he stopped by to ask how our meals were . I was already exhausted from the whole experience. Our bill was $126 which was not worth it at all. I'm very sad to say I will not be returning until they get it together. I'm giving this place 3 stars for the decor , and our waiter Juan was very sweet and informative and the Dj played good tunes even though we thought it was too loud for a Sunday night. This place is very confusing I thought I was coming to a restaurant but it looked like a lounge/ hookah bar / club .\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Note: This is a review for delivery, not dining in. The delivery estimate of 45-65 min was accurate, as food arrived in 65 minutes. I\\'m not too into \"fusion\" food in general, but delivery options in the Bronx are very slim, so we decided to give this place a try. We ordered: Thai Chili Wings ($12) - I was initially impressed that they had not dressed the wings prior to sending them, thinking \"Oh, that\\'s thoughtful. They just put the sauce on the side so the wings can stay nice and crunchy before I dress them.\" The salty wings were room temperature and so wet that they were soggy. The sweet Thai sauce tasted like store-bought chili sauce mixed with duck sauce and did not taste Thai-flavored at all. 1/5Pad Thai ($15) - for $15, it was an exceedingly small portion that didn\\'t even fill the takeout container halfway (see picture). It was very veggie-heavy, which I\\'d be fine with if this was actually pad-thai, which it wasn\\'t. It had soggy cashews mixed in (huh?), a handful of shrimp, and wide, over-cooked soggy noodles lightly stir-fried in a ton of soy sauce that tasted more like Chinese food than Thai. 1.5/5Spicy Salmon Roll ($8) - Typically spicy salmon rolls are about $5-7, so this was on the pricier side, especially when you take into consideration that the amount of salmon in there was VERY light. Also, this was more of an avocado-salmon roll than a spicy salmon roll, because the salmon was not dressed. Also, it was body-temperature from sitting in a bag with once-hot food, and the fish did not taste or smell fresh. I would not say that it had gone bad, but on a scale of 1-10 with 1 being super-duper fresh and 10 being rotten, I\\'d say this was a 6.5. I don\\'t mess around with not-fresh sushi, so I had to toss this. Also, no soy sauce was included. \\xa00/5Shanghai Burger with Yucca fries ($14). I ordered this burger well-done, because I generally don\\'t trust undercooked ground beef from most restaurants. The burger that came to me was not only not-well-done, but it was bordering on raw. It was so rare, as a matter of fact, that the fat in the ground beef was still white (see picture). Yucca fries were wet and soggy but still hard in the centers. 0/5Overall, I was unhappy with the food I received. Our meal came out to over $60 (!!!!!) with tip plus a $3.50 delivery fee, and there was not a single item that we enjoyed, and the majority of the meal had to be thrown away (we ended up having to order a pizza). Obviously this is just one person\\'s opinion, but at the very least, my two cents is that this restaurant needs to re-think their delivery containers and the timing of their delivery. If their food is sitting in a car for 40 minutes inside unvented plastic containers, there is no way that the sushi isn\\'t getting warm and all their hot meals are turning into mush from the condensation. TBH, not sure how much better the food would be if eaten fresh out of the kitchen, but for sure, I would not personally recommend this restaurant for delivery.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': \"Conveniently located across the street from #6 train so transportation on a tipsy night should not be a problem. Very nice setting, everyone was enjoying the music and and the bar crowd was packed seeing it was a after work social venue. Food: Chapiodora sushi, pork bao buns, chicken lo mein. Not what I expected; noodle dish was salty, pork buns should not include the roasted skin makes it very chewy, \\xa0and the Chapiodora was a unique sushi but tasty. Management and staff routinely checked in with the tables. So I expressed my disappointment with the dish and they were very receptive. Overall we'll be back.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Definitely not impressed with this place. It's a shame because I've been wanting to try it for some time now and I wish I'd never been. Draft beer was flat and not as cold as it should be, calamari didn't taste like anything and the sauce on the side wasn't that good. Thai wings weren't anything special and the Chaufa Rice was not good at all, the egg on the top made no sense. The only good thing I could say is that music was good, we found parking right in front and our waiter was very nice. Oh I forgot to add that $14 for a small drink is insane! Most definitely won't be returning.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I came here with family, a large group at that. This restaurant served us well. It's based, from what I understand, on the premise that they have traversed many lands and countries, and have fused the foods from those countries onto various dishes. The premise of this restaurant as a result, tends to create very delicious food ideas. Who would've thought a burger with sweet plantain (plátano maduros) would taste great? It did take a while for our food to arrive, given the large size of the party, and a few people that were there besides us. The food was served well on nice plates, and the restaurant was overall clean. I had no issues in general. I'd return again.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"My girlfriend called me up and wanted to meet for an early supper at Travesias. Upon entry, we were given a very nice table and I'm assuming it's because she's a regular so they hooked us up. The server came to the table quickly and took our orders. They have some decent specials but we went with a bottle of Tempranillo for the table. We started with the Passion Ceviché, which was very good. The portion was small but it was served in a tiny, cute mini mason jar. I liked the flavor. As we do at most outings together, we ordered a slew of items to share. We had the French Avocados which are basically huge slices of deep-fried avocado and they were crunchy on the outside but creamy inside and flavorful. We also had the Golden Crab which are basically crab wantons. They were ok but the Argentinian Steak Pinchos were tender and wonderful! We also shared an order of the Oxtail Risotto which I would have to say, was an interesting take on risotto. The oxtail meat was tender and full of flavor, as was most everything we had; the risotto was creamy and not too cheesy. I was happy with that selection. The staff very attentive. We had a great meal and I would definitely make a return visit with hubby and my son.\",\n",

We had a good table, the staff was nice and accommodating but the food was horrible compared to my prior visits.They completely messed up our appetizer orders, giving us the wrong proteins with our tostone sliders. They looked pretty but they were not made right.I ordered their oxtail risotto because, that's the dish that had me in love with the place when I first visited. Unfortunately, this time it was far too salty and the risotto was way overdone. Since I was starving, I just ate what I could because, if you know me and my reviews, I never order anything else if I have to send a dish back to the kitchen. I'll sit and starve and then pick up something from somewhere else (don't judge).We've had 50/50 experiences since my vey first visit but I think this will he the last time we give them another shot. From what I've heard, they've changed chefs and that could be the reason for the inconsistency. Either way, Travesias won't be my next stop.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Will be back again. Great food and flavored to point. Good price. True Dominican restaurant, small narrow but quaint. Meals in small cast iron skillets, drinks in light aluminum cups, completely the humble side to a Dominican touch. The menu varies on days of the week which if you don't know the menu and want berenjena asada which is what I ordered, you would need to know which day of the week they offer it. Menu could be bigger. Restaurant is small for the amount of hype it has. Waiting is long. We went at 1pm and were seated by 2pm. Staff is very laid back. On the slow side to clear tables and get the waitlist moving. The place closes at 8pm so for people looking for a late dinner it's impossible. Must get more backed up the waitlist on the weekends. I enjoyed the dish I had. My husband ordered the mofongo and he said it was ok. He also had concon with guandules en coco which he liked a lot. Concon is the hard part of the rice at the bottom of the pot for those who have no clue. Decor is quite nice, gives you a feeling of being away in the Caribbean.

Which made no sense because they sat my party of 2 down with people who were just putting their names on this \"waitlist\". When we were finally seated the waiter completely forgot about us and even took down the order of someone else who had just sat down. \\xa0As we waited no one ask if we wanted water or a beverage. \\xa0After 10-15 minutes she came to take our order. I was ready to just walk out as my first impression is service is very unorganized with the seating and ordering. In terms of the food we got the tostones chimi sliders and it brought 3 \\xa0it was delicious and filling and actually warm. Our entrees however we got the churrasco with white rice and beans and a lasagna on the side. Unfortunately the entrees were not hot.

       "  'Negative Review 2': \"The food here is very delicious. \\xa0Based on the previous sentence, you might be wondering (rightfully so) why I'm giving this place only two stars. The answer: awful customer service and outrageously long wait time.I came here a couple of months ago with my family (I'm writing the review months later because I was in law school when I came here and was too busy to write a review).Do not be fooled by instagram posts or pictures of this place from cleverly selected angles -- this place is RIDICULOUSLY small. There are only like 6 tables inside and there is very little room to even sit or stand inside if you're not at a table dining. This means that if you go on a bitterly cold February afternoon, like we did, you will be stuck waiting OUTSIDE in a little standing area they have. The worst part: this little standing area is covered by a tarp but is NOT heated, so you will be FREEZING as you wait 2 hours to be seated. That's what happened to us. We waited over 2 hours in the cold and by the time we got seated my dad and I both had migraines. Moral of the story: don't come here when you're hungry. You have to come here with snacks because you will be waiting HOURS. Also, don't come here in the winter or you might get frostbite waiting outside in the cold for 2.5 hours.The reservation system here is a mess and quickly delved into mayhem. They make you put your name on this list, but the system crashed twice while we were waiting and some people's names were skipped or never put on the waitlist at all even though they waited hours. One family next to us waited almost 3 hours to be seated.Based on the lack of organization and outrageous wait time alone I cannot give more than 2 stars, even if the food is good. This goes beyond a lack of customer service.. it's disrespectful of people's time to have them waiting on line for 2 hours in the cold without so much as a hot cup of coffee or cocoa and then tell them that their name is not on the list or that the software crashed.Whoever owns this restaurant definitely needs to amplify this space or open a new venue. The owner should also invest in a heater for that tarp-covered outside waiting area they set up in the winter. It is WAY too cold to be waiting outside, but you have customers waiting outside due to the lack of space inside and then you have the audacity not to heat the outside waiting area. That's crazy.The food is really good, but customer service is basic and the lack thereof is appalling.\",\n",

HOWEVER, better that then them going out of business by overspending on product that goes to waste or compromising on quality. My advice, grab a Margherita and some eggplant empanadas because YUMMM.

Fantastic! I am very happy that we have a good Italian restaurant back in the neighborhood after the one that was there closed down. The owner's wife was our server and she did a wonderful job considering it was the first time she waitressed. Ok, the food.... delicious and generous portions. The chicken parm was cooked perfectly with a light sauce. I am ecstatic that there we have our Italian neighborhood restaurant back. I hope they they get set up with grubhub so I can order online. The only recommendation is to have a worker near the door to greet the customers. With all good stuff going on , you might not see a customer come in. If you are in the Pelham Bay area stop in and give it a chance. It's a new place and family run so forgive any little issues, you'll enjoy the food and people and that's what its all about...right?

I was very excited when I saw how stunning the transformation was both outside and inside! They retained the brick mirrored wall but introduced complimenting brick on the other wall with new flooring, modern sconce lighting and tables with black formal covered chairs! The menus were bound with a nice selection of both Italian classic dishes and new unusual dishes!Our server \"Adele\" was very friendly and attentive and brought our drinks and bread service quickly. The bread was a nice crusty Italian bread with butter. I\\'m sure if you wanted seasoned oil for your bread they would accommodate you. We started with the \"Dirty Chips\" which sounded interesting but wasn\\'t sure I would like the combination of their homemade potato chips topped with Gorgonzola meat sauce and chopped meatball and tomatoes. \\xa0Well let me tell you, this dish was addictive! I could not stop eating it! It was like Italian Nachos on steroids!! You have to try them. It was hard to pick an entree since everything sounded amazing! \\xa0We decided on their Chicken Parmignia \\xa0and a side portion of pasta and their signature Orecchiette with sausage and broccoli rabe. \\xa0Both entrees were huge portions, plated beautifully and reasonably priced. They were perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious!! Even though we were stuffed, we had to try one of their homemade desserts! They have several flavors of homemade Ice Cream, and several homemade pies and their decadent homemade cheesecake! Other desserts were also available. We had the Cinnamon Smash which was insane! Fresh made, piping hot cinnamon buns with a huge scoop of their rich creamy Cinnamon Ice Cream!!!

I could go on and on! We met one of the owners and Chef, Robert Orricco who grew up in the neighborhood and has had a lot of experience in the restaurant business and jumped at the chance to open his own restaurant when he heard this location was available! \\xa0They are open everyday except Monday and will be having their formal grand opening shortly.

They had no liquor license, which most people could look past during an opening but without liquor and a waitress that pays no attention to her table, it seemed as if we were more of a nuisance. It was an unfortunate experience as we used to be regulars to the old restaurant that resided in that spot. After leaving and having to go out to eat at another restaurant that night, when we got home and looked at our food that we took from Orricos we noticed we weren't even given all our food that we paid for. I will say the food that we did get was good, just the hold dining experience in itself at the restaurant needs a lot of work. It's a beautiful looking restaurant, but without good service it's useless.\",\n",

Now mind you it was dark meat chicken which is traditionally much more moist than white meat but was STILL super dry! It was obviously laying around and really shouldn't have been sold as is. I didn't want to argue so I just tossed it. It's a shame since I don't live far from there and was hoping the reviews were accurate since it'd give me another snack option in the neighborhood.

This is changing though as the years progress, and I\\'m excited to see new, innovative eateries enter these neighborhoods. For this reason, when I saw Sofra pop up last year with its large sign reading \"traditional Greek and Albanian cuisine\", I instantaneously put it on my radar to try. Sofra\\'s exterior is unassuming; nestled among a small strip of stores on Williamsbridge Rd, you really don\\'t get a feel for the place until you go inside. Once you enter, you\\'re greeted by a small lounge area up front followed by tables and the kitchen in the back. The restaurant isn\\'t large, but it feels spacious and is decorated nicely. The color scheme is mostly browns and woods and has a rustic/Mediterranean aesthetic. There was a mixture of modern American and Italian music playing throughout the restaurant. The menu isn\\'t large, but just enough to offer a good variety of traditional meals as well as ones that are accessible to the general public. We decided to start with the cheese byrek. This was really good - warm, chewy, flaky, with a good proportion of cheese; I was in carb heaven mmmmm. For my main I had the chicken paidakia; this was flatted grilled chicken breasts served with fries and salce kosi. I enjoyed the dish - the chicken had good flavor and the salce kosi complimented it well. This may sound shallow but I was loving the fries, I don\\'t know what they did to them but damn - hot, crispy, and delicious. Service was on point, and overall I had a great experience at Sofra.

When we got to the hospital, we put two candles in the container and sang her a very rapid version of, \"Happy Birthday\", before we caused the fire alarms went off. It was great. She appreciated it and she devoured that burger. She said it was a very good burger.I\\'ve been perusing their menu and I think it may be time to head over there again.

I came across Nana's kitchen under Mediterranean category and realized that it has mainly Albanian cuisine which is apparently very close to Turkish cuisine. They have Quofte like we have kofte, their suxhuk is same as our sucuk, they serve feta cheese along the salad, \\xa0their bread is like our pide, their rice pudding is like our sutlac, list goes on and on. So You get the picture of how similar it is.I was wondering if they could satisfy our high expectations, and ordered kofte plate for my husband with a combination plate( kofte and sucuk) for me. The delivery arrived within the time window.Wow and the kofte tasted amazing. It was well cooked, juicy and has very fulling portions. I didn't like the sucuk a lot- mainly it is me being picky here with the need for particular spices that I want to taste in the sucuk. I ordered baklava and rice pudding as a dessert. Baklava had pecans/chestnuts which I am kind of allergic but my husband liked it. (I like more the pistachio filled baklava- which I can try if they ever put in the menu) I tried the rice pudding: it was very mildly sweet and fresh. I am not a sweet tooth and it satisfied my need for something semi- sweet very well. Overall , The portions were just right. We felt full -not being overfull.Today we ordered again- kofte and quesdia with chicken this time. Again everything was delicious and very timely delivered.So I have all the reasons to love this place- good food, timely delivery and reasonable prices. I definitely recommend Nana's kitchen for those who want to taste good, authentic Albanian/Turkish food in the Bronx.\",\n",

We try new Asian fusion/ Japanese places whenever we can. So when Flame popped up we were thrilled. My husband, sister, and I went for dinner. The show was not really that amusing. A lot of noise making with banging on pots and singing in a loud drawn out fashion \"riiiiiiicollllaaaa\" (yes, we got the reference) but all the singing didn\\'t get a laugh from our table it was just really weird...The food was just ok.As others have said, the soup you usually get at hibachi is some form of miso soup/clear soup. This one was beef broth with very odd tasting meatballs swimming in the broth. Not very appetizing. The food was a bit bland, the dipping sauces they provide help though. The vegetables were cooked perfectly. We asked for no shrimp appetizer with our meal, but it was placed on our plates anyway. They don\\'t offer any rolls of any kind in the appetizer menu which seemed odd in a hibachi restaurant. Though they do have dumplings, which were tasty. The one thing that threw us off completely is that there was NO WASABI at this restaurant. It\\'s a HIBACHI restaurant...there is grilled meat there...but no wasabi? One of the staples of Japanese cuisine is raw dab of wasabi on a good cut of meat. Overall, it wasn\\'t horrible.. And they did just open, so maybe they\\'ll adjust over time.

Could hardly hear each other over the todays tops hits playlist (more like bar music rather than dining playing, not offensive at all, just was unexpected), also very loud fellow diners. Food came out super fast- well the appetizers- after that, it was like we disappeared. 45 minutes we waited for our main course after the appetizer- we almost decided to just tell them to forget it.Ordered the Insalta Di Mare appetizer, definitely enough to share. Super light. Then we got the seafood pizza- outstanding, we couldn't stop raving about the sheer amount of seafood on this, really great. Only negative is they cut it into 4 pieces when it really could be 8- (huge slices), we were going to ask them to cut it again for us, but as stated above... the service was hard to flag down. A mini was more than enough for 2 people, and we brought home a slice (which is more like the size of 2 slices). Then 45 minutes later... we get our main course. I got the patricias salad with chicken- huge salad, beautiful and this would have definitely been enough to split as well, I was so full I brought most of it home (in the future we agreed we wouldnt order as much as we did) My mom got the rigatoni with broccoli rabe and shrimp, also delightful and full of flavor. We were scared to get dessert due to the wait, but opted for the almond cake. Soooo light and pleasant, great texture and mild sweetness. We got there around 5:50 and ended up leaving at 7:40.

For me personally theres no flavor or seasoning in the batter so its just plain seafood...its not bad its just nothing to get excited over imo.The eating area inside is basic and the outside....... a mess.

I've noticed that the price in food had went up, yet the quality was something to be desired. The fish and chips came out too fast to be deemed fresh, and it clearly tasted as though it was microwaved quickly and brought right out. The empanadas confused me as they came with soy sauce and had the consistency of dumplings? Yeah..they were dumplings.

Vegetable Samosa was also tasty- but a bit on the spicy side for me.I also tried their dessert - indian rice pudding. It was very delicious, mildly sweet and refreshing.

It is very trendy compared to other restaurants in the neighborhood. Prices are very fair.One of my gripes with Novelty Eats is that it can be inconsistent, especially when it comes to the milkshakes. You often have to ask them to make the shake thick or else it gets a little watery in terms of consistency. When they do get it right, no other shake can compare. Additionally, wait times can be excessive when the place is packed at night. A friend and I had to wait at least a half hour to get our order of milkshakes and mozzarella sticks.Some of the other food I have ordered at Novelty has been pretty average including the fries, mozzarella sticks, and the wraps. I ordered the Jasper Jones wrap once while with family. The wrap was so hot that I could not start eating it until everyone else had finished eating their meal.

I had 2 gripes with the burger, one of which was that the patty itself didn't have a ton of flavor, the other was that I had a few bites that included cartilage of sorts (think really unexpected bites into a hard piece of something). I also ordered the angel fries that were slightly mushy for me, but were on point flavor wise - which helped me look past the texture. Rounding out my order was the Oreo milkshake, which was solid but somehow they forgot to pack a straw. Separate from them, I \\xa0had an issue with Grubhub that didn't allow me to redeem an active offer they had, \\xa0$7 off of orders for new customers only.

It's not very large so if you're a large party I would suggest reservations just in case. Even though we dined during brunch we decided not to have any drinks. Because the prices seemed a little steep - I wasn't not expecting City prices. For entrees, we ordered the chicken and waffle and shrimp omelette with avocado. The chicken was tender but could have used more seasoning. The shrimp omelette wasn't great because the shrimp wasn't seasoned at all. I think adding even a little bit of salt and pepper would have gone a long way. The good part about the omelette was it did have a decent amount of shrimp wrapped inside.

After spending these past four years living in the area, I make this claim with confidence, and I can say that Roberto's is by far one of my favorite Italian restaurants.While on a special date with the woman I love, I was honestly shocked by how amazing the food was. The lamb she had practically fell off the bone. The ribeye I ordered was not only cooked to perfection, but was also paired with the most delicious sauce I may have ever had. Half was through the main course we asked for more bread to help us practically lick our plates clean. The food simple cannot be beat, and I am sure whatever you order will make you feel the same way.The only small caveat that keeps this restaurant from the 5-star review it likely deserves are the prices. The food was worth every penny, but when it comes to drinks, they quite frankly rip you off. After taking a look at he wine list, nothing is priced below $48. When attempting to order a bottle I know was good, they informed me it was out of stock so the waiter recommended the house cabernet. When it came to the table I was very happy as it was one of me and my girlfriend's favorite budget wines($10/bottle retail). When I received the check they charged a whopping $48 for it. I was expecting a decent markup, but to me, close to 500% seemed far too unreasonable.Nevertheless, I highly recommend Roberto's for some of the best food you will ever eat.

Beyond rustic and meticulously decorated. They're a proud people.We had the mantia, this was hard to cut in half and has the most delicious oniony flavor. The bottom seemed over cooked although it wasn't. The 'shop' salad was simple and the olive oil tasted super good. The stuffed cabbage was delicate, the sausage was skinless and so good, the smoked sausage and beans was way too spicy for the audience, sausage dip and a cucumber dip are not to be missed. There is no alcohol, no wine etc...nor can you bring it in. It's all comfort food and will be great on a cold winters night. Water was brought over regularly. Oh the bread looks like blown up pitas. It arrives hot, a little chewy.Easy to find. You can park in the muni lot on Arthur ave. If you go through the market from Arthur Avenue, out the back make a right.\",\n",

They never greet you when you walk in, they dont pay much attention and never come back to check if we need anything else. How do you expect someone to tip you when all you do is drop food on the table? McDonalds is better even though they dont have table service!!!! And what is the deal with rushing people with the food? They drop the entrees before we finished the apps.What caught my eye today is that the server prioritized taking pictures of some patrons rather than taking our order(we were waiting for like 15min) she could have simply told them to wait a bit.If the owner will allow the service to be this bad he should just turn the restaurant into an all you can wat or self service.',\n",

One time for dinner with about 7 of us and we sat in the main dining room. Had lots of apps, drinks and dinner, all of which was delicious and big portions. Everything was delicious! Then we came for the mother's day brunch which you need a reservation and pay for ahead of time and was very nice. This place is huge. After being here the first time, I thought it was just the main dining room plus bar area you could see, but then we learned there are multiple party rooms. Our brunch was in one of those rooms. We were a party of about 12 and we got our own table which was great. It was bottomless mimosas brought about by the waiters. Since there were so many people, it took them a little while, but our table was right next to the mimosa station which was perfect, so we were able to help yourself. They were very \\xa0sweet!! For food, it was all buffet style and included typical breakfast items as well as Italian classics like chicken and pasta. There was carving stations, omelet stations as well ass fruit and cheese platters. It was all very good. They also then allowed everyone to take to go platters and pack food up to go home. After that there was dessert which was also good. They handed out gifts to all the mothers which we gift cards to come back, which was a very nice touch. Definitely recommend this place for dinner or an event like mothers day!\",\n",

I admit, it's not as authentic as it should be but, it makes my day always to eat my favorite dish and they do it well. My only critique would be is to add fresh clams and more fresh herbs. An authentic dish like that should come out steaming hot with the clams opening in front of you. Overall, my family and I enjoy the restaurant.

Baked clams were ALL breadcrumbs.. barely any clam. :( it's a shame this place is in the Morris Park section - typically known for its Italian food.

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Estrellita Poblana is one of those places that has always been in my peripheral vision. This is mainly due to the fact that there are at least four of them in the Bronx and whenever I\\'m out and about I seem to stumble upon one of them. Besides eating at their location near Arthur Ave years ago, I really had no experience with Estrellita\\'s offerings. My brothers and I were in the mood for Mexican the other night so we decided to head over here for some dinner. Located in the heart of Westchester Square, this Estrellita is decently sized. Walking in there\\'s a small dining area as well as the kitchen and pick-up counter for takeout orders. There\\'s another dining room to the right with more tables which makes it relatively spacious compared to their Arthur Ave spot. The aesthetics are casual - it\\'s not divey but also not as \"polished\" as a typical Mexican restaurant you would think of. It works though - and the Mexican music they have playing in the background adds to the feel. We were started with the obligatory chips and salsa - the chips were the thick kind which I appreciated and the salsa had the right amount of chunk. I went basic and chose tacos - they had a number of varieties and I noticed they had a deal where you can choose three for a fixed price. This seemed like the best bet - so I chose chicken, chorizo, and spicy pork. The tacos were good - nicely sized (3 of them were perfect for a dinner) and they didn\\'t skimp on the proteins. The spicy pork was my favorite, it had just the right amount of heat. The chicken was probably my least favorite - it had the least flavor and was a tad dry. I don\\'t fully blame Estrellita though, it was made with white meat chicken and I\\'ve had these types of tacos from other restaurants with similar experiences. Service was good, everyone was friendly and the food was served at a good pace. Overall, for a local Mexican spot Estrellita dishes out the goods. You won\\'t find a grand presence or mainstream things like strolling Mariachi players and sombreros here, but you will find friendly service and good, honest food. I would have no qualms about returning to this or any other of their locations.',\n",

The atmosphere is lively and cozy with a true Italian vibe and decor. Perfect stop for date night! Please note, there is typically a wait during peak hours (dinner time). Join the waitlist on your YELP app before you arrive! The longest I've waited is 30 minutes and that's the perfect amount of time to sit and have a drink at the bar. I recommend any of their daily specials and fresh pasta. They source their mozzarella from a local shop and it's INCREDIBLE.

Which I tried, it was good though not as a strong squash flavor as we thought. The squid ink linguini with calamari and cuttlefish was a huge portion. And there were so many calamari and cuddle fish, like a pound- it was great! The flavor was so good. Very messy and ink stains so make sure to put napkins on your clothes!They bring bread straight to the table. Though the wait service while didn't rush us seemed very rushed themselves and would barely give us the time of day. The waiter was so impatient when I asked for my food to be boxed up. I was literally in mid sentance with him asking for a double box because I got the squid ink pasta and didnt want it going through and dripping everywhere.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Glorious, glorious seafood. It's like I died and gone to baked, steamed, fried, however you like it seafood heaven.My wife and I dropped in for a Saturday evening dinner date and left very, very happy. Not to say the entire experience was perfect, but we left extremely stuffed and satisfied with our meals. We came by at around 7pm and easily found parking on the street a block away. Although the restaurant has a valet parking lot, I'm usually not fond of letting someone handle my car, so I prefer to self-park and walk a few blocks if I have to. We put our name down on the wait list, which happened to be in a giant tent next to the restaurant. There were dozens of people waiting inside and staying warm on the cool spring evening.We were told that the wait was going to be about 1 hour, which happened to be spot on, so we made good usage of the time by studying the menu and decided on our orders prior to sitting. Good thing we did because I could have devoured 10 lobsters by the time we got inside .. and maybe a few crab legs too. As we made our way through the restaurant, I couldn't help but notice how tight and narrow the restaurant was. There were basically 2 aisles in the front dining room surrounded by booths on both sides. Once you make it past the front dining room, past the bathrooms, is the rear dining room, which isn't all that big either. The atmosphere inside was energetic and loud, with multiple large tables dining, but it also seemed a bit chaotic with waiters flying back and forth non-stop.We were attended to pretty quickly and put in our orders pronto so that we could get down to business. The menu was as diverse as any I've seen at a seafood restaurant. I won't go into major specifics, but they pretty much had every seafood I could think of (calamari, oysters, clams, mussels, shrimp, scallops, crabs, crab legs, lobster) prepared every which way (steamed, broiled, fried), which could be served with pasta, steaks, chicken, ribs, etc. It was everything you would want on a seafood restaurant's menu and more! To start, we were served their customary complimentary garlic bread, which was addictively good, and vinegar seasoned vegetables. It's very easy to fill up on those 2 complimentary starters, so try to keep in mind that the best is yet to come.We kept it simple and decided on the Fried Shanty's Pickens' & Dippins (buffalo wings, fried calamari, baked clams, mozzarella sticks, zucchinni sticks and chicken fingers) to start and we both ordered the dinner special, which included 2 baked clams and 1 broiled shrimp highlighted by a 1.25lb whole lobster. Everything was excellent. The Fried Shanty's Pickens' & Dippins appetizer was huge and it easily could be shared between 4 people, let alone the 2 of us. There was an even amount of everything, which is rare for combo platters anywhere. We had to doggy bag almost half of it to go. Everything was fried perfectly. One minor gripe might be that the wings actually just arrive plain and they provide customers with the buffalo sauce, so technically they aren't buffalo wings.As for dinner specials, we both had our lobsters broiled and it was cooked to perfection. The lobster looked massive and much bigger than anticipated too. It was split right down the middle so that the meat could easily be taken out of the shell. There were your usual legs and claws that needed some extra work, but the tools necessary to take them a part are provided. The lobster was very flavorful, a bit on the messy and greasy side, but there was plenty of meat to it.Everything was really great about our food. The restaurant was definitely on the noisy side though and there was a lot going on. In addition, spacing wasn't the most ideal. However, the food more than made up for the less than ideal layout and the service was prompt. Definitely somewhere we would come back to when visiting City Island.\",\n",

You can have music and a festive atmosphere at reasonable volume levels. Other reviews said the music was too low.

Granted, we had avocado toast (bland and cold avocado spread) to start, and a shared side of Bacon (too greasy and very little hint of the candied flavor), but the food fell below expectations for the price paid. The rum cake french toast is really just a very dense rum cake browned in a pan. Not bad, but no need to get it again. Steak and Eggs were OK and tasty but cooked past the requested Medium doneness. Mimosas were kept topped off every time a staff member walked past us, so no complaints there. I might come back and give them a second chance.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! PLUS THEY CHARGE A 20% GRATUITY EVEN IF YOU'RE A PARTY OF 2 PEOPLE!Now that I have mentioned those key points I can begin with my detailed summary of my experience at the Sangria Cafe...We were seated by a nice greeter. However, after that it took a very long time for a waiter to greet us and take our order. Countless waiters would pass by our table and nobody paid attention to us. Finally, a server tended to us, but he was lousy. He did the bare minimum the entire time my husband and I were at the restaurant. He served us warm water without ice on a 90 degree day. And on top of that he accidentally poured a decent amount of that water on the floor and wet my foot, but he couldn't be bothered to mop it up creating a safety hazard for anyone who would walk by. We ordered the Churrasco with a side of sweet plantains and the Lomo Saltado dishes. The wait for the food was astronomical. In the meantime we ordered a lemonade. It tasted like a really cheap lemonade you get from the corner store or something. It was a horrible tasting lemonade. As we waited, 3 waiters bumped into me and my bag. If they aren't going to have hooks for the patron's purse (at the tables), then they should expect us to hang it off of our chair, and if that's the case they shouldn't bump into the bag! This was obviously very annoying. I eventually had to ask to be moved to one of the tables where one seat was part of a bench, that way I can put my purse on the bench and I could avoid this issue.Our food then finally came after God only knows how long (it felt like forever), my husband's food was cold (he got the Lomo Saltado) and mediocre tasting and looking. My food however, was not cold and tasted pretty good. But, my side of sweet plantains did not come along with my food. I had to ask for them twice after receiving my meal in order to get them to eat them along with the rest of my food. My sweet plantains were kind of cold and overpriced. I paid $5 for literally 5 tiny pieces of plantains. At other restaurants a side order of sweet plantains is $5, but I either get a little more than 5 pieces or they are decently sized and warm!Out of 3 sauces that came along with my steak, only one tasted good and that was the pico de gallo. The green chimichurri sauce had no flavor and the brown mystery sauce just tasted weird and bad.After eating what we could from our meals, all I wanted was a doggy bag (since my food wasn't bad tasting) and the check and even those things took a while for the employees to gather for us. When we finally saw the check, apparently although we were just a party of 2 the establishment charged a 20% gratuity fee, something that to me is unheard of for a party of 2 that consumed less than $100! I guess that this is how they ensure that their mediocre waiters get a tip despite the shoddy service!I would never go to this restaurant again. The wait to have our orders taken and for the fulfillment of our orders felt eternal and the staff did the bare minimum. Besides the fact that my husband couldn't enjoy his meal because it was cold and not very flavorful. I thought that this place could be a cool new and enjoyable restaurant because from the outside it looked attractive, but boy was I wrong.\",\n",

The oxtail was nicely seasoned! I only have 2 cons. One, they definitely need more waiters. Tracking our waiter, Victor who was very nice, seemed like mission impossible.

Now let's go to the ambience. The place is a house-like restaurant. They offer a parking space and it's not hard to get it at lunch time. Inside decor is superb and romantic.

This way they don\\'t feel like they wasted money on the Snapple.- have someone clean the wall adjacent to the tables at least once, daily.

I really wanted to substitute the Rice & Peas for Mac & Cheese which was of equal value however, the staff was not budging on the substitution since they said the sides were viewed as free and I'd have to pay menu price for the Mac & Cheese.

There are also bar stools towards the back of the shop to sit at and enjoy your coffee/tea. They have a library of books and magazines you can read, free WiFi and a very clean bathroom. The staff and owner are super friendly, and you can tell really care about their business and the community. I would absolutely come back here again! Please support this small business in the Bronx!\",\n",

The meat was tasty and tender - not at all chewy. The vegetables had a good crunch and seemed home pickled and not from a can. Only down side, and I could be wrong, but the bahn mi seemed to be served on Italian bread, not French, and had sesame seeds and a different texture. All in all, still a very good bahn mi.The biggest downside to this restaurant is their health grading of \"pending\" which means BAD.

If felt like a great place to not only get a bite to eat but to meet up with friends for a few drinks and good conversation. I had the house burger (HK Burger) and fries and mozzarella sticks. The mozzarella sticks were pretty tasty, above average, I'd say. The burger wasn't as good. It looked pretty but it was a little dry -- the bread, the patty, and the extra brittle bacon served with it. Even a healthy douse of ketchup didn't right the wrong.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"HK caught my eye sometime last year while driving down East Tremont Ave. Its modern, brick facade and large floor-to-ceiling windows in the front is not typical of businesses in this area of the Bronx, so I was instantly intrigued. Even though I heard mixed things from my friends, I wanted to experience it for myself. One of my brothers and I were looking for lunch today so I thought it was a good opportunity to check it out. The aesthetics of HK is very modern and trendy. Walking in there's a large, round bar in the center and a combination of high-tops and regular tables around it. It has that industrial look to it - they're advertising themselves as a draft house so that kind of fits. \\xa0We were there on a Sunday around 2pm, as such they were offering brunch. I'm not sure what it included but I saw something in the ballpark of $34.95 which I wasn't looking to spend and thought I could do better off the traditional menu; we were looking for lunch anyway so it worked out. There was a DJ blasting music (I assume because of brunch) - lots of old stuff from the late 90s/early 2000s; I was instantly brought back to middle school dances. \\xa0Because we opted out of brunch, we were given a bar menu which only had some finger foods, a burger, and a sandwich. I know there's a more expansive menu since I've seen it online but there was enough for us on this menu so we just went with it. The menu had typical pub food - we both eyed the grilled chicken sandwich and decided to go with that. The sandwich was pretty good - in addition to the chicken there was lettuce, avocado, cheese, and an aioli on a club roll. The sandwich was pretty good - they were generous on the bacon which I appreciated, but the chicken breast was way too thin. The sandwich came with fries which were nice and crispy.Our server was super nice and the food came out at a good pace, and overall I enjoyed experience at HK. The restaurant lands at a 3.5 for me, but I'm rounding down because I didn't order off their full menu or try their beer. I was also a little surprised to see the place close to empty for brunch service since it's a pretty competitive meal these days. In any case, I didn't find any outstanding qualities that sets HK apart from its competitors, but I'll need to return before making a final assessment.\",\n",

My family and I tend to keep to the same items. For apps I've had: mussels, baked clams, coconut shrimp and calamari. So delish. Ive also had the stuffed mushrooms and I wouldnt get it again - water and lacked flavor. The bread and marinara oil is great \\xa0- they give it complimentary. We tend to ask for more. The pear salad is yummy. They use to GIVE you complimentary salad with \\xa0your entrees and they have stopped doing this. For both dine in and take out. I hate that. We usually get the spaghetti bolognese and penne al la vodka with shrimp or alone. Thats my GO to. I've tried a few other entrees as well. I tried the calms with linguine and it had sand in the clams and little pieces of shell, complete turn off. My husband has gotten the rib eye steak and it's a hit or miss. Sometimes lacks salt. I've gotta the Michelangelo's Alfredo Cream Sauce pasta and it's really good but doesnt heat up well. I've also gotten the Michaelangelo Seafood Special and it's really good as well. Overall I'll keep coming back. This place is in the neighborhood and the food is good.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Amazing atmosphere the back patio is really the allure. surrounded by tropical plants and small lights really creates an ideal ambiance. food was all great. service good, but nothing to rave about. pear salad is absolutely a must!! the house salad was also pretty good for a house, chicken was a bit meh. balsamic dressing is extremely special and flavorful. mussels with red sauce were incredibly fresh and plump, tons of fresh basil and garlic were great additions. complimentary bread and sauce is also included. the personal pizza is definitely enough for 2- we build our own, mushrooms, eggplant and broccoli rabe. the pizza was divine, however the toppings are a bit skimpy- for example i'm a mushroom fanatic and the mushrooms were diced and practically raw which was a huge disappointment. the eggplant was also diced into small pieces (I prefer large slices for a more eggplant parm vibe) the broccoli rabe was also diced. in total the pizza was $21 which felt a bit high for the product, definitely was tasty but would maybe request it a bit more well done and pass on the shrooms unfortunately. when it comes to dessert this was an upset. it was only 7:20pm on a saturday and they told us they were out of napoleons?!?!! how??? literally what. nothing else appealed to us so we decided to leave it at that. would definitely return!\",\n",

We ordered a few appetizers to share which were yummy ( baked clams, calamari & etc). For our entrees we each ordered different things; some people found their food ok like it was missing seasoning, two people that ordered shrimps items felt that it was not fresh & a Ceaser salad was beyond seasoned which made it salty. The place was quiet empty for a nice Friday evening. The staff was attentive although when we ordered a second round of drinks it seemed like they definitely forgot about it because we waited very long & had to reorder our drinks. In general, this is a nice family friendly spot with ok Italian food.',\n",

This pizza had the best crust ever. \\xa0Today we decided to order dinner entrees \\xa0- one chicken, one veal. The only part of the meal that was edible were the veggies that accompanied the meat. I don't know if the meat was cooked from frozen or boiled then prepared for our order but the texture was rubbery. Not at all what you would expect from a restaurant with 4+ star rating on yelp. \\xa0To make matter worse when we called the hostess said she was too busy to handle this call, placed us on hold and after 5 or 6 minutes the line disconnected.

I used to love it here and the food was great but I came by on Sunday and ordered the healthy heart pasta which was supposed to have all kinds of vegetables in it- on angel hair and asked for them to add shrimp. The server decided to give me instead angel hair Alfredo with broccoli and shrimp. Now, I'm lactose intolerant. So the minute I ate it I asked if it had any dairy- he said no because I ordered the veggie pasta that came with a garlic sauce instead and so I continued eating. Eventually I had to stop because my stomach just wasn't feeling right- so we requested the pasta to go and asked for the check. Surprise surprise, the check said what my stomach knew from the beginning, the server gave me Alfredo pasta and almost killed me. How irresponsible can you be? You don't know peoples allergies so you can't give them whatever you want and if they ask you, you should answer. Imagine if I had a severe allergy? This place would've legit killed me. Never coming back to this irresponsible establishment and highly upset they made me sick for two days! DO NOT COME HERE!\"},\n",

The buffalo shrimp platter is to die for- so delicious and pretty addicting too! We ordered this through Uber Eats when we had some friends over and they were blown away.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Visited for an early takeout dinner on an August Saturday. If you plan to eat there, there are about six bar stools by a counter, but not tables. Two shorter stools accommodate people waiting for their takeout. I'd suggest phoning ahead, that's what the locals seem to do.We decided to share an order of Thai Chili shrimp for an appetizer, and then we ordered two fried chicken dinners for the main course. Each of these dinners came with a choice of \\xa0two sides.My only gripe was with the wait - we were told 30, but it was more like 45 minutes, plan your parking accordingly. And yes the food was worth it. Heard Mingus' Goodbye Pork Pie Hat and some Coltrane while I waited, so that helped pass the time.The shrimp, seven in all, were of good size and the coating and heat level were quite similar to those coming from a good Thai restaurant. Underneath the shrimp, yellow rice - closest to an Indian pullao or maybe something Caribbean, and a lettuce salad. The shrimp did not make it home, devoured in our parking spot. A little tub of cole slaw as a lagniappe.The chicken portion comprised a drumstick and a split thigh. These must have come from a very large chicken - it was a big portion - but it was tender and well seasoned - crisp coating --just great fried chicken. Mustard greens were tender and savory, mac and cheese very rich, very tasty, and yams overly sweet for La Portena, but spot on for me. Vanilla scented. Dinner for 2 - $45 without beverages, with plenty left for another day. Great food, great value great music. The five star rating is spot on.\",\n",

We walked in and the man named Evan behind the counter offered to run down the entire menu with us after asking if this was our first time there. The man was training a new staff and was explaining to the new cashier the responsibilities. She was alright but forgot to give us utensils twice when she bagged our food. He was very patience and polite with her infront of everyone. The food was delicious and the man was open to feedback. He made sure to check up on how we were doing.I see a lot of potential for the business to grow if they can maintain this type of service and quality. From their detailed explanation most of their dishes are made in house and that's when you know they put heart into the food they make. I ordered the grilled chicken S. Indian bbq platter but tried my boyfriend's mixed one. Definitely get the grilled chicken and lamb platter because the lamb added an extra element to the dish. I also got the mac & cheese but I don't see what the hype was about. I do taste the sharpness of the cheddar but I've had better. I really wanted to try the fried chicken but it takes 30 mins because they make it fresh. They also ran out of homemade mustard green. My friends and I only stumbled upon this place because we were only passing through. If I am ever in the area again, I will definitely get the fried chicken and mustard greens. Better yet try one item from every category and taste test the whole menu. What caught me off guard was the homemade fruit punch. It was yellow instead of red and it tasted like pina colada! Those thai chili shrimps are finger licking good. I never expected this type of service and delicious food from this small joint. Boy did it prove my expectations wrong.\",\n",

We went with the fish shaped pot pies (chicken or Grass-fed beef) and fries \\xa0$7.00 and one extra fish pie for 3bucks. They were pretty good ,but I wish they filled them a little more . He said the fries were the same as In and Out Burger. Smoked Mac n cheese (5) from a southern spot (forgot name ) it was thick and delicious. They also sold jerk chicken .Watermelon & Mango fresh drinks served in light bulb glasses. \\xa0They were so good. They have four flavors and each \\xa05 bucks . They do take cards here :) Sam's Fried Icecream ! A 100% winner for me . Crispy crunchy ball of love ! I could eat 1000's of them. They batter the ball of frozen icecream (8 flavors) and dip, roll & fry it infront of you. \\xa07 bucks each .BBQ steak with mango slaw & coconut rice was absolutely amazing .

       "  'Negative Review 1': \"If you haven't been to Fordham, then The Bronx Night Market should be on your list of places to visit. Wait.....I don't mean come to Fordham and stroll amongst the mixed bag crowd...I mean come visit The Bronx Night Market with about 30+ (maybe more?) Bronx restaurant/vendors showcasing their goods. I remember well when this plaza got filled up with kiosks selling inexpensive what-have-you back in the day. But Night Market was so badly needed!!! When I heard about The Bronx Night Market back in 2018 from my friend Jason M., I wanted to jump on the bandwagon too and see The BX's well-known and only bustling Food market. It's filled with stalls selling all sorts of eats, Body Oils, Custom Jewelry and a few other things from almost all over the borough- (there was one NJ vendor though). Maybe it was towards the tail end of their season, but I had my sights on Mott Haven's Empanology- but they didn't participate the Saturday night we visited- I'll catch up to them in their restaurant. You'll find lots of vendors serving it up with a little bit of everything. Night Market has the Jerk spot, the Korean spot with Twisted Potato, Tacos and more- even a Vegan Bakery!!! Plus a table selling 'Bronx Night Market' merchandise which I picked up a $20 logo T-shirt. I'm digging what the Bronx Night Market founders created! So if your destination is to only come to Fordham- for The Botanical Garden and The Bronx Zoo, try also coming to Bronx Night Market between May-October on any given Saturday to have a chill time. The BX never ceases to amaze me. Kudos to you guys!\",\n",

The wings were equally good, the sweet chili having a serious kick. Our waitress comes back to take the rest of our orders. We had Salmon *overcooked*, Tequila Lime Shrimp *flavors were off*, Calamari *salty*, Lobster & Crab Mac & cheese *imitation crab, no flavor*, Mofongo *just ok*. In the midst of eating another person came over to check on us so I asked him what the Bombay Ginito & Martell Sidecar are and he didn\\'t know either.

Everything we ordered was edible only because it was made out of food. The sliders (I didn't try myself) were served on stale bread. The calamari was lifeless and full of breading. The bacalaoitos were NOT what you expect, they are small fritter balls, not flat thin and crispy. The mac and cheese balls were dry and served with marinara - these should be served with a cheese sauce if they are going to be so dry. I did mention to the manager on staff that the food was disappointing and she invited us to come back for drinks and hookah on the house. I never went back but thought that was good customer service.

The clam chowder isn\\'t the best but still tasty. The fried calamari is definitely different than other places. It has a breading that is similar to the breading of mozzarella sticks. I got fried shrimp and a whole red snapper which came with fries. The fries were realllyyyy good. It was crispy, seasoned well and pretty thick. The red snapper was fishier than I had liked and wasn\\'t seasoned that well. The fried shrimp was also decent so I didn\\'t really find that entree worth it.I always go for the \"feasts for 2\" and the portions are HUGE! They definitely serve more than 2 people.

I've gotten it with broiled shrimp.All the entrees come with salad. Corn bread. Roll. Butter and cheese. A cold veggie platter (they should stop serving it because that's not really good). They also give you rice and corn which I never really eat, i always forget to ask them not to give me this, I feel like they should ask the customers if they want it. Saturdays they have free face painting for the kids. I think that's a sweet touch. It gets JAMMED pack here. I've learned to make a reservation and I try to stay clear of this place during busy times (Saturdays from 5pm to 10pm. Sundays from 3pm to 7pm). During the winters it isnt as crowded as the summer time. Mothers day is CRAZY here. I learned my lesson and only come on Mothers Day between 11am and 12pm plus I make a reservation. Take out here is great. You get all of the same items you would as the sit down dinner. It's fast and the gentlemen behind the counter knows how to keep the flow going. I hate their website. You cant order ANYTHING through the website. I wish they would update their system. Either way I love Sammy's. I come here alot and truly dont plan on stopping.\",\n",

You should really think about that for a minute\"Boy was she right. New England has spoiled me when it comes to seafood (SNS lol). Tits was my first and last visit to City Island. I can\\'t understand the hype and wish I would\\'ve checked Yelp before going. Oy! Before I discuss food and decor I want to give credit where it\\'s due. Sammy\\'s was PHENOMENAL when it came to accommodating families with children. It was almost as if there was a baby section. The servers were even kind enough to turn off the a/c for one family bcz their baby was chilly. Service above and beyond. The love ends there, unfortunately. The food was bad. The dinnerware was dirty. The service was touch and go (servers were either rushing you to order or nowhere to be found when you needed them). What is the hype about? I ordered crab cakes for an app and the seafood broil. The cakes weren\\'t bad but also nothing to write home about. The broil came out as a plate full of fried food and had to send it back. When it came out prepared correctly (broiled) items were missing and it tasted fishy. The bread plate was a better meal. I left starving, sadly. Lastly the restaurant itself could use a little TLC. It\\'s a bit dated and dank. Lesson learned.',\n",

The menu is quite expansive, I settled on the Sammy's Broil Combination, a combo of broiled shrimp, clams, mussels, fish and scallops for $44.95. I expected a platter similar to Psari Restaurant in Astoria (If you are familiar with Greek Captain, now known as Psari you know what I'm talking about!!). The presentation was HORRIBLE, the portion was skimpy for $44.95. (Psari's broiled combo included more food along with crab legs for less.) I received TWO scallops, TWO shrimps, TWO mussels, TWO clams and half filet of sole fish. The food was extremely BLAND! It was complete TRASH‼‼I will NEVER step foot in Sammy's again! The majority of the party was disappointed. 2 out of 11 were satisfied with their meal.\"},\n",

It's in a great location, with a decent amount of foot traffic, close to Castle Hill Avenue. I was greeted by one of the waitresses there, as other customers were eating their meals. The setting and decor was simple; old-school but clean. It has a good number of sitting booths, as well as the usual variety of tables and chairs. I ordered a cup of coffee; which I found it that it tasted odd. I also ordered the Hungry Woman breakfast special. It consisted of French toast, ham, sausage, bacon and eggs any style. I requested turkey ham, sausage and bacon. The eggs were fried, sunny side up. Each egg had a slice of cooked ham underneath. I noticed that the yolks were a little undercooked. Sadly, that was the first turnoff moment I had. I said to myself, no problem. I simply scraped the raw egg yolks off to the edge of the plate. However, the meat products were extremely salty to my taste. The ham was the saltiest of all. I tried eating a piece of French toast with maple syrup, along with a piece of the meat products. The combination was too much. I simply took two bites of each item. I ended up eating the cooked portions of the eggs, and most of the French toast. That was the best thing I had out of the breakfast combo. I regret not having some cinnamon to sprinkle on top. I would definitely come back to this restaurant, maybe for some pancakes with a fresh fruit topping. Overall, the decor and service were amazing.\",\n",

I must say I was excited to try this place after finding paid parking right in front and seeing so many positive reviews, also the restaurant was full of customers at around 5p on a Wednesday. The restaurant tables were very pretty much full, and there was a short line to order take out. Service was quick, but I think I was supposed to get rice with a small beef stew, but the man behind the counter did not speak English, and I assumed he would include it if it came with the order, which he didn't. In the past when I've ordered beef stew or any kind of stew I was asked what type of rice I wanted to have with it.I got home in about 20 mins looking forward to enjoying my Spanish dinner. Unfortunately that was not the case. The tender beef in the beef stew is a generous portion of tasteless boiled meat floating in a thin watery gravy with bits of over cooked potatoes and carrots. Sadly, beef stew is one of my favorite Spanish dishes and I was very disappointed with this one. Next, the roasted chicken. At first glance, It looked a tad over done, but that wasn't the worst part. It was also bland and not well seasoned. One thing I really enjoy about Spanish rotisserie chicken is the Spanish seasoning! This one did not measure up. Overall, I was not at all impressed with these two choices, I've had much better food at El Bohio on East Tremont. Needless to say, I won't be revisiting this location.Happy Yelping!\",\n",

First off I called ahead to find out of they were able to make chicken drunken noodles without oyster sauce (allergy) and they were more than willing to accommodate this request. I also asked if they had salmon red curry and they confirmed this as well. However when we arrived we found out that they don't use salmon to make the red curry. Therefore we had to go with the chicken instead. ( that's the only reason why I dropped a star, I do like accuracy.

I had blindly followed our party leader to the nearby Mamajuana Cafe a few blocks away. After a long, physically, demanding night of mixing it up with the locals, we decided to make our way home, having accomplished the mission in celebratory fashion. Everyone else requested Uber Evac and something like three of them dusted off with most of the party. I made certain that the last damsel boarded the final transport out and then I proceeded to make my way on foot. I had hoped to catch the 04:16 No. 6 Locomotive out of the area. I could see the trestles when I saw unfortunately I saw the locomotive pull into the station. I knew I was going to miss it and that meant I had to hunker down for at least an hour. Fortunately, I saw the light on at a small establishment on the side of the road, Tremont Diner. I ordered an omelet with jalapenos and silver dollar pancakes with strawberries. The food was quite savory and sweet respectively. The patron and staff treated me well and moved with efficiency. The respite rejuvenated me and I felt ready to continue my journey home. Belly filled, I once again ventured out into the night to catch the next locomotive hoping not to run into any hostiles. Luck was on my side and I made it back to Brooklyn by sunrise. I write to you to let you know that I am safe and will soon be in your arms.

She had the Mexican omelet with tomatoes, onions and jalapeños. It was tasty and spicy but I would have liked some monterrey jack cheese in it. I had the spinach and feta omelet and added some mushrooms. It was nice and the feta was not too overpowering. Each of our omelets came with hash browns and toast, which we both subbed for English muffins. We also shared an order of pancakes with turkey sausage. That dish was not the best that I've had at a diner, as simple as it is. The pancakes are good but whatever syrup they use tastes wrong, like it was sugar-free or something. It completely ruined my pancake so I left it alone. The turkey sausages were a little too watery and the hash browns with my omelet were seasoned well but dry AF ans could have used some chopped onion and peppers like I've had at other places.On the upside, the service is really good. As soon as we sat our server came to offer drinks and take our order. They came often to refill my tea and my girlfriend's coffee and to see if we needed anything.I ordered some sandos for the boys, a Philly cheesesteak with curly fries for my son and a turkey triple decker with classic fries for hubby. Hubby liked his sandwich but my son gave a 3/5 for his. Both meals came with a choice of soup which was nice but the price tag for just the sandwiches was over 30 bucks; kind of insane for a diner.I came here a long time ago with my husband and never reviewed but we don't come often because it's very out of the way from where we live.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Pasta Pasta has been in the neighborhood for years - I remember as a kid walking down Williamsbridge Rd and seeing its sign colored like the Italian flag popping out from its neighboring businesses. Despite this, I have seldom dined here besides the occasional holiday meal. That's what bought me to my latest dining experience, when my family decided to grab dinner here for Easter. Pasta Pasta is situated in a small strip mall on Williamsbridge Rd, but since it's in the corner unit it has a decent entryway and a good amount of space on the inside. It's not the largest restaurant but they have an open dining area with a small private room to the side. The decor is a bit dated and tired, but there are huge windows that line the front of the restaurant that makes the entire space bright.The menu is typical of other neighborhood Italian restaurants, though they have a pretty big selection which was nice to see. For the Easter holiday they had a number of specials in addition to giving us the option to order from the menu. We started with some hot and cold antipasto, fried calamari, and fried zucchini. Everything was pretty good - it wasn't the best antipasto I've had, but I did enjoy the fried calamari; I applaud them for having rings *and* legs. For my main I had the lasagna. The dish looked substantial and amazing, but unfortunately the flavor fell short for me. The meat and sauce were a little bland, and the pasta was over-cooked. Service was good, holidays are rough but they were super attentive. Overall, I feel that Pasta Pasta kind of suffers from being a warm body - it's been around for many years and it doesn't seem like much has changed. The food wasn't awful, just know there are better Italian restaurants in the area.\",\n",

The Chicken and Waffles were absolutely delicious and unique! I would've never imagined that curry sauce and jalapeños would taste good with chicken and waffles, but it definitely did! The chicken was fried perfectly, both pieces were juicy and had plenty of meat. Although the description of the dish initially was a little intimidating, the flavors all complimented each other well and was enjoyable. As for my drink, despite it not having alcohol I thought that it was good. I also was able to taste the Frosé Lemonade and I really enjoyed that as well. It was a nice and light drink.

I don't get that. Why not call me while making my order when you realize the items are not available and offer to make me something else. OR if the kitchen was closing call and let me know while the food is being made or even right before to ask if I even want to continue with my delivery? I get that some profit is better than none, but that is ultimately up to the customer who is not at fault, no? So if I had not called and received my food, someone would just be surprised to not have a meal upon delivery (which would be 9 month pregnant me). When the seamless driver showed up, he said that he was at the restaurant waiting 40 minutes for our order because they had given him the wrong thing to begin with. What's worse, is that the food was horrible. We ordered fried chicken and peach waffles. The fries chicken looked old, dark, tough to chew and tasted awful.

I decided to choose something local, not to far from where we live, we even found street parking with no issues in such a crazy busy area. We are New Yorkers so we knew what to expect and what to do if we didn't find any street parking and thats to pay for a garage. It wouldn't have been for long anyway. Now to Terravita.It's not really a huge place, but just the right size for some intimate dining. The decor of the place is beautiful, and still very stylish for it to also be a casual spot as well. We were greeted by warm smiles and was told we could sit anywhere we like, (of course my hubby wanted to stay in front so he could see his car from up close.) We were offer water and right away my husband ordered some coffee. We decided to go with an appetizer while we waited for our food. That turned out to be an excellent idea, because the crab cakes we order were BOOM! The Bomb! They were so meaty and crisp on the outside served with a lil light refreshing salad of cucumber and fennel. They didn't have a fishy taste to them, or tasted as if they were frozen or came from a can. They were really a mouth full of flaky goodness. Then we got the French Toast served with fresh fruits and a side of creme fraiche, and my husband found that to be so good he wanted to ask the chef for the recipe so I could cook it on a daily basis lol. That bread was moist and super tasty, I couldn't even finish mines because of the large amount it was. My husband took that right off my hands to eat it himself. The bacon we ordered with it was also delicious.

My husband just couldn't stop talking about the Toast. Terravita definitely has found a new happy customer, and I can't wait to return for their Happy Hour and Brunch options.

Peeps we moved back to da mother land and instead of it taking 4 hours by plane, it was a 30 minute train ride uptown on the 1 train. Folks we officially in Inwood. Transition was brutal AF but we love the neighborhood whole heartily. If ya know me the first thing I did when I moved in was scope out good eats. So far, so good...We visited Terra Vita , Dominican - American restaurant on the edge of the heights, by the GWB. You won't get a tres golpes fix but the restaurant specializes in a fusion of Dominican and American cuisine all with trendy, modern flare. I ordered the Terra Vita burger, medium rare which came between two large tostones, cheese, caramelized onions and lettuce with a side of yucca fries. So good. A lot of people ask me where can they find good Dominican food and I would always respond my mom's place up until today. Even though it's less traditional than your average Dominican joint, it's still authentic, genuine and worth visiting.\",\n",

It has a nice clean feel to it and although it is a small place there is usually open tables. It wasn't overally busy for lunch which is troubling considering it is new and there is a lot of foot traffic outside. For lunch I ordered the beet trio salad. It is light and delicious but also a small portion so I left a little hungry honestly. If you dont order it with protein it may not be enough for lunch. My partner ordered the quinoa salad with salmon and enjoyed it too. It is a little on the pricier side than other restaurants in the neighborhood but that doesn't take away from the fact you get good quality food here. \\xa0Service is pretty good too and they have wifi which is always a positive. They also have a dinner menu that has entrees in the $30 range which seems high. Anyway, come check it out and make your own judgement! \\xa0Good luck Terravita!\",\n",

I agreed and no kidding it was ready in 5 minutes. I was a bit taken back and stated wow that was fast. She said they make it fresh and the noodles in 5 minutes.

I went back to the restaurant and stated that I didnt order this and she lied in my face and said I did. From that moment I just wanted my money back. So I asked for a refund. Now a mexican worker is standing watching a black man who was talking to her at the first time I was there. She said gladly with a terrible attitude like I did something wrong. You work in a minority area with minority people and this is how you treat customers who are willing to give this place business and help you keep a job. She went and did the refund came back and said you will get your money tomorrow. I said thats how your going to talk to me, you won't even apologize or say anything. So, yes I said you know why your acting like that because your a nasty white bitch. She literally stuck both of her middle fingers up at me. I will contact the manager tomorrow and if she still works there I will protest. I had to come all the way from my home and that is how I was treated. Not one worker apologized or asked me what happened. This is how minority people treat people. Than the black man who was so eager to who he is an assembly man and will call the police. This is so hilarious coming from this black man. First of all you are nobody but a customer that should mind your own business. I never acted eractic or threatened anyone. I have the right to have been upset and voice my opinion. He had no right getting involved especially being a black person as myself. Just because I am very lite skinned and do not look black and look extremely young for my age doesn't mean I should be treated in that way. It is an establishment in a predominately black and hispanic neighborhood and this is how they treat other minorities.

The drinks were really goid too, the sangrias were strong!The only reason why I am giving them 4 stars is because of the drinks; if you decide to have mimosa as your 1st drink, that is all you can have, you can not switch to another drink. \\xa0Also, although the service was good, It would have been nice to know what was actually part of the bruch drinks; it was not until we were about to leave that I looked at the menu from another table and saw they had beer as part of the brunch drinks, which is what my dad wanted (we had no nenu of what brunch consisted of and a drinks menu at our table). Overall, it is a great bruch spot with a nice view.',\n",

But today I was so disappointed,,, the flavor is good but the fat and purple skin is not removed. It's boiled and just cut up. In the past the pulpo is nice and clean. All you get is white meat and lots of good flavor. We spoke to manager who did discount our bill and mentioned that's the new way they are doing it. Hopefully they will go back to the way it was made.I do love this place\",\n",

My friend(s) and I were greeted quickly and with a smile upon entering. The owner, Justine, personally greeted us each time. She is so friendly and genuinely cares about her customers. \\xa0We were lucky to have Greg as our server for every visit. He remembered our favorite wine and is able to manage several tables and check in regularly. \\xa0During my most recent dinner, Kwame, the general manager, \\xa0stopped by my table with words of welcome. So far, between my friends and I, we have ordered surf and turf, filet mignon and grilled scallops, seafood paella, lobster ravioli, lobster with a mushroom cream sauce, and grilled chicken and shrimps as entrees. Each and every entree has been delicious and plated with an aesthetic appeal. My favorite appetizer so far has been the crab stuffed yucca balls. The stuffed green plantain and empanadas are yummy as well. The dessert menu includes the customary flan and tres leches. However, on Valentine's Day chocolate cheesecake and strawberries and cream were added. I am hoping they continue to test out possible desserts to add as permanent fixtures to the menu. I have spent three special occasions here and look forward to many more.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'If I could give this restaurant zero stars I would. I came in last night celebrating my sisters birthday with family and they intentionally served me spoiled crab legs. The stench from the \"crab legs\" was so acidic, as though they soaked it in a solution to clean the spoiled order of it. I was the last out my party to be served and I waited quite a while for them to damn near poison me with their spoiled food. They have no regard for people\\'s health, well being that they would serve food that is obviously spoiled to any person. I was so disgusted , upset and furious. I told the waiter to smell the legs, the texture was even slimy inside. Disguised with seasoning. When the manager came over she said she new and asked if I wanted something else. I wanted to punch her in the face because it was no way this wasn\\'t intentional. But to not make a scene I had them make what everyone else in my party was eating. When she finally brought that dish to me everyone was done eating so I said I\\'d take it to go. I was beyond upset and hungry on so many levels. Then the epic moment of stupidity came when the waiter returns with the bill where they had the audacity to charge me for the plate that I waited forever for because my first dish was spoiled. He said we only charged you 10 $s. I said you should t charge me anything!!!! You served me rotten food, then I waited for ever for new meal, and entirely missed eating along with my family. Just for everyone to leave without me eating anything. This place is trash!!!! EAT HERE AT YOUR OWN RISK AS THEY DONT CARE ABOUT YOUR WELL BEING AND WILL SERVE YOU GARBAGE AS THEU SERVED ME. When it was Don Coqui it was really good food. This new place is trash.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': \"Went for the first time for my sister's graduation last night. I'm not impressed! Not only did we wait two hours for appetizers BUT we watched the table next to us receive appetizers and meals before we did. Of course they were seated after we were. The manager gave us some lame excuse about overcooking a steak that was ordered and having to make another. First of all, skirt steak does not take two hours to make and secondly why weren't we made aware of that prior to complaining? The server never made rounds at our table to ensure all was well. At one point, someone from our table actually got up to get him. When we finally got some of our food it was left unattended for 10 minutes prior to serving it to us. I truly believe that large groups receive lack luster service because gratuity is guaranteed. Did I mention that the majority of the food was pretty bland? We salted and peppered our dishes to death. The manager did discount a portion of the bill. However, I won't be back.\"},\n",

The view was fantastic, but unfortunately the service was far from it. It took us quite a while to even get menus and then even as our food was served it would take a few minutes after for our waitress to bring utensils out after. I figured the wait times would be kind of long given the disclaimer on the menu that it was possible since everything is made from scratch, but even given that the wait times felt excessive. As for the food we started with the clams oreganata, which tasted very good. It had the perfect amount of bread crumbs and the lemon went well with the clams. As for my entree the salmon was okay, not particularly flavorful and the size was reasonable. The lemony garlic sauce salvaged the meal and tasted great.

The bread provided to the table before the meal was dry and burnt. The water was served in solo cups. The crab cakes were so disgusting they had to be sent back. The clams tasted eerily like the smell of burning tires. Thyme chicken Parmesan tasted like unsalted paper. The cheesecake tasted like the other half of the unsalted paper dusted with Sweet and Low. Nothing was good. Not. The waitstaff was...interesting. Most were decent but one was loud, crass, uninformed and dirty. Yes, her shirt was dirty. She cursed repeatedly and when asked couldn't explain items in the menu. I was relieved when she sat down to talk loudly on her cellphone and drink a soda. At least we could have a moment of peace. To make things worse, the food wasn't even cheap. I've had better meals at Burger King for a quarter of the price.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': \"Really awful experience with a church function. Paid over three hundred for a party of 12 (we brought our own dessert). One guest was never served dinner despite waitress checking once and guests checking four times. Once we were told that the 'owner', which was actually the owner's daughter, couldn't be disturbed (she was at the front door looking on a phone at photos with a customer). \\xa0After the 4th follow up, we were assured the meal was coming. (Linguini w calamari). Most of the party was finished with the meal, so in lieu of the error and because it was now really late, we asked for espresso w sambuca for the table. \\xa0Was told this request was ridiculous as the missing meal was 'only $14.00'. We were told 'we don't have after dinner drinks' we can give you soda.' ( We opted for free American \\xa0coffee instead, despite the fact it was included in the lobster meals ordered by 1/2 the attendees. We were also told they couldn't make espresso or cappuccino b/c the machine was broken, so we couldn't order that even if we wanted to pay for it ). So actually we received 5 free American coffees; one person passed on coffee. \\xa0Waitress told us she would be responsible for the cost of the missing meal btw. If this is how the owner treats staff, as a customer you can't expect better treatment. As a sign of good faith, we left a 10% tip. But on the way out we were told, the waitress really didn't have to pay for 'her' error. So not really sure what to think.  It's a shame b/c the food is pretty good here; the cooks/kitchen staff bus boys work hard, I'm sure, but the 'owner/s' obviously couldn't care less for their staff or their customers. Don't cast pearls before swine; go to Red Lobster instead.Update: received a call from Kelly manager of icehouse on 5/25 asking me to call back; would not stay on phone. Returned call and was told by Kelly that my 'husband' and I made waitress cry (they have it on camera) and other customers had to console her. She also told me 'waitress brought food to you at the table but you turned it down.' I told her that the food never came out of the kitchen. She insisted this was the case. I told her she was wrong on all points. The owner, Terry, jumped on the call then and said that my party of 12 all apologized for my behavior and that they have that on camera. I said that was wrong. At the end of the night we gave a 10% tip despite the bad service and b/c the waitress told me she had to pay for my meal. ( The waitress also, as promised did not add the coffee to the bill, or a tip.) Kelly then insisted that their staff NEVER pays for mistakes. I asked her why the waitress felt compelled to tell me something like this. Their employee policies have nothing \\xa0to do with a customers. Terry then jumped in again and said, This is not the restaurant for you. I explained that we've all gone to the icehouse for many years, and I even had a big party there, which was great. We're repeat customers, never had a problem. Then Terry said I was cheap and I cheated her out of a tip. Then she hung up on me. Really sad treatment of both customers and staff.

I didn't have the opportunity to sit down and enjoy my meal since I had a flight to catch, so I had to carry my meal in a plastic bag. I regret not holding my meal upright because I believe this caused the garlic sauce to leak from the container. Once I finally got to the airport, I had the opportunity to try the food. It was decent, definitely not mind blowing. \\xa0I'd say it was somewhat bland in nature, and some of the pork had of inedible fat.

Ultimately the owner never came, which was a huge disappointment when the staff said he would stop by. The food itself was extremely overpriced, lacked flavor, and was subpar quality. The \"seafood combo for two\" is more of a seafood combo for five people (very misleading). The rice was absolutely terrible.

That's all cute and dandy, but the shellfish was now cold while His Slowness crawled to the kitchen to pick up the rest of the meal, and then bring it to our table. \\xa0The shellfish initially came out warm, and now it was just cold...not good!For $80, the king crab legs were a bit too few. \\xa0They were large and meaty, and cooked well, but there just wasn't that many of them. \\xa0The lobster was also cooked well, but could've used more seasoning throughout the whole thing instead of just in the middle. \\xa0The baked potatoes were not good AT ALL. \\xa0They were cooked in too hot an over for too short a time causing the skin to burn and the inside to stay hard in the middle. \\xa0That was really disappointing. \\xa0Not only do I really enjoy a good baked potato with butter, but they are so incredibly easy to make and we like to eat the skin. \\xa0The linguine in white sauce was really good although the missing grated cheese would've made it that much better, but it was a very nice surprise indeed. \\xa0I would venture to say it was the best part of this overpriced and very disheartening meal. \\xa0For all that money, I really wanted to love it and that just didn't happen :(\",\n",

It's an old restaurant I figured, I probably should have left at this point but I was just hungry and tired. It's 7PM and I have to be at work early the next day.We order our really overpriced food which takes a good half hour. That's not too abnormal, but there were barely any customers here, so I'm not sure what the hold up was. Seafood cooks pretty quick. I had some fried fish, which was pretty crappy overall considering I've had better frozen fish from the supermarket. My wife seemed to enjoy her shrimp though, so there's that.Halfway through the meal, we notice there was sticky fly trap paper over every third table or so. We saw a fly or two buzzing around our table since we got in but then we realized there were so many flies around the entire restaurant. CLOSE THE FUCKING DOORS/WINDOWS and you won't need that disgusting fly paper around! I have never in my life seen sticky fly paper in a restaurant anywhere, not even in a bodega in the worst ghetto! that's some third world basement bullshit, certainly not in a restaurant charging $35 for shitty fried fish and french fries.After the first few minutes, our waiter was pretty much MIA. I waited about a good 15 minutes for a glass of water. We had to stand up to flag him down in this EMPTY restaurant while he was busty chatting with his coworkers. My subpar food was already cold by then, but it was so bad that I just decided not to care either way about it. I've always had a love/hate relationship with City island because all the riff raff from the mainland Bronx spill in, I'm trying to get away from that, and there are so many better seafood restaurants NOT ON City Island, I should've just went with my gut and avoided this place.AVOID.\"},\n",

One line is for fried, another for steamed, then another for drinks. Overkill. There was someone to direct you at times but its still a lot of lines, almost as if you in a theme park. The wait time thankfully, was not long. We ordered the fried shrimp with a side of french fries and a side of whiting fish. The shrimp and fries were pretty good, needed a little more seasoning but still edible. The tartar sauce \\xa0also could've used a little pizzaz, but it did the job. The whiting fish however, was bland. It tasted as if they just cleaned it and fried it, no salt or anything for taste, so disappointing. Overall, its a nice place to visit for a casual date or family night out, keep your expectations calm. I would return in the future.\",\n",

We went early Sunday, as soon as they opened so it was as busy but in an hour or so it became busy. We got lucky to not wait too long for food.The side options are limited. Most dinners all come with French fries so if you want something else you'll need to order it. My broil lobster was so juicy it was totally worth the extra few minute wait. More waiting would be required if it is super busy.Seating is available between inside and outside as well as parking.It is cash only.\",\n",

But hubby is Puerto Rican and grew up eating at cuchifritos. He decided on a Lunch pickup for us and eat in the car while we waited for our names to be called to do our taxes. Really don't know what the place looks like- but hubby went all in for a Morcilla (Blood Sausage), 2 Alcapurrias (made of Green Plantains & Yautia Stuffed W/ Meat then fried- which he liked) and a Bacalaito (Cod Fish Fritter). I just settled on Yuca with Onions. Honestly, I'm so damn picky about Cod Fish Fritters- I can't eat them from just anybody. Plus Puerto Rican and Dominican ways of Cooking and Seasonings- differ quite a bit. According to hubby, one bite of the Morcilla- threw him off and trashed the entire thing, the Cod Fish Fritter- was just like I imagined and still drenching in oil- ewwww. Yuca? Well...you can't mess up boiled Root Vegetables with Onions in Vinegar and Oil (can you?). Even my Passion Fruit Juice was watered down. Why??? Good try. But nahhh. Hubby hasn't eaten at a cuchifritos in ages and not even sure if he needs to back off from the stuff he grew up on. But listen- other folks love this place and has 4 stars for a reason.\",\n",

It's literally touching and everything is home made and what's another for fresh? Hmm whatever that is it's 100% better than that. The fiancée and myself don't eat pork so Nook has it clearly posted that they don't use pork in any of their dishes. The father and son were just so nice but tbt star of this business is the Mom who worked in a bakery for 20 years and took a leap of faith to open her own business. I wish her and the family much success bc this good is beyond good.Try the walnut French toast which literally had walnuts in every bite. The beef bacon is OMG OMG OMG good.

A slightly hidden gem, I say slightly because it's well known by those whom had the opportunity to visit but not by everyone else. They are also on the park department's website and have their own site. So Wave Hill is not exactly hiding. Lol. I must admit I've learned of this beautiful gem some time ago and just never ventured over. Unless you leave in the vicinity of the Riverdale area I must forewarn you it can be quite a bit of a trek, especially if you don't drive. However, I will go as far to say that is part of this park's beauty, romance and allure. Perfect for families (even the little ones), friends and couples. WaveHill feels like the door to a portal, where everything is green, lush, and peaceful. With amazing views of the river, the bridge and wonderfully blooming flowers in Spring & Summer and great changes of foliage colors in the Fall. Wave Hill is of course is on a smaller scale then the famed Central Park or the notable Botanical Gardens but by no means do you miss out on any of nature's wonder. This park offers visitors, a green house, garden house and a plethora activities and events for everyone. On the day of my visit there were a group of yogis in their bliss on one of the main lawns. There is also seating throughout the grounds, gray wood crafted seats for you to just relax and enjoy your own personal serenity if you so choose. You can become a member or pay as you go, however there are many things you can access for free. The park has a parking lot which I believe is at a cost of $8 dollars and be aware it is small so it fills up quickly. As alternative there is a shuttle you can take to avoid the congestion or the search for a spot. I strongly recommend you visit their site to see and learn all of what Wave Hill has to offer.Just A Note: You are allowed to bring food & snacks but signs say no picnicking. So be modest and don't bring Boo Boo and your picnic baskets.\",\n",

Highly recommended! Great food and good service. Good times! Overall rating: A++***THIS PLACE IS CASH ONLY!!!*** Three friends and I came here on Sunday at 12:30pm for brunch. Many free parking spots on the street that day. My friend called and made us a reservation for brunch a few weeks in advance. Brunch is served as an all-you-can-eat buffet. Brunch also comes with unlimited coffee for just $22.95 plus tax and tip! What a bargain! Mimosas are $5 each extra. There is a staffed omelet station in the back sometimes but I didn't use it. We sat in the back patio and it was very nice. I wish there were more umbrellas and some of the chairs were more comfortable though. It seems like most of the customers were sitting on the patio. So come early if you want to get a nice shady spot out on the patio. I barely saw any people inside unless they were waiting on the line to get food from the buffet. Service was very good they came by to check on us often. The problem is you need to make sure you don't overeat. When I was there at the hot stations, I saw they had bacon, sausage, kind of dry and burned French toast, bread pudding(?) with raspberry sauce, slightly burned pancakes, scrambled eggs, breakfast potatoes, gross corned beef hash(?), and weirdly sweet and hot sausages and peppers. Later on they replaced the sausage and peppers with fried chicken, which was a much better option. At the cold station they had various fruits, yogurts, grilled vegetables, mini creme brulees, flan, cinnamon buns, and bagels. My favorites were the bacon, pancakes, fried chicken, bread pudding, and watermelon. I'm sure I'm forgetting a bunch of items since there was such a big variety! It ended up being about $34 per person (including brunch and one mimosa for each person) after tax and tip.I really like that this place is nice and cozy without being too noisy/crowded. It is a great place to come and catch up with friends! There are two unisex bathrooms right before you get to the patio. They're very small though. All in all everyone had a great time. We had our fill of delicious foods as well as tasty mimosas. I would definitely return here in the future for brunch!

I loved the bean and cheese pupusa, chicken and cheese pupusa, and the chicken taco. The fried chicken taco actually wasn't too good. The chicken is white meat and flavorful. The beans were perfectly prepared. The lettuce and tomatoes were also flavorful and en pointe. Prices were super cheap. The interior of this place is no nonsense. I also loved the selection of hot sauces. This spot is right near the Bronx Zoo and the food is better and more affordable than anywhere inside the zoo.\",\n",

My friend who doesn't like calamari asked for it to be subbed with extra scallop instead, which he informed us they may only give you 2 extra, which was fine since she's gonna eat zero calamari. \\xa0Her order comes to the table with a mound of calamari, \\xa0Victor then tried to explain how they likely just left the calamari also (really Victor??)

And the crabcake, worst ever, one side totally overcooked, had to return it. The manager tried to explain they were pan fried, looked like that were slapped right on top of a griddle and left to fry. The best thing on the table was the complimentary cornbread. And the reason for the 1 star...is Salmen, who i believe is a table busser.

Are you ready? ::drum roll:: If you want a delightful stress-free Mothers' Day dinner, get thee to Sea Shore on City Island the Saturday evening BEFORE the actual holiday!Full disclosure: being from Bklyn, i know almost nothing about City Island, so a dear Bronx friend recommended Sea Shore when it seemed so many of the area restaurants had mixed reviews, even when i cross-referenced with Google Reviews. But she told me that with Sunday being Mothers' Day, it was gonna be madness! So - i'm no fool, i took her advice and made a reservation for an early Saturday dinner.Lemme spare you a long azz story: Dining at Sea Shore was truly wonderful. * Getting on the island wasn't a hassle cuz we didn't wait to celebrate on the actual Mothers' Day, so traffic wasn't terrible;* Elizabeth the server provided world class service - we felt so cared for as she was quick, attentive, intuitive , and really went above and beyond to be hospitable;* The seafood was fresh, well-seasoned, and filling (either share with someone or you'll have mad leftovers). i personally recommend the steamed crab as well as the Linguini Langostino with garlic sauce and my young nephew thoroughly enjoyed his baby back ribs;* The ladies' room was so clean with a cheerful attendant; and * They have free valet parking!*Tip: It helps to make reservations. We had a 5:30pm rez, rolled up at 5:20pm, and were getting our drink orders by 5:35. AND we were back in Brooklyn by 8:30pm! #gañandoTL/DR: Delicious food, quick and lovely service (even on a hectic Saturday evening), nice and clean dining area, free valet parking.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': 'It makes me sad to write a negative review of this popular City Island institution. It\\'s part of the community\\'s fabric and I know that so many Bronx locals and tourists come here for special occasions and family gatherings. HOWEVER, for as much as this restaurant overcharges for mediocre, frozen--and I might even go as far as saying imitation--seafood, it deserves to be called out. (Note: This review does not reflect the service. I was very happy with the service we received.) Here\\'s my experience in a nutshell if you don\\'t feel like reading the full review: We finished only half of the appetizer (couldn\\'t stomach the imitation or frozen calamari), then, after taking a few bites of our equally imitation or frozen main course (conch salads), politely sent the dishes back and asked for the check. Yes, it was that bad. (I\\'ve never sent food back at a restaurant.)The full experience:My hubby and I went on a Sunday afternoon and ordered the Fried Calamari appetizer ($17.95) and Cold Scungilli (conch) Salads ($21.95 each). Let\\'s first talk about the calamari. At $17.95, one would expect crispy, FRESH, well-seasoned squid with an equally delicious (and special) sauce. What we got was either frozen or (more likely) imitation squid. How do I know? Every ring was the same shape and size (natural squid varies in size when cut up), there were no tentacle pieces and the consistency was that of crabstick, which is a totally processed imitation crab made of leftover pressed fish parts. The crazy thing is, even the worst food can taste good when given a good fry, right? Not in this case. The fry was soggy, not well seasoned (Red Lobster probably seasons its fried food better), and the red dipping sauce was like a basic, straight-out-of-a-jar variety.Also, here\\'s some context on price for quality. Oceana, one of Manhattan\\'s top seafood restaurants, charges $19 for a fried calamari appetizer. Read: \"Manhattan\\'s TOP seafood restaurants.\"Their calamari is fresh, flavorful, crispy and comes with a very special dipping sauce (not what tastes like straight out of a can). The Scungilli (conch) Salads at $21.95. The salad itself was large and the amount of conch on it was very generous. The conch itself, I\\'m guessing was also frozen, though, because it had that watery consistency that comes from being defrosted. Also, it lacked that certain crunch and meatiness that fresh conch has. Lastly, similar to the squid, every piece was identical.It was seasoned with oil and Italian herbs and had no taste otherwise. The dressing was served in a plastic cup on the side. My hubby and I both took a few bites and honestly couldn\\'t bare to eat the rest. It looked fake. It tasted fake. And as sad as I am to say it, we were just grossed out.We\\'re not food snobs. We\\'re not \"foodies.\" And we certainly don\\'t discriminate when it comes to food or restaurants. 2 hours before visiting Sea Shore, my hubby was at Orchard Beach eating a hamburger from the Food Shack there. No complaints there. This review is about one thing: Price for quality. I \\'get\\' that this is a tourist trap-type of place that inflates its prices because of its location. But for such inflated prices, AT LEAST serve up fresh (and at the very least, REAL) seafood and put a little more effort into \\'taste\\' itself.P.S. We gave our server a hefty tip for the trouble and apologized for the inconvenience.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Let me start by saying that since it was Father's Day, I did not expect the best restaurant experience but today was a shocker. I've been here a couple times before due to the nostalgia factor from my parents but I find the food mediocre as with the service.We started with a thirty minute wait which led to a discussion with the staff about sitting outside where we were seated immediately. We were brought to a table with one chair and nothing on the table except for a pitcher of water. The hostess awkwardly fumbled around to grab chairs from a nearby empty table as we maneuvered around each other as if a circus act. After being seated and given our menu, we did not see our waitress for fifteen minutes before we got water. This process repeated in this order after getting the water: bread, got our order taken, salad, appetizer, and mains.The bread served in the beginning comes with other items like cheese cubes, olives and others. The bread itself is warm and soft and thats all that I have to say about this part. The salad is a sad mess of lettuce, crumbles of croutons, two slices of what I assume is canned oranges, and two tomatoes. For the appetizers, we ordered the lobster bisque and a dozen oysters. So the lobster bisque tasted as if Cheez-its were melted down and made into a soup and the people I was with had the same sentiment. It was overpowering and the two pieces of lobster in the entire soup made me wonder why it had the name it did. The oysters we ordered were the only real saving grace of our meal but can you really ruin oysters? The bad part is that at the end when our check came, we found out we were given the blue point oysters charged at 3.50 a piece instead of the dozen for 20 that was listed on the menu. The waitress simply said we did not have the ones you asked for and only the blue point. No apology at all and we were charged for what an item that was different from what we ordered.The mains. Oh the mains. I was not feeling seafood cause I've had it plenty of times here so I got the ribs and shrimp scampi. Ribs were lathered in a very sweet barbecue sauce that made the whole dish unpleasant. One person got the steak which was not cooked at the level requested and was underseasoned. The seafood marinara that we ordered had a gritty taste, most likely from not washing the shelled items properly. Overall, a very disorganized place with subpar food. Really can't recommend to stop by this establishment. There are plenty of other places to visit along the island.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'My family came here on a beautiful Saturday night. This is one of the few restaurants on Arthur Ave. with sidewalk dining. The place is small and inviting with the feeling of a small bistro in Italy. We\\'ll get down to it. The place was a borderline 2 star experience overall, but I boosted it for it\\'s large portions and fair prices. Appetizers: Baked clams were very good and fresh. We also ordered the fried artichokes. They came out crispy, but were under seasoned. The only accompaniment for them was an odd choice of Russian Dressing smeared on the plate. Just a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkle of sea salt would have been perfect, Russian Dressing..ah no. We also ordered a flatbread with Arugala, Buffalo Mozzarella and Proscutto. It was very tasty, but the crust was store bought pita bread cut into rectangles and toasted. A bit odd for an Italian restaurant in the heart of Arthur Ave.Main Courses: My wife had Eggplant Parmesan, which she said was tasty and a good sized portion. My daughter had Chicken Parmesan which she enjoyed, And I had a special Veal Milanese, which was a whole bone-in Veal chop pounded and breaded and fried topped with fresh salad. It was huge and good, although similar to the artichokes under seasoned. It definitely needed salt.My other daughter\\'s dish was an issue, She ordered an Italian Dumpling dish that was on the special\\'s menu. We know this was the correct dish ordered because we had questions about it which the waiter answered before confirming the order. Somehow her dish came out and was Rigatoni and Shrimp. Fair enough, mistakes are made. The waiter came over and insisted that was what we ordered - - even after reminding him of the conversation about how the \"Dumplings\" are made. He then told us it would take time to make another dish, as if we were supposed to accept their mistake. After having to insist on the correct dish, which a customer should never have to do, we were told that the owner was going to get the dumplings for dinner but they will make it for us instead. I\\'m sorry, the owner? Am I supposed to feel some sort of gratitude that the customer comes first? Well after only 5 minutes the dish came out. And she enjoyed it. He should have simply said \"I\\'m sorry, let me get you the right dish.\"We decided to order some desserts. We ordered 3 items to share, A Pistachio Tartufo of sorts, profiteroles and Panna Cotta. the waiter came back and said they were out of Panna Cotta, so we didn\\'t have that, but then when the bill came they charged us for the Panna Cotta \\xa0-- AND THE WRONG RIGATONI DISH. The waiter didn\\'t return and instead we had to flag down the food runner. They removed the charges, but why did we have to sit there trying to get someone\\'s attention (there were only 2 occupied tables in the entire place)?While these issues irked us, at the end of the day it was a nice setting, the food overall was good, the prices reasonable and the portions were large.

One of us had called earlier to try to make a reservation, but there was no answer, so we had to wait and that\\'s annoying. Anyway, once seated upstairs, we were very confused by the set-up, as no waiter appeared for about fifteen minutes to greet us, explain our options, and answer our questions. We finally tracked someone down and made them answer our questions: they said that we could eat at the buffet for $35 or order off the menu. Cool, but no one had brought us menus, so we didn\\'t know that was even a thing. Seriously, the service here is some of the worst I\\'ve ever witnessed. How are you not even going to greet your patrons or give them menus? Some of us did the buffet deal, and I\\'m not sure it was worth it, as they only got one plate and the food wasn\\'t even good. Think pasta, bacon, rice, fruit, veggies, eggs, etc. The rest of us ordered a la carte, and here\\'s where it gets worse. I ordered a Toscana salad, which not only took an entire hour to arrive, but also didn\\'t taste fresh when it finally came. It was huge, but it really wasn\\'t to my liking. I asked for it to go and gave it away later. Friends got the fried calamari, which to me was beyond tasteless, and the chicken fingers, which came with fries, but my friend said it came out cold. So even the items we ordered were not the saving grace to this pitiful excuse for a restaurant. We weren\\'t even brought out water, and we had to ask a few times to get some for the table. And when you do get water here, be sure to check it before drinking, because I wouldn\\'t be surprised to find something floating in it. On top of it all, they don\\'t even offer skim milk, almond milk, or soy milk. How are you going to offer brunch and not offer milk alternatives for your coffee?Tosca seems like the kind of place you bring your mom to for brunch. There were a couple of birthday sing-alongs happening, too. I don\\'t feel that people dining here care for food quality. The buffet didn\\'t even look better than diner food. Besides the food, the service is truly awful, the restaurant is severely understaffed, and the wait for a la carte meals is horrendous. I can\\'t believe we didn\\'t even get acknowledgements, let alone apologies, for how long it took. The takeaway is to come here only if you want to do the buffet and want to drink a lot, because then, you could get your money\\'s worth.

Let me say, I have been to the establishment before and the food and customer service have been good. This could\\'ve been an extremely off day. We decided to go to the restaurant for their Rum Punch Brunch (basically a brunch/day party) My friends showed up at 2:20 and were seated at 2:50 by the host, initially they asked if they could be served mimosas (while they waited) since unlimited drinks were included in the price. They were told that they could not, because they needed to be seated. Why would that make a difference if the unlimited drinks were going to be stopped at 4 PM, and you paid upon entry ? When we sat at the table she said \" well, we about to stop serving drinks now anyway, it ends at 3PM\". Why wouldn\\'t you communicate that upfront, shows a lack of customer service ? Also, this was totally conflicting to what was posted online by the owner, the flyer said 4 PM. (there were two flyers on his page, one said 3 PM and the other 4 PM). Whose error is that? Making the best of the situation we processed to get food from the buffet. The host was still in the vicinity, our table was then taken by three gentlemen. When we called the host over to rectify, her response was \"somebody should\\'ve left their bag there to hold the seat\". Why would someone leave their purse unattended in a restaurant? What was the purpose of the host seating you ? At that point we decided to leave and requested a refund. We also asked to speak to a manager regarding there being two different ending times posted online. The response was \"he posted the \\xa0wrong flyer\". Again no effort to rectify the situation.Another thing, if someone ask a speak to a supervisor/manager it would be nice if they acknowledge the patron when they arrive to \"address to concerns\", and not talk about you in front of your face like you don\\'t exist. That is very rude and unprofessional. I believe everyone is entitled to fixing their mistakes. This was our experience on this specific day.

The coolest thing about this place is that they have a giant Dong that they hit every time an order for a pie is placed. The decorations are also really unique and designed by many of the students themselves. Not only that, but the staff is the coolest and most down to earth people I have ever met anywhere. If you're ever in the Little Italy area, do yourself a favor and stop by here for some pizza. Absolutely nothing bad to say about it. One of the best things about this place is the hours of operation. Anytime I'm out with friends at a nearby bar or house party, we always always make sure to stop by for a late night meal here, along with loads of other people.

I have been a customer for a long time and tried almost everything on the menu so decided to post my thoughts.First of all Vaya is one the most reliable restaurant in this neighborhood. I always order delivery from Seamless and they are almost always on time. The delivery guy is very friendly. Second, it's a very small place, so if you want to dine-in it's probably not a good idea. It's good for take outs or deliveries. Like I said before I tasted almost everything on the menu and here are my thoughts:- The Vaquero quesadilla was very oily, I don't know if it's because of the meat or the cheese but it felt a little heavy.- Tipico quesadilla was much better, I guess it was because of the shredded chicken breast. The heaviness is much more bearable.- I only had Puerqito tacos. Overall taste was good but there was too much stuff on the tortilla so it was a little hard to eat.- Enchilada Rojas is my favorite, it's super delicious, you should try it!- Tinga Bowl was very good too, very filling and a little bit of everything. Overall it's a great 4-star place and if you live in this neighborhood, you should really try Vaya!\",\n",

The food photographs well it cat fished me. I have ordered the Tinga Bowl,Vaquero Quesadilla, Flan, Grilled Churassco Bowl, Chipotle Ketchup, Jalapeno Sour Cream,and the Lime Zest Sour Cream.Everything lacked flavor. You guys really need to go back to the drawing board. The portions are very scant for the price that you pay. They are charging higher prices which you would think that the quality of the ingredients would he high but its not. Its either going to be bigger portions for the price or better ingredients.The location is very small with limited seating. The Tinga bowl which was supposed to be chicken in a tomato sauce tasted like raw tomato paste without any seasoning. It was a dollop of chicken and whole container of rice and a splash of Pico de Gallo that lacked brightness and and dollop of sad guacamole. The Churassco Bowel offered up non seasoned chewy steak (felt like a chew toy) The only saving grace was with that meal was that I had ordered the the green sauce which helped that dish tremendously. The Quesadilla was as tough as a brick and very unpleasant to eat It did not bring anything to the table. The cheese in the Quesadilla was similar to Play Dough.I hate to give a bad review to a restaurant especially a mom and pop style restaurant but It looks like you guys lost your soul/identity. I was hoping to come here and experience what some people have in your older reviews but I did not. I did not taste any love in the meals that were prepared. I was so taken back the first time that I ordered again just to see if it was a fluke based on the reviews. Ladies and gentleman it was not. It seems you guys have lost that passion.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'We have ordered a couple of times from here, as it is very close to our home. We had two tikka bowls today and chips with guac. The order was on time-even earlier than they promised! I liked the bowl with chicken, beans, guac and salsa. \\xa0Even the taste is fine, still for me it is a little bit too much of a mix... Next time I will stick with quesadilla. The guacamole was fresh and chips was delicious. This is a nice place to order in the Bronx when you are looking for a quick Mexican bite.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': 'I agree with some of the reviewers who give this place high marks for customer service - our delivery order was missing the chips component of \\xa0Chips and Queso Dip Loaded (just got a container of melted cheese with churrasco (steak)), and the person answering the phone was very professional and sent the chips out to us immediately. However, the food that we ordered just wasn\\'t that good. There may be other options on the menu that are better, but we did not like the items we ordered. Overall, I would advise that you stay away from anything with \"Churrasco\" or steak. The meat was chewy, unseasoned, and just overall not delicious. I got a churrasco burrito (called \"Ranchero Burrito for $11(expensive!!!!)), and the churrasco was a fail....and it was a fail in the loaded Chips and Queso Dip (paid an extra $3 or so for the churrasco)...and it was a fail in the Argentino Tacos. I ate half my burrito, my bf ate 1 of the 2 tacos (which incidentally was $10.50, which means each taco is $5.25!!! SO EXPENSIVE), and we picked out all the churrasco from the cheese dip. The only non-churrasco item was the Tipico Quesadilla - chicken quesadilla for $8.50. The chicken was not as bad as the steak, but again, the meat was not on point. Also, if I remember correctly, I think there were tomatoes inside the quesadilla as well as other vegetables. Why? All it does is leak out and make the quesadilla soggy and wet, and who wants not-crispy quesadillas? Also, it seems like all of their sauces are sold a la carte. I had to pay for salsa, green sauce, and pico de gallo. How is that not part of the meal?! That\\'s just craziness, and actually kind of pisses me off to think about it again. Another issue was that all of the food was lukewarm/room temp. The only item that was actually hot was the chips that they forgot and brought on their second delivery. I mean, maybe the guy delivered to multiple stops or something, but if that\\'s the case, they need to figure out a way to keep their food hot while being delivered, b/c eating lukewarm food with congealed cheese makes the food a 3/5 before you even take a bite, IMO. Don\\'t get me wrong - I don\\'t mind the occasional cold pizza or fried drumstick straight out of the fridge like any good savage, but when I order fresh food from a restaurant, I don\\'t want it at room temp. Something that I appreciated about the food is that I believe the intention of the restaurant is to have higher quality ingredients than your average Mexican spot, charge a little more for it, and set themselves apart. I appreciate that, especially in the sea of garbage that is food delivery in the Bronx. I just think that the restaurant would benefit from revisiting how they cook their proteins (b/c aren\\'t proteins the most important part?!?!) and figuring out how to keep food hot during delivery. I\\'m willing to pay more for quality - but quality needs to taste good. Oh, and include the damn sauces, for crying out loud!!Final thoughts: The food wasn\\'t nasty or inedible; it just wasn\\'t very good (hence the 2/5 instead of 1/5). Also, the food is really quite expensive for portions that aren\\'t ridiculously small but are smaller than the average Mexican spot, and because it doesn\\'t taste good, it doesn\\'t matter to me that the quality is better or worse than another mexican spot, and the prompt and courteous customer service doesn\\'t matter much either if I don\\'t like the food. Taken all together, I personally will not be ordering from here again. Again, this is just based on what I ordered, and there very well may be options on the menu that are significantly better. 5/5: one of the best places I\\'ve ever been. Heaven!4/5: really great. I like this place! I\\'m going to be a regular. 3/5: pretty good. I\\'d come here again.2/5: not good. I\\'m not coming back.1/5: wow, that was straight up awful. Ugh.',\n",

Now, I wasn't aware that the pico de gallo and all that jazz comes pressed INSIDE the quesadilla, I'm accustomed to those condiments being on the side. Ordering this for delivery and the delivery man taking over an hour including calling me four times to ask me my address resulted in a soggy wet quesadilla by the time it got to me. It could've also used more cheese. The yucca fries were alright, but again them not being hot definitely took away from what could've been a decent side order.

We had already made decisions by the time our waiter told us the specials, so timing was a bit off.Service was friendly (our waiter was a little over the top animated) and attentive overall.We shared the tuna tartar (very good and quite spicy), the special grilled octopus (cooked very well - served over arugula with hearts of palm, olives and mandarin orange slices) and the hanger steak (over a portobello mushroom with gorgonzola, beets and asparagus - this dish was amazing!).We asked to have the dishes coursed out as we were sharing all of them. After we ordered I went to the bathroom, but it was occupied so I had to wait in a small hallway. I overheard our waiter tell the runner that the 3 dishes will be shared and should be coursed out, \"which sucks, but...\". I was confused - as was my husband when I returned to the table and told him what I had heard. It had no impact on our evening nor on the service/food, we just thought it very odd.

I ordered the corn on the cob and it was almost frozen.

To make a long story longer. The staff are clueless, and when we ordered a platter of shrimps with collard greens and Mac n cheese, it was sad and comical. First, these people portioned the plate that looked like they were serving an 8 year old. They gave me 5 shrimps that tasted good and well seasoned. However the Mac n cheese was bland and you can literally count that there were approximately 15 individual pasta noodles with the cheese that wasn't even melted or fused with the pasta. The collard greens tasted like it was sitting on a shelf between 9 and 12 months. The corn bread doesn't come with the meal like other soul food restaurants and it tasted like beginners crap. Finally we ordered a large drink and paid very large for it except that the large drink came in a regular size cup. Almost forgot about the yams. I thought it was just ok but wifey didn't pass them on that at all.

Collard greens nice and fresh a little bit of spice. The only thing I'm going to complain about is the Mac and cheese. It wasn't baked Mac and cheese it was pretty goopy and not any flavor, it didn't even taste like cheese. It seemed like cheap cheese and it just wasn't good at all.

I came here in my lunch break and to get some food and it was below par to say the least. I'll start with what I ate ...Jerk chicken wings with Mac and cheese, corn bread, and corn on the cob. Sounds delicious yes.... well it wasn't. I was highly disappointed when I opened my plate and saw my Mac and cheese had burnt pieces of macaroni and was tasteless. I looked beyond that and went to the wings ... the wings still had the chicken feathers still on it but I continued the chicken had literally tasted as if it was a dry rub with only salt and pepper. The corn o the cob also too burnt with a dry rub that didn't taste too good. So time for my dessert the corn bread, and that tasted nothing like corn bread. It was bland, it lacked the texture. Nothing about this meal said soul food. The reception wasn't well either the young lady who was taking orders was annoyed with the customers, when I asked for butter for the cornbread she looked annoyed and didn't even answer me.the staff that was cooking the meal seemed to be teenagers not the prestigious chef that was suppose to be in the kitchen. Not to mention they have no menu, only the board, so those of us who have trouble seeing bring glasses. They do offer beverages but the cashier didn't seem to know exactly what they were. The overall area is small there's a picnic table and a few stools by the window where you can order to eat.

Our server was very pleasant and the manager kept stopping by, making sure that we were content with everything.We had both, their guacamole and quesadilla to start, which was OK. To be perfectly honest, the quesadilla could have used more oaxaca cheese and the guacamole could have been a larger serving for the price. I ordered a Fuego y Agua cocktail which was bomb, and their steak and eggs which was a bit scant. The price tag of everything seems a bit of a reach. I think they feel like their in an upcoming neighborhood and because the area code is 212, they can justify those prices. The amount of steak included in my $19 dish was laughable.The food tasted ok, nothing to write home about and certainly not warranting their prices but their in a great location so I guess you're paying for NYC adjacent?I gave four stars because they have some great drinks and the service was wonderful.

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'Amazing food, probably the best Italian food I have eaten in a long time. If you go, you MUST try the meatballs, seafood salad, and the lamb chops. Great food, great atmosphere, I just wish Frank Pellegrino was still around.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'I think back to the line in the movie Planes, Trains and Automobiles where after a flight gets cancelled, Del Griffith says to Neil Paige, \"We have a better chance of playing pickup sticks with our butt cheeks than finding a flight out tonight.\" The same holds true for getting a table at Rao\\'s. It\\'s almost unfair to write this recommendation because once I tell you how amazing the meals are there, the fact that you might not be able to get a table will sting all the more.I won\\'t go into everything that\\'s already been written on the internet about the table system ... the tables are basically \\'owned\\' by people and they can give them away to friends, etc. if they aren\\'t using them. So essentially, this is a private club. Knowing someone who knows someone is probably the only way to get a table. There are some other little hacks you can employ, which I won\\'t go into here because they don\\'t always work.I have traveled all over Italy and eaten so many great authentic meals in my friend\\'s homes over the years ... usually cooked by an older Sicilian grandmother ... so I think I qualify as somewhat of an expert on good, authentic Italian cuisine. I am also not scared to spend all day laboring over a simmering pot of homemade sauce while pounding chicken cutlets in a hot kitchen. Let me just say that beyond the amazement of actually getting a table ... Rao\\'s served the most authentic and best tasting Italian food I think I\\'ve ever had.If you don\\'t have an Italian \\'nona\\' (grandmother) who still prepares her cooking the old way ... Rao\\'s will give you that type of experience. It is clear that all the ingredients are as fresh as you can get and the dishes are absolutely made with love. Sounds corny but what that means is respect for ingredients, made using a time honored recipe and tremendous quality control.The atmosphere is fantastic and there is an electric \\'buzz\\' in the restaurant. Everyone is happy here. Everyone. The staff here from the owners to the waiters seem like they are thrilled to be here and even though I am not a regular, they treated me with respect, humor and graciousness. I had a terrible experience at another restaurant slash private club in Paris called Chez Louis Amor which was considered one of the hardest reservations to get there ... the staff was rude, condescending and arrogant to \\'outsiders\\'. (and the food was average) Thankfully, Rao\\'s was the complete opposite. They made me feel I was dining in their home and the food was among the best I\\'ve ever had.Should you get a table here there is no menu. Someone in a suit will come and sit down at your table and ask you what you want. If it\\'s your first time, he will go through all the options for you. As is the case with most Italian meals at someone\\'s house ... there will be lots of courses. You are expected to try a lot of things ... don\\'t come here and think you\\'ll just get a salad and bread ... or an entrée. Just an example of what we (two people) had ... fried mozzarella cheese, calamari, pene with Vodka sauce, the famous meatballs and veal parmesan. We really wanted to try the lemon chicken but already we were worried about being too full. It was hard to resist the fresh bread and olive oil as well. You order wine by the glass or the bottle and the house red is fantastic, just like it usually is in Italy. All of the fried food was done perfectly. Lightly fried, accompanied with homemade sauce and cooked perfectly. Everything came out with perfect timing. One plate left, another arrived, etc. etc. There were two of us and the portions were perfect each time.The star of the show was the meatballs. You have to try these at Rao\\'s. They are hand made, pan fried and then baked so they are so juicy and flavorful. I\\'ve never had a better meatball. Another interesting dish was the Pene Vodka. As a huge fan of Rao\\'s sauce from the supermarket (I normally make my own sauce from a recipe I was given in Rome while helping an older women carry her bags at the grocery store) but when I don\\'t have all day to create a sauce, Rao\\'s jar sauce really is as good as anything you\\'d get at most restaurants. However, it was almost surreal to be eating the sauce in Rao\\'s vs. my own dining room. It is made fresh from scratch at the restaurant, but the taste is still remarkably similar to the home version. Trippy.Overall, I think you can tell that I\\'m a huge fan of Rao\\'s. I know I likely won\\'t get the opportunity to dine here often. However, I do hope to head back at some point and I am sure that follow up experiences will be as great as the first. Very rarely do you come across a restaurant where literally everything is perfect. Rao\\'s is that place ... you find yourself able to laugh louder, converse better and smile more when all the other details (food quality, service, atmosphere, etc.) are up to snuff. Anyone who leaves a 1 star review is someone who likely felt entitled to a seat here and could not get it. Once you\\'re in ... you\\'re in.',\n",

I had quite a bounty of deep fried goodies and I enjoyed every last bit.Hubby mentioned that there were a lot of young people working in the restaurant and that they were very nice and understood that he was fulfilling the order of a very hungry and very pregnant woman.

I am new to the neighborhood, but coming from Queens, I am quite familiar with various types of Latin cuisine. That said, I consistently pressed my significant other to take me to this spot and we finally made it this past Friday evening. My first concern was not being greeted upon entering the establishment, okay, I can deal with that, as I know how local neighborhood eateries can be on a Friday night. Once, we were sat it took a few, a few meaning 15 minutes for a server to greet us, okay, I see what type of spot this is, but it stays packed, so I can let it go. But the following I cannot.Ultimately, like many other reviewers, our experience was similiar, great food, sub par service. Honestly, I can look past the service, if I can determine the amount of gratuity to give. However, upon paying the bill, my boyfriend noticed the number of guests totaled 6, (it was only he and I), which it seems allowed for automatic gratuity. Now we frequently eat at all types of restaurants, so are very familiar with gratuity expectations. Ultimately, we were disappointed in what appears to be a method to charge automatic gratuity to unsuspecting patrons. Interestingly enough, the table next to us was noticeably upset gratuity was automatically charged, but this was before we received our bill, so thinking back, the same could have been done to them. Unfortunately, the server(s) hurt themselves, as my boyfriend was prepared to leave more than the 15% automatic gratuity, mainly because of the food quality.My suggestion if going to this place: don't expect a 5 star service experience and be sure to CHECK YOUR BILL FOR THE AMOUNT OF GUESTS TO ENSURE ACCURACY!!! As long as you set expectations, you will not be disappointed.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'Always past this restaurant for years and I finally decided to give this place a try. I walked in and we were able to sit anywhere in the restaurant. We were greeted and given glasses of water with some bread. The menu had fair reasonable prices; we had 30 minutes left of the lunch specials so we took advantage and ordered. I got the grilled shrimp with vegetables and white rice with a small lemonade. The atmosphere was great; two flat smart TVs and music playing. There is public parking across the street and it is located by two MTAbuses and under the 2 train if anyone wants to take public transportation. I would definitely return, probably come during dinner to experience the environment in the evening.',\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'I\\'m so tired, y\\'all.The ADA is a federal law, and it\\'s older than I am. The wording surrounding service animals is not ambiguous: \"privately owned businesses that serve the public, such as restaurants,\" must \"allow people with disabilities to bring their service animals onto business premises in whatever areas customers are generally allowed.\" If another customer has a dog allergy, both customers must be accommodated. If it is unclear whether an animal is a service animal, restaurant staff can ask the handler, but cannot demand paperwork or proof. It\\'s simple... So why on earth did the rude, condescending man at the front of this restaurant tell me that, despite having been trained on the ADA recently, none of that is the case? Why is he under the impression that I need to \"look disabled\" or be blind in order to be allowed to being my service dog with me? Why did he fell the need to smugly tell me that he would deign to let us in, but just this once, and that he didn\\'t need to read the law when I offered it, because he already knows it better than I, an actually disabled person, do? And why on earth did the entire staff completely ignore me after I was seated, even going so far as to say \"its coming!\" and keep on walking despite my not having had a chance to order due to no one so much as looking at me?Not sure what kind of \"training\" this staff got or how \"recent\" it was, but I can tell you one thing for sure: it wasn\\'t enough.',\n",

We walk in and are waved at from across the room by the 'hostess' who then points to a booth in the back, like, Go over there! It took them almost ten minutes to bring us menus and water, and then fifteen minutes to come take our order. All the while there are three waitresses in front of the bar chatting it up.And no, the place wasn't crowded at that point--it was just sloppy service. The waitress finally gets to us, and she has an attitude! Wait: You're mad at me for having waited nearly twenty minutes, and I haven't said anything yet?! And then it takes another twenty minutes for the food to arrive!What makes it worse still is that they build a 15% tip into the bill and I had NO INTENTION of tipping anyone when my girlfriend and I were treated so poorly. I felt like I was being robbed--I asked for the manager, and was told he wasn't there. So, the experience was really unpleasant. I will not go back and I would tell anyone, don't bother. Good food doesn't justify crappy treatment and bad attitudes from nasty wait staff.\"},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'More like 4.5 !This little Hot Pot Noodle Soup place caught my attention and decided to make a visit to the island. Was little skeptical but was really satisfying at the end as compare to most of the noodle soup place in Manhattan, this place does win! Braised Beef Noodle Soup: wasn\\'t going to order this as I\\'ve tried so many times in the city but nothing was really satisfying. \\xa0 Still tried as their menu is not so big, luckily we tried. The soup was very flavorful, the meat was very tender, and the noodle was right in texture. Fish Filet & Tomato Noodle Soup: my least favorite among what we ordered as it\\'s little weird for my taste. It\\'s too thick as Asian soup dish for me I guess. Pickled Cabbage & Fatty Beef Mini Hot Pot: the main reason made me visit here, you don\\'t see many good ones in the city. Really tasty and lots of ingredients! Love it! But it\\'s the best when you eat there, I had the rest to go and the pickled cabbage did make everything taste very strong and salty as expected. Beef Tripe Mini Hot Pot: the lady warned us it\\'s very spicy, usually I can handle the \"very spicy\" in Manhattan. But this was truly truly very spicy... way too spicy for me to eat but it\\'s good spice as long as you can handle it. Skewers - Potato, Broccoli, Seaweed: pre-made it\\'s cold but very good in flavor. Bingfen: interesting mixture of ingredient I\\'d say it\\'s a solid hot pot noodle soup place and quite jealous that it\\'s not in Manhattan!',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'I came here on a weekday evening.I think it\\'s very prompt and good for if you\\'re looking for something spicy while being \"on the go\".The price point is very fair and I specifically thought 3 skewers for $2.99 is a great deal. They have a wide variety of flavorful drinks, such as herbal tea, plum juice, and pear juice. I loved the flavor of the pear drink. For the skewers, my favorites were the fish ball, quail egg, and tofu puff. I liked the spicy hot pot flavor of the skewers as well and I would recommend them overall. They were cold though and I would have preferred them served hot. I also think if they had more meat skewers added to the menu, that would be great.For the entree, I had the braised beef noodle. The best part of this dish would be the soft, tender, and juicy chunks of meat. I absolutely loved the spiciness of the broth as well. I think I would have preferred if we had a choice of noodle as I typically prefer a thicker one. I also liked that the dish came with a boiled egg.I tried the zha Jiang noodle as well. I got a sense of the creamy and peanut undertones in the sauce, which I enjoyed. However, it was actually hard for me to pick up on the nuance of the flavor palette for this dish as I believe my senses may have been slightly numbed from the spicy skewers and soup. Overall, I had a pleasant experience and I would recommend this spot for a quick bite or a nice lunch spot. Its rapid service definitely is appealing. \\xa0One thing I\\'d also like to note is the name seems to have changed to Chongqing Hot Pot Noodle and I believed the name should be changed to that on yelp as well.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'First thing I want to point out is how hard it was for me to find this place. I was excited to try this restaurant out but was super confused by their name change. All the signs inside and out state that they\\'re called \"Chongqing Hot Pot Noodle,\" which threw me off a bit. The restaurant is more of a to-go type place, you order and pay at the register. There\\'s some seating along the window, in case you wanted to eat there. There wasn\\'t a huge variety of options for noodles so I ended up choosing the zha jiang mian or bean noodles which is my favorite. We ordered a bunch of different skewers as appetizers. My favorites were the fish balls and fish tofu and my least favorite was the potato. I just wasn\\'t a fan of the crunch of the potato. All of the skewers were the same spicy marinade and were served cold, which was a bit unusual. I also wish there were more traditional skewer options like chicken, beef or lamb. The zha jiang mian was a very unique flavor, definitely not like any I\\'ve had in the past. It was very nutty and a little spicy as well. I don\\'t really feel like it fits the flavor profile for zha jiang mian but I thought it was delicious, nonetheless. My friend ordered the spicy beef noodles and that was good as well, but I didn\\'t like it as much as my dish. The highlight of the dish was the beef - it was extremely tender and absorbed all the flavors of the broth. I was just sad that it didn\\'t come with more. Overall, I would say that the dishes served here are pretty good. Only thing I would change would be to have more options. A more expansive menu, or even just additional noodle options would\\'ve been great a great addition.',\n",

I spit out whatever it was, and found a piece of broken glass inside! I immediately brought over this to the counter, and astoundingly they had nothing to say. They just SMILED shyly, looking at each other without a hint of leadership to step up nor responsibility. Since then, I never went back there. I cannot believe how irresponsible they were in this situation, especially if I weren't careful enough and swallowed it, it would have been a severe medical emergency\",\n",

I had the braised beef noodle soup - the spiciness is the kind that burns your throat afterwards, although I was able to handle it so it wasn't that spicy. The soup was flavored decently, but there wasn't too much meat or veggies that came along. The noodles were thin and coarse, personally not a huge fan, but they did the job and filled me up! If you're looking for a quick bite for a decent price and size, this will do the job.\",\n",

It's a beautiful classy restaurant and much brighter than most of the photos on here make it look. I even tried a few things I've never had before. I'm sad that I forgot to take pictures of the appetizers as they were amazing! We shared a bunch for the table; the polenta appetizer, arancini, calamari - not my thing but the calamari fans amongst us loved them, lightly battered crispy and flavorful, octopus salad (one of the new things I tried and liked - surprised myself but it was really tender and melted in the mouth), stuffed clams too ... the olive bread is to die for! Everyone rated their entree a 9 or 10/10; Raviolis were delicious and sauce perfect, Penne a la vodka, gnocchi light and fluffy, my husband and I had specials - mine was the Lobster Ravioli with shrimp and asparagus - the sauce was perfectly seasoned and not too thick and the asparagus just al dente! My husbands dish was a pork rollatini with pork, prosciutto, and mozzarella and was delicious with a little caramelization; his side of cavatelli was the best he's had, locally freshly made and not thick and stodgy like most. Despite the generous portions we found room for dessert!! Coffees and cappuccinos, tartufo, cannoli, chocolate mousse cake (omgosh - so light and fluffy - the cake was as light as the mousse!), and the kids had the Nutella pizza - warm crisp pizza crust with Nutella and strawberries - easily enough for three!

I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised by this little place but I definitely look forward to going back again. \\xa0One thing to note, this is a cash only establishment so be prepared when you go.\",\n",

We waited at least 20 mins to get drinks, 2 of them non-alcoholic but the bill was$35 ....and they only accept cash!! (In this day and age really????).

We ordered and got our food that we ate with the drinks we got at the bar. The food was tasty but the service extremely slow!! There were several empty tables in the dining area and one woman who sat at a table for 4 for at least 30 mins after her meal was done. Meanwhile the bar area was packed!!!! I think this is a tactic to make the place look busy and make you buy their overpriced drinks. \\xa0 I had to wait for the server to pass to ask for a glass of water which she must have gotten from the bar because that took long as well. When we were done eating we had to squeeze our way past the people waiting to be seated when they clearly had space to seat at least 14 people! \\xa0The food was not worth the headache of all the waiting and i seriously don't think i will ever go again! \\xa0The bathroom looked nicer than the dining area!\",\n",

When we arrived we liked the fact that it was casual and not too stuffy. We ordered a French onion soup side of bacon and a Caesar salad. The Caesar salad was overdressed and the lettuce wasn't cleaned. The bacon wasn't crispy on the edges and it said it was a bourbon flavored bacon but didn't taste anything like it, The chefs failed attempt at putting greens on the plate was exactly that a failed attempt there was arugula undressed and wilted underneath the bacon. Onto the main course we ordered the porter house for two, Asparagus in the frizzy the onions. The steak arrived on a cold plate the juices were cold the steak was cold (no sizzle) there were four pieces of asparagus on the plate for the side and the frizzy onions were not appetizing at all, oily and not Crisp. I motioned to the waitress that our meal was cold, if you're going to attempt to be a New York City steakhouse then take away all of the sides and the steak and redo it. She left our sides which were already cold by the time this new steak arrived and it wasn't a new steak all they did was heat up our original steak. We ordered A medium rare steak, it was medium rare when It first arrive cold, however it was medium wellwhen I came out of the oven the second time. For $98 I would never go back to your restaurant. After sending back our food the waitress had an attitude and there was no reason to have one. It was not her fault that the food came out cold, however her attitude was a complete turn off to the rest of our meal we skipped the carrot cake and went home very very disappointed, I do not recommend the steakhouse. The pure fact that your manager did not come to my table to apologize for a cold hundred dollar steak, and then sent up a overdone steak in place of it which was basically just my steak reheated is completely amateur when it comes to the world of steak!

I ordered the snow crabs, with shrimp, vegetables, and choice of fries or baked potatoes for $32 or $35 and my son ordered the Salmon with choice of vegetables, fries, or potatoes for $18. Once your order is placed you are given a number that will be called over a loud speaker. This place is quite big and often very crowded. The normal wait for food is roughly 10 - 15 minutes.

You receive 3 shrimps (should be at least 5), what I don't like it the amount of grease that the food sits in when you receive your food, however the food does taste great and the seafood is very fresh. My son salmon was a decent size and was cooked fresh and taste great. The fries were even good; thin shoe string fries. You definitely get your monies worth considering the portion size.

After this, I strictly limited myself to rice and chicken (and I never eat the chicken there...i take it home and put it in the oven. Fast forward to 2017, their prices have increased by about 20% on everything (i.e. a large order of Jollof rice with chicken went from $10 to $12). Oh, and they perpetually run out of chicken. This used to happen at night but now it can be mid-day. I am writing this review sitting outside of their restaurant at 7pm. They close at 12am yet ran out of chicken 5 hours earlier. \\xa0ALWAYS CALL TO ASK THEM IF THEY HAVE CERTAIN FOODS AVAILABLE BEFORE YOU COME. I keep forgetting this. West african restaurant owners are so cheap that they under supply themselves to prevent having excess food--which in turn causes even more loss of $$$ (not the rational bunch). Unfortunately, there are not 100 options of where to get ghanian food in the bronx. I have to stick with these beings here.Also, if you like tender meat....do not order meat from here.

The fish was shockingly accompanied by a tasty and spicy sauce w fresh tomatoes. The rice itself was mildly flavored and was the perfect accompaniment for the fish. Paired with a Guinness Malta, it was a meal fit for kings and wasn't too harsh on the wallet. I do wish that the fish was deboned but that's a small thing. The place was crowded with many people getting takeout. It did look dirty and there was a guy dropping f bombs everywhere and I think he needed meds but that was easy to ignore after taking a bit of the sauce that the fish came in.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I am being quite generous with the three stars, but must be honest with my assessment of this particular Applebee's. The three-star rating is due to the abnormally long wait times for: 1) ordering drinks, and 2) receiving our meals once they were ordered. There was only two of us for lunch, yet once we were seated, it seems we were literally forgotten about. I had to physically get up from the booth and look for help. The strange thing about the long wait was that this place was almost empty of customers (after 2 p.m.), and I counted no less than five Applebee's employees in uniform walking around. Once the attendant came to our table, she was very courteous and took our drink orders. It then took another 15-minutes to receive our drinks. The female bartender seemed to by pretty occupied with a discussion with a customer at the bar, thus probably the reason for the delay with our simple drinks. After ordering our food, receiving it turned into another wait in excess of 15(+)-minutes. The food itself was well prepared, but the frustration from excess waiting cut into my being able to fully enjoy the meal. One final point is that there is no Wi-Fi at this establishment. I was given three different reasons from three different employees as to why there was no Wi-Fi for customer use. I cannot envision ever going back to eat at this particular location.\",\n",

The location at 1776 Eastchester Road in the Bronx is a notable exception....I was in town on business, and staying at the hotel attached to this Applebee's, and came down to the bar for a light dinner and a drink. The food at this particular location is about the same as any other Applebee's in Anytown USA. Consistently Meh, as expected. That's not really what this review is about, though....What makes this place stand out is the service, or SEVERE lack there of. I sat and waited at the bar for over 15 mins without being acknowledged...it wasn't that they were busy, the bartender was back and forth between feverishly texting someone in her phone, and mindlessly chatting with a co-worker...while I'm sitting 4 feet from her. Honestly, the ONLY reason I didn't get up and leave, was the pure entertainment value of watching the staff NOT do their jobs. When the bartender finally DID acknowledge me, and took my order, she got it 1/2 right. Not complicated, a Jack and water. My meal arrived cold...not that I could get the attention of the bartender to mention it to her anyway. Even the on duty manager is equally clueless. She chats with her crew, texts on her phone, and wanders about aimlessly, instead of making sure her staff is servicing what few customers are in this place. Totally NOT focused on customer service, or for that matter, even aware there are customers in the restaurant. While I don't expect to have my butt kissed by the staff at ANY restaurant, I DO expect that staff pay attention, and check in on customers from time to time. I'm a reasonable guy, I totally understand if they are slow to check in if they are slammed. I get it. These employees were NOT slammed....just lazy. I probably wouldn't leave a bad review if it was a one off experience....everyone, every restaurant, every business can have a bad day. I get that. This is my 3rd experience at this same location, with exactly the same experience with poor service. Furthermore, I spoke with a few colleagues who have also been to this Applebee's location, and they have had experiences that mirror mine. I guess it's NOT just me. I think the only reason this place remains in business is the fact that it's in close proximity to a Marriott hotel, and business travelers keep it afloat. If you are a fan of Applebee's, and find yourself in the Bronx, with a hankering for Riblets, I'd advise avoiding the location at 1776 Eastchester Road like it has the Ebola virus. The food is pretty average Applebee's fare, but the service is ABSOLUTELY abysmal. I know that I'll NEVER be back here again. My colleagues expressed the same sentiment.

AMBIANCE - very rustic decor with many oil paintings of Italian landscapes. Very traditional looking. Old school but niceMENU - traditional fare with specials enough variety for everyoneSERVICE- this was a 5 star item. Our waiter was quite congenial and had many amusing stories to share. FOOD - things were very mixed in this regard. The bread served was more like the kind you would get if you ordered a sandwich in a local deli. I mean they are next to one of the best bread stores on Arthur Avenue. For appetizers we had the octopus salad which had great oil and dressing but was slightly over cooked and a tad rubbery. Tried the mozzarella and tomato slices that were dressed well with balsamic and oil but the mozzarella was only ok. Again around the corner is Casa Mozzarella that has the best cheeses.ENTREES- I ordered the calamari fra diabolo that had a fantastic sauce but the calamari was also a tad over cooked.

We ordered Peroni\\'s because \"when in Rome\". To start, we split the Mario Salad, which was just your average salad with a dressing a bit heavy on the vinegar factor. Now I do not like raviolis, but when I was younger I worked at a place that used to take a van down to Arthur Ave once a month and load it up with as much frozen raviolis as could fit. After that, I realized that I only liked Arthur Avenue\\'s raviolis. I tested it out here and I was not disappointed in the slightest.

Parking was easy for us since we went around noon time, not too sure how it would be during the night. We got seated really quick and the waitress was pretty attentive. He got the chicken chunks with the tostones as an additional side and I got the steak mofongo. Both dishes were absolutely delicious. The chicken chunks were so juicy; I just didn't understand how it tasted that good when to me it had looked like boneless wings (without the sauce). Usually, if chicken is that juicy, it wouldn't be white meat but surprisingly it was all white meat! The mofongo was abosolutely to die for. I think it was the fact that they had chicharron in the mix that made it divine. The crispy pork skin was an added bonus to the flavors. I didn't understand what was happening in my mouth after each bite but I liked it! The steak, however, could've been better only because it was thinly sliced and over cooked. If I had known, I would've gotten the chicken. But it's okay, you live and you learn. Overall, the food was excellent and I would recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking for some Latin food. They do have a Mexican menu as well but I've heard that it's not something you should order there lol. The only downfall about this place that it was just kind of hard to flag down someone towards the end of our meal because it started getting more busy.

I am usually very reluctant when dining at these type of large menu establishments where they do high volume take out because the quality of the food is usually not that great but this was the honoree\\'s choice and because she\\'s been here a few times, I assumed we would enjoy our meal.There\\'s street parking and if you can score that, I would say jump on it rather than gambling with the very small, very precarious lot located across the street from the entrance. The parking pot is tiny and positioned weirdly with some steep hilly parts so it\\'s quite possible someone could ding your car whole entering/exiting a spot. If all else fails, back in to park to ensure that when leaving you have the least amount of maneuvers needed to exit the lot.We were seated quickly upon entering. Our server was very attentive at the start of our meal but he eventually disappeared. We started with calimari which was \"Meh\". There was absolutely nothing special about it. I think the best part about the dish was the simple marinara sauce that accompanied it.Now to the entrées which were a complete disappointment. Hubby had a steak that he thought would be churrasco but was a very cheap and tough piece of meat. It was served with a very simple veggie mix and yellow rice. My MIL and I both opted for the whole red snapper with shrimp and veggies as the side. My first issue is that we had no idea that the fish already came with veggies otherwise I would have had a different side. So we both basically had a whole fish, a skewer of shrimp and two sides of vegetables. But guess what...none of it tasted good. The fish was far from fresh. I shudder to think how long they keep proteins in the walk-ins. That fish smelled worse the longer it stayed on the table. It was horrible. The vegetable sides were bland, steamed and in need of salt. The shrimp were equally underwhelming; they tasted frozen over and over and over. Nearly my entire dish was left and I did not take it home. The fish was pretty expensive and they should really be ashamed of themselves for serving that to anyone. It was disgusting. Point blank.After struggling through our meal, we waited for our server to find his way to us. After our entrées were served he never returned. We weren\\'t sure if he clocked out or was on a break. After a half hour we were getting annoyed and started looking for the server. We found him playing the drums and singing multiple birthday songs to different tables. We heard the drums and chanting throughout our meal but didn\\'t think the servers were performing double duty. I get that you have your staff sing birthday songs to celebrating tables but the servers should be checking in on their own tables in between to make sure their patrons are taken care of or at least a manager should be making rounds to ensure that the rest of the dining rooms are satisfied. I eventually just asked a manager to get our bill because we were ready to leave.I\\'ll never come back here. You could not pay me to endure another meal.',\n",

I've also had the spicy beef which is actually pretty good, but not spicy at all. All of the combos come with pork fried rice which is average, as well as pork egg rolls which is also really bready. Portion sizes are average to large. probably enough food for 2 people.Service: Minimal, but what do you expect from a predominantly carry out joint.Eat in: small space with maybe 6 total tables and booths. Pretty empty most of the time so it's overall pretty quiet.Take out: all the food comes in take out containers so it's pretty easy and painless experience.Overall: decent chinese food. quiet, small space. good for carry out.\",\n",

They specialize in sustainable, organic, biodynamic, natural wines and farm-to-table produce that is sourced from the Hudson Valley. They bar is run by a husband and wife team (Will & Sarah) and a small staff (including awesome bartenders Helen and Renee). The space is really intimate and beautiful, and feels like a little local family where everyone knows your name. It seats approximately 30 people, including bar seating and tables.Tannat offers a changing selection of wines by glass and bottle, but old favorites tend to reappear. They also have orange wines, which I'd not encountered before. The staff will let you sample before you order and suggest new wines for you to try. You can also purchase a half splash (half glass) of wine.The food menu changes daily and typically includes a selection of cheese plates and rotating meals and snacks. During the evenings they also offer a chef's 3 course tasting menu, and there is always an omnivore, vegetarian and vegan option. On the weekends they offer brunch, and vegan/gluten free an always be accommodated. Some of our go to items so far are the Tannat red wine, Two Block Rock cabinet and truffle cheese from the Hudson.The bar also hosts a number of community events, including poetry readings every third Sunday, wine master classes and live music. The team and bar are really lovely - and very unique in upper Manhattan. Definitely check them out when you're in the area.\",\n",

They offer natural wine and genuinely seasonal dining, hence, their menu for both wine and food changes throughout the year, on monthly or even daily bases sometimes. I love that you can get something new every time you visit!The inside is small, covered with wood from the floor, walls, and furniture, creating cozy and welcoming atmosphere. It has a nice big open door/window at the entrance, looking out to the beautiful greenery. They are across from Fort Tryon Park, and only a short walk from the MET Cloisters museum. Most of the wines are available by the splash (half the glass), glass, or bottle. They have sparkling, White, Rosé, Red, and Orange. I love the idea of splash, this way, we get to try more wines without too much commitment. Since there were three of us, we each got to try two different kinds of wine, total of 6 splash of different wines. They were all very good, and the staff was very knowledgeable of the wines, so he gave really good recommendations as well.When you are having good wines, you have to pair it with a good food companions. They offer farm-to-table, working with small Hudson Valley farms. We got Basil Duck Rillettes, Jacuterie Black Truffle Salami, Persian Cucumber, Smoked Trout Toast, and Wild Mushroom Pate. They were all good high quality, tasty and went great with the wines. The atmosphere was very comfortable, relaxing, cozy and welcoming. They have great wine (and beer) selections from all over the world. It is a great place to try out new wines that you never had opportunity or even heard of. The staff have great knowledge of the wines, we learned a lot from him. He was nice and attentive, he took a good care of us. It was a very nice first visit, I am sure we will return for more in a near future!',\n",

I wanted to try an orange wine and was deciding between the two cheaper ones- I purposefully didn\\'t ask about the most expensive one cause I didn\\'t want to spend the money- the waitress immediately suggested the most expensive one and I was hesitant. She said very casually \"you know let me just grab a small splash so you can try it!\" So no where did I ORDER it, and I know the splash is the half glass, but the way she said it made it sound like \"oh why don\\'t you try it first before committing.\" Next- she\\'s telling me how the same grape in the white wine is better, no where have I suggested that I wanted white wine, AT ALL. She\\'s talking AT US about HER favorite wine. She walks away and says \"let me grab you something\" and comes back with a splash of her favorite wine. AT NO POINT did she even ASK us if we wanted this- NOR did she even bother telling us what she was doing. So when I got the check (after ordering our own wine as well) I ended paying for two of the most expensive glasses of wine on the menu that I never ordered! I bartend and that isn\\'t up selling- that\\'s stealing from people. If you want someone to try something and you don\\'t get their consent, you do a buy back, you don\\'t charge people for something they never ordered. How cheap.

Got steamed scallop and shrimp with vegetables, asked for garlic sauce on the side, fortune cookies and moo shu vegetables. Unfortunately, you have to pay for the moo shu pancakes separately which I haven't ever seen before, granted they're only $1 more but then you get six of them. I would rather just get 2 or 3 and not pay the $1. I opted not to get any :( Food game literally so hot I don't even understand, since its 20 degrees out and a delivery, but I was impressed. Everything tasted fresh and flavorful- however my shrimp and scallop literally = just shrimp, no scallops present?? Im so confused.

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'Finally had a chance to stop by during Harlem Restaurant Week. The Row was one of the businesses on the list with the better deals and the food was quite delicious that I will be going back! Like so delicious that I left and was actually raving about brussel sprouts! The green apples and golden raisins give the normally bitter veggies a sweet complex without drowning them in a sauce. The almonds made for a nice crunch texture along with the flaky crispy leaves that made you keep digging for another bite. \\xa0Even though everyone raves about the jerk mac & cheese let me start a fire by saying it wasn\\'t my favorite of the night. It was amazing as a mac & cheese. The combination of cheeses were great on their own, but I didn\\'t get much of that \"jerk\" taste. It was almost like I was eating a plain mac with chicken chunks. For entrees I had the pork chop and my friend had the pan/oven roasted chicken. Even though I was craving a thin greasy carribean piece of pork chop and felt disappointed when I saw this thick slab of porkchop presented to me, my disappointment ended there. The cut is a du-roc as the menu says, I thought it was porterhouse, but happy to be schooled on the different cuts of pork. Anyway for such a thick piece of pork loin, it was not dry and the peach ginger glaze was so good I wanted more. I was able to take a large amount home that my boyfriend enjoyed more than the lobster mac he asked for. The potatoes and the corn were perfect sides for this dish. For dessert I was able to order old fashioned peach cobbler and wow. I was happy I left some room for dessert because this was sooo good! It\\'s a thin layer of peaches on a hot cast iron pan giving you some crunch caramelized bits to enjoy. It felt light and not doughy so I didn\\'t feel gluttonous after. My only caveat is that the cast iron and pastry are so hot that my ice cream was half melted when it reached me. I love ice cream and the cold/hot variation of the dish was perfect for me. It was a Wednesday and they also have Jamaican nights on Wednesday in the fall with a live DJ. The specials are actually really good and though the music was loud I see myself coming back. May give the jerk mac another try as it\\'s a part of the specials. Finally, the staff was wonderful! I know there wasn\\'t many tables there when we arrived, but they were patient enough to let my gf and I catch-up before we decided on food.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'I came here on a Sunday around 1:30 pm for brunch.The atmosphere was pretty pleasant, not too loud, a little bit of a mood lighting or dimmed but it was not overly so. I ordered the Brussel sprouts ($10) and the Jerk Mac n\\' Cheese ($15). I really enjoyed both items, especially the Mac n\\' cheese. The top layer of crunchy jerk flavored crumbs appealed to me. There was a combination of complex or different flavors to the Mac n\\' cheese so I liked how it wasn\\'t \"one level\". The Brussel sprouts were just right but didn\\'t stand out to me as much as the Mac n\\' cheese.The only slight negative aspect I would say is I feel like there was no bus boy?

We sat down and I ordered a sangria from their happy hour menu. It was ok sweet but no real kick to it. For appetizers your only options are brussel sprouts and jerk chicken macaroni and cheese. We ordered them both after they told me I couldn't separate the chicken from the Mac as I'm not a fan of jerk seasoning. \\xa0They came in a small pan so its a lot. Needless to say I didn't really care for the sprouts but the Mac and cheese was good but very spicy. For entrees you have a choice of chicken, salmon and pork chops. I was disappointed that for this to be a Caribbean restaurant you would think they would have more dishes with an island flair ( oxtails, curry, stewed) but they didn't. We both order the salmon it came on top of black rice and had some steamed baby asparagus. It was ok....more plate than food. \\xa0For dessert your options are peach cobbler with vanilla ice cream and chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream. We ordered both and they were ok. \\xa0The service was very good our waitress was very attentive. Again it was just ok. Maybe I'll go back for drinks and appetizers.\",\n",

The waiter presented the Harlem restaurant week prefix menu, which we weren\\'t aware was going on but decided to participate. Came with a choice of an appetizer entree and one choice for dessert, peach cobbler. We ordered our drinks and our entire meal all at the same time. Appetizers came out before our drinks, which Obviously the bartender forgot to make and the waiter forgot all about. The worst part is that restaurant was not full at all there was only one other table seated besides us and 4 people sitting at the bar. Once we got our sangria it came with no fruits, when we asked our waiter where\\'s our fruits that should be In our drinks they stated that the bar was closing and she put the fruits away. Mind you we waited 25 min for our drinks to arrive. Bartender was \"kind\" to drop off a cup of fruit which consist of cut up green apples (sigh). Around 9:30 we were told by our waiter AJ that they only had one peach cobbler left and if one of us would like a parfait instead? We both declined and after a back and forth my friend suggested a $8 discount due to the inconvenience which he agreed on. By the time our food came out around 9:50pm we weren\\'t even that hungry anymore. Took a few bites took the food to go and my desert (peach cobbler). Now I wasn\\'t gonna leave a review until I just opened up my to go peach cobbler..(pic inserted), after all of this they should of said they had none left at all, because this looks Terrible.

We asked for first cut brisket (extra lean) and there was fat on every piece. The corned beef we ordered normal but it was a terrible cut of corned beef. It was a little bit of second cut (normal) and mostly inedible third cut. The corned beef was very fatty and grainy and just difficult to bite into and chew. The knishes were average. Nothing great and didn't have much flavor. Lastly and least was the stuffed cabbage. I've honestly never had such bad stuffed cabbage. I eat it every time I go to kosher delis as it's my favorite dish. The meat inside was tasteless and just very weak. Also small which was probably for the best. The cabbage wrapping was I don't even know how to describe. Weird texture, bad taste. And the sauce was very thin and didn't taste like normal sweet and sour sauce. I'd say the only thing that was truly decent was the coleslaw. Oh and the pickles. But we all know you can coleslaw and pickles at the supermarket and it will be good. There's a good chance this place doesn't provide as good quality and service for takeout orders versus in-dining. I felt a little sick in the stomach after the meal into the morning and my father said he didn't feel great.

Had this place bookmarked on my Yelp for a few months, and decided to come here randomly on a Saturday for dinner.Arrived around 8:15 and this place was PACKED. They asked me at the door if I had a reservation (I did not) but they said the wait was about 20 minutes. We sat at the bar got a drink and by the time we had our first sip the table was ready upstairs. Ambiance: 5 out of 5 The upstairs seating was nice, loved the wine on the wall all around, gave the place a really authentic feel. The overall restaurant was beautiful. Great lighting, decor and spacing between seats. Mature crowd. Looks like everyone is out for a date or an occasion.Food: 4 out of 5For appetizers, we got the oysters and spinach, clams oreganata, and the clam chowder on the specials menu. The oysters were amazing and fresh. The clams were perfect. My boyfriend thought the soup wasn't as creamy as he prefers, but every spoon had clam or potatoes in it. For mains, we got the Veal special, which had a delicious mushroom risotto. I asked for a medium well but got more of a well...some parts were a little over done but for the most part good. The risotto was delicious. My boyfriend got the linguini special with half lobster, clams and shrimp in white wine and garlic sauce. SO GOOD the lobster was succulent and fresh and so much seafood on the pasta to enjoy.Service: 5/5 From the moment we walked in we felt special. The staff went above and beyond to make sure we had a positive experience. The staff was beyond professional and polished. Even at the end of our meal we got a drink on the house.This place is a hidden gem. Beyond impressed. This place is basically in my back yard and I'm upset I haven't found it sooner.\",\n",

We were escorted to our table and our waiter Danny who didn't introduce himself rushed into the menu speaking quite fast and I couldn't get what he was saying. Usually we have no issues. Anyway appetizer and dinner was amazing. Our waiter once in a blue checked on us. It wasn't packed at all. It seemed he was more attentive to others rather than us I could be wrong. So we paid and left a tip of $5. We usually leave at least $20. So why pay for service that doesn't own up to it. Then another waiter brings us back the check holder and said that gratuity isn't included and looked right at my husband with (tried to be) intimidating demeanor and look. I felt why didn't our actual waiter approach us. I would have explained how his service wasn't satisfying and therefore doesn't deserve a good tip. He could have handled it more professionally and I should have approached the owner but my night was ruined. We didn't even get coffee or dessert because I was upset.

It did not disappoint. The decor is cozy and inviting. They even have plugs available for charging your devices while you eat at some of the bench seats along the wall.The food is good so far that I've tried. I can tell by the way they make the food that it's already better than the other options available here. Their version of rice paper rolls are refreshing and light. The pad woon sen although stir fried was also pretty light and had a decent amount of vegetables. The only negative I found was that they are a bit stingy with the meats, including tofu. Otherwise it's a tasty meal and a bonus for this neighborhood which can lack diversity of food options aside from the fast ones.\",\n",

The first thing I do is order a Thai Tea because in my experiences I have noticed if the Thai Tea is premixed or not prepared properly then the food is typically bad. I guess the reason being is that if they don't take time with the Thai Tea which is t the food then they may not take much care with the food either. The Thai Tea here IS GREAT. Not premixed, separates, smoky flavor, not too sweet, just sweet enough. Admittedly I like it sweet and with a little less crime but that's just my preference. I got the Pad Thai and it was EXCELLENT. Every bit as good as the best Thai I've ever had. Restaurant has a very calming effect. Atmosphere and ambiance is very relaxing. Lighting is great.

I said no and asked for menu. Ordered Pad Thai (boring, I know but I like it) Food came out quickly enough but was very bland, no peanuts or scallions on top and was pretty dry and flavorless. No one came to check on food until I was about half finished. Told the waitress it wasn\\'t great, didn\\'t have much flavor, and why no peanuts on Pad Thai? She basically just looked at me and smiled. I asked if she could bring some chili oil and peanuts (why do I have to ask?)Another person came by, Indian dude so I assume one of the owners (since they own the Indian place next door as well) I told him same. He said \"the chef is off tonight\" I told him that\\'s funny because I\\'m eating here tonight, and you are open. He made no attempt to do anything. Otherwise service pretty spotty. No one refilled my (empty) water glass. Check came, paid and left. They seem like nice people but made zero attempt to do anything about a bad meal.

This has become one of my go to spots whenever I'm in the area. As mentioned in the other review, they do have a wide range of drinks to select from as well as snacks/candy. Staff has been friendly.The only issue can be when it's overcrowded - there needs to be a system where the next person in line is actually next and not the person who cuts them off or can talk the loudest. It's not this place's fault really and more about the rudeness of customers, but there needs to be some order when there's chaotic times.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Used Captain's as a lower cost alternative to some of their local competitors for a family dinner for 25 guests. Booking the function was complicated as I had difficulty speaking with the right person. Other than that, they did an outstanding job. My guests all loved the food and servings were extremely large: no one left hungry. There were no hidden charges and the staff was extremely attentive. They served a cake we brought in for dessert, which was great. Parking on Morris Park Ave is always tough but find a legal spot or there is a high probability of a ticket waiting for you when you go back to your car. I recommend their dinning area for family gatherings but likewise, encourage the establishment to make booking a little easier.\",\n",

It just didn't stand out to me. And as for the service, I found it to be uncomfortable, missing warmth. When we walked in, there was no acknowledgement and they just seemed salty, almost obligated to serve.

The avocado toast is great. Although I do wish there were tomatoes and maybe some sprouts or greens on the toast as well. Their chimichurri tofu is delish and I can't get enough of the chia pudding. I've also had their rice bowl which was also a wonderful choice. While I have never been to the actual cafe, I'm inspired to visit in person based on my experience with delivery.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'Moss Cafe screams chic like no other! Place is decked out in whites, creams and natural light up front. Plus it feels beachy, clean, but earthy all at once. There isn\\'t much space to waltz around- but great use of the space, makes it cozy. With that being the case, Moss created a style all their own in Riverdale. I\\'ve had Moss mentally Bookmarked for a while- as I\\'m rarely on this side of The Bronx. But since I was in the nabe, couldn\\'t skip it. \\xa0By the way, you can\\'t kill too many hours on your laptop here- but there\\'s a designated time slot if you wanna power up. This is such an awesome cafe for many reasons. I mean...not only is style intact- but food is equally gorgeous to look at. FYI, there\\'s no Poultry and Beef on the menu. And no pork either- as Moss Café is kosher. I\\'m happy with all that!!! At least 98% of their Menu is Vegetarian, with a couple of Fish dishes. However I\\'m sure you can customize any dish and make it Vegan. Weekday Menu is broken from 8am-3pm/3-5pm, Dinner 5-9pm, with Sunday Brunch and Drinks. Walk right to the counter and order up. Hot or Iced Beverages are listed on large butcher paper and menus are on clipboards. Menu looks fabulous and decided on the Sourdough open-faced sandwich with Ricotta, Strawberry Jam, topped with Pistachios and a dusting of Cinnamon. Simple and Beautiful! Afhgani Chai to start was what I needed at the moment. And when I saw a Hot Chocolate on the menu, it just took those 7 little words, \"how do you make your Hot Chocolate?\" When Tess said, \"...Chocolate Ganache\"......I was sold. Plus- I can never pass up on an opportunity to taste Hot Chocolate. I knew I had to hit Moss when I was in the area. Attention to detail goes above and beyond - plus service was so nice. I enjoyed both my light meal and hot Beverages. Owners here have everything down to a Science- even with the soft \\'Chill\\' Music in the background.

They have a Taco Tuesday Special which was great as our group was about 13 people who all enjoyed the dollar tacos some sangria and also a bit of hookah which everything was priced very reasonably. I would say if it's a party of 10 or more they ask that you pay cash which possibly seem as people may have pulled a stunt with credit card fraud but they do have an atm onsite to withdraw money.

We made clear we were only there for a drink & hookah. Even though there were PLENTY of tables available during a Sunday afternoon (tables were apparently only for eating, yet many people only had a hookah and drink on their table) she made us go to the bar which was full already.SO not only was there no space for a hookah at the bar but we had already ordered a disgusting sangria and had to drink it awkwardly standing around in the lower level. We left right after that one drink. I\\'m sure they\\'re used to servicing the same local crowds and you have to \"know\" people to get better service or what you want.

On the contrary, service was excellent. In the middle of this predominantly Italian neighborhood, there\\'s Caribe Restaurant. \\xa0Stone facade exterior stands out from the few businesses on the strip. But I have to give Caribe some props for getting all fancy and stuff and trying to hook up their restaurant with a so-called rustic interior: exposed ceiling pipes- (not sure if this is intentional or not---but hey, I think they wanna do like folks in NYC), metal accents here and there and a \\'pot rack\\' ceiling lamp. But what really threw me off, was the freaking head of a cow as soon as you walk in with big as* horns and a reindeer head (in the back dining space) behind me. That sight, really wasn\\'t my bag of chips. At. All. And since when did Dominicans get on this freaking taxidermy craziness? I honestly thought I was in a hunting lodge. Anyhow, service was great for my party of 8. By the way, if you don\\'t know the get-up in some Dominican restaurants don\\'t take offense- \\xa0if waitresses don\\'t engage in non-stop chitchatter with you or have an ear-to-ear smile, it\\'s just how they do. However, our server was spot on- girl didn\\'t even take orders down on paper,- she just memorized everyone\\'s orders by heart and didn\\'t skip a beat when dishes were brought to the table. Offerings here are typical Dominican: Mangú, Fried White Cheese, Fried Eggs for Breakfast and Moro with your choice of stewed meats for Lunch or Dinner. Martinis? Nope. Forget it about it. Not the spot. Maybe a Sangria otherwise keep it straight up and nothing fancy. Portions? Ridiculously large. Prices are reasonable for typical, down-home food.

I live in the neighborhood and its a good option but they make a lot of business and I feel they should have someone (English speaking) to take food orders over the phone. Unfortunately I do not speak Spanish and when you call to place an order, the women are always rude, its extremely loud and sometimes when they don't understand you, they hang up.

       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Evo has fallen off drastically. My girlfriend had a birthday brunch yesterday and the experience was garbage. Hubby and I arrived at 2pm and the rest of our party was pretty late but I will say that the staff was understanding, never rushing us. We posed for pics in front of their step and repeat, enjoying the music that was blasting from the speakers while we waited for everyone else. Their brunch starts at 1pm and ends at 6pm so we had plenty of time to make the most of the day.We ordered our apps around 330p and our server brought out carafes of Sangria, Bellinis and Mimosas for the table while we waited for the food. There were around 17 of us and it took 45 min for the apps to start coming out. Mind you, the apps are VERY small. Their wings only consisted of three per order and they were TINY. The fried mac & cheese were three mini dry triangular discs of cheap boxed mac with a mayo/ketchup dipping sauce and some ridiculous parsley oil that dotted the plate. It looked a hot mess but since I was starving, I stole one off of hubby's plate because for some reason my app never came. The server informed us that the kitchen was behind and those of us who didn't receive out apps would get them soon. Over twenty minutes later and I finally received my bacalaito roll which was gross and fishy. I love cod fish fritters but whomever conceived this monstrosity should be shot. It was one super long and skinny egg roll sliced in two with cod fish and eggs inside. It tasted NOTHING like a bacalaito in egg roll form which is what one would expect and again, the dipping sauce was meh. So in total, I waited for over an hour for one nasty fish egg roll that I had no choice but to eat because I'm preggers and by that time, I was dying of hunger.They didn't even want to take our entrée orders until everyone received their apps, despite the fact that it was the kitchen's mistake in the first place that, 1. We received our apps SUPER late, 2. Some of us had to wait even longer to receive our apps after they screwed up our order and 3. Two guests never even received apps at all. We had to insist that they take our entrée orders because we didn't want to have to wait another hour or so for more food to come out.My first choice was their steak and eggs which they were out of. How exactly are they out of an item when they've only been open for three hours? I'm not exactly sure but someone in the kitchen is doing a half assed job with inventory, especially considering that they had THREE large birthday parties reserved for the same day, same time and I'm almost positive that the steak & eggs are one of the top sellers. I mean, they only have a handful of items on their brunch menu so you would think they keep a decent inventory of items. I settled for their Chicken & Waffles and hubby had their Penne a la Vodka w/Chicken,some of which I tasted and it was not good at all. It had a weird taste but when you're starving, you have no choice. Again, my food was one of the last to come out and on top of that, one of my chicken pieces was undercooked. Yes. Salmonella and I'm pregnant. It took another 30 minutes after I complained to get a new dish which was dry chicken this time but at least it was thoroughly cooked and a likely microwaved Waffle. Another guest ordered the Penne w/Shrimp and after they started bringing out everyone's food the kitchen finally realised that they ran out of pasta and the guest had to choose something else which meant she waited even longer for her food.The sad part is that the manager would not come to the tables unless we asked the server to send her. It was like she was ducking us and didn't want to deal with the complaints. My girlfriend's sister set everything up for the day and felt we were not in a position to complain because we were late to start but they accommodated us and allowed us to keep our reservation and the entire meal was a sh*t show. My girlfriend's elderly father never even received his entrée and someone had to share their with him. I think the manager took of the price of one person which I think was not enough. They never even gave us dessert. My girlfriend had a birthday cake but our brunch included a choice of two desserts and they never even offered but the staff was asking for pieces of cake. Really.Most of the staff was drinking, smoking hookah and hanging out while we're waiting for our food that wasn't prepared properly and some of which never even made it out to our table. The only upside was that the DJ was decent so great going, DJ7ONE8 for at least keeping us dancing.So we were charged almost full price for two missing appetizers, a missing entrée and no dessert which was supposed to be included with brunch. Don't eat here. Go elsewhere. Bronx Burger House, Bronx Public, Silhouette and a host of other establishments would have served us better with a true party atmosphere, way better service and food that actually tastes good...plus AYCD.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'I\\'ve been hearing good things about this place for years since when it was known as Feeding Tree. Either it was heavily hyped or things changed quite a bit. I came hungry one evening with my fiancé (who happens to be West Indian) and was excited to get what I thought would be some good jerk chicken.The first clue that something wasn\\'t right should have been when my order came to $28 for a large order of jerk chicken and two cans of Diet Coke. When the cashier told me the cost, I must have seemed stunned, and asked, \"How much??\" I shouldn\\'t have paid and should have just cancelled the order, but by then I was starving. The cashier explained that they charged per pound ($12/lb.) and it was 2 lbs. Already feeling cheated, I came to discover that the \"jerk\" chicken was...barbecued, burnt chicken with sauce that they passed off as jerk that we figured out was likely a mixture of ketchup, vinegar, and pepper. I\\'ve had good jerk, great jerk even, and I\\'ve also had much better chicken for much less. After finishing my $28 meal, I not only felt cheated, but I felt angry. If you haven\\'t had the pleasure of having eaten good jerk chicken or pork, you can do so and a large order should cost you around $14, nearly half as much as this mediocre meal. Some places try to cut corners by purposefully burning the chicken and pouring cheap hot sauce over it, then passing it off as \"jerk.\" Verdict: if I want good jerk, I\\'ll go to Gun Hill or Flatbush Ave. or eat my friend\\'s amazing jerk pork. Eating Tree is trash food by people who try to rip you off.Bonus: one of the employees chased this guy outside to yell at him because of the trash he left on the table. One problem: he didn\\'t leave the trash there and it was there way before him. So not only are they con artists with bad food, they also have no customer service.',\n",

Looking for something mediocre to finish with, we tried the gnocchi... dear lord, how can you screw up cheese gnocchi this bad? Texture was ass, dousing in truffle oil did you no favors, and rather than a decent gooey cheese they were soggy laying in cream and fontina. It felt like leftover breakfast cereal with the panko.

Everything we ordered was not fresh, bland, overly cooked and just horrific! For the price that you're paying for each dish doesn't justify the portion amount and quality of food that you are receiving.

I made reservations through the Yelp app after checking out their food pix and reviews. We had to modify the reservation and push it back a bit which was not a problem. When we arrived, we were seated immediately and the host was very nice.It's a cute little spot. I like the decor in the dining area. It feels old but polished with the vintage style decor. The bar in the front is small but it's beautiful. It felt like we were transported to the roaring 2o's. I love the painted exposed brick, dark tables and mixture of different chairs. It definitely gives off a cool ass vibe.They have a seductive drink list with many interesting cocktails. We ordered drinks and a few appetizers including, truffle fries, catfish bites and Mac & Cheese. I'm thankful we ordered so much to begin with because it was all very tasty.Unfortunately, my main dish left much to be desired. My friend had the salmon which she loved. I ordered what I thought would be a ribeye and for the price, I expected a legit, sizeable ribeye. Instead, I received something else. What they tried to pawn off to me as an almost 40 dollar rib eye looked more like a poorly sliced, thin NY Strip that they attempted butchering to stretch their inventory, but I digress. I didn't make a big stink about it. The temperature was way off in some spots because it was so unevenly cut and cooked that I just sent it back. I ordered medium temp and most of it was well-done/medium-well.If you know me by know, you know I don't reorder food once my order has been messed up. I'd rather grab something from elsewhere on the way home if I'm still hungry and maybe come back to the establishment another day, if it pleases me to do so. Luckily, the apps filled me sufficiently so another stop was not necessary.The most important thing is that my girlfriend enjoyed her meal. We shared some beignets with dipping sauces for dessert. The server overhead us talking about it being my girlfriend's birthday and he gave her a little candle to blow out which was nice.To the credit of the manager, he came by to check on us after I sent back my steak. He offered to make me something else but I refused and thanked him. Like I said, I'm not opposed to a return visit but I would probably only order drinks and apps. To slap on a hefty $38 price tag on an entrée item and to send out what was given to me definitely has me on high alert when it comes to the integrity of their kitchen. You be the judge (check the picture of my main). The steak was only accompanied by one hasselback potato and a few matcha onion rings; very unique sides but you know you're paying for that protein. I expected much better.To end on a high note, they also have a speakeasy called, Room 623, located below the dining area, with live music. I wouldn't mind coming back for a date night with the hubbs and maybe even dress up for the evening. I would definitely return.\",\n",

Whether you're in the mood for crab legs, shrimp, clams, salmon, scallops, porgie fish, whiting fish, red snapper fish, or even king fish, this place has it all. You can pair your steamed fish entree with either veggies (they have; broccoli, carrots, potato, okra, pumpkin, spinach, corn, string beans, and mushrooms to choose from all bagged up) or yellow rice. Other side orders includes: French fries, crab sticks, crab cake, fruit salad, calamari, veggie salad, or seafood salad. Even if you're not in the mood for steamed seafood, they also have a fried fish option which is served with either yellow rice or French fries. So how it works is that you pick up a basket and select what type of seafood you would like to either be steamed or fried along with any combination of vegetables. After, you hand your basket to one of the workers that will begin to first, 1. Wash your seafood and vegetables and then 2. season your food. I usually tell them to put all of their seasonings and make it EXTRA spicy. Please let them know of any known allergies! Next, they will put it in a steamer and give you your ticket number (do not lose it). This process takes about 25-30 minutes depending on how busy it is inside and what type of seafood you selected. They also accepts EBT and has an ATM available. However, you may use a card as a form of payment. Pros: 1. Great location and reasonable price 2. Food is always tasty and consistent 3. They have a large selection of seafood 4. They have somewhere where you can sit and wait for your food if you choose to do that5. You select your own seafood and vegetables 6. You can always call ahead and place a order for pick up. Cons:1. When it is busy, it is busy and the wait time is usually longer 2. Most times there are no street parking 3.

We also ordered fried shrimp and a fried red snapper. Both the fried fish and the fried red snapper came with a side of yellow rice, which we chose as opposed to a side of fries.All of our sides except the rice were way too over cooked. Maybe they can figure out a way to throw in the veggie sides in a little after the fish is in the steamer because they almost all turned into mush.

The first time was nothing to write about but definitely better than what we just got.We ordered a cheeseburger, volcano burger and tater tots. The cheeseburger was decent. I ordered it medium well but probably should have got medium. The volcano burger was ordered well done but was burnt. It's basically a cheeseburger but with a mound of cheese. We were excited to trying it being such cheese lovers. The cheese melted so it was like a pancake of cheese which was fine but it was burnt. You could taste the burnt flavor in it. The bun was grilled but the lines were pretty charred. So all together it was pretty bad. We called to get a refund and what made matters worse was the owners attitude. He said it was ordered well done. As to imply we should have expected it that way. Also tried to say it's a hard burger for take out. If that is the case then train your staff to educate the guests so they know what they're getting into. We didn't care that the cheese melted, just didn't want it burned. We ended up taking everything back since we still needed to buy food for dinner and didn't want them thinking we ate it. He seemed pretty upset we brought everything back, but still gave us a refund. Well actually he didn't want to be bothered, the young lady who was behind the counter assisted us. She was probably the most professional in there. The bill was only $26, it wasn't about that. The volcano burger was so bad it was not edible. Then the owner (or whoever the gentleman was) had a nasty attitude which didn't help the matter. We won't be trying it for a third time, we'll stick to Patricia's, which is right next door. We were actually debating between the two, guess we made the wrong decision.\",\n",

It was edible, but it wasn't spectacular in any way that it made me want to order from here again in the future.

And that's not the only thing that changed....Ordering delivery over the phone has become even more painful and irritating. 9 out of 10 times, I have to deal with someone who's either not trained to take orders, doesn't speak/understand English, or plainly exhibits poor customer service. In these cases, I just end up having one of the owners finish up my order. And as for when it comes to the owners, they're not terrible people. However, it would be so great and refreshing if the male owner can stop showing his frustration in front of customers and hastily bum-rushing them to the door, once their order has arrived and they paid. This has occurred with me several times and as a paying, regular customer, I don't appreciate this or accept that.

It was amazing that they were able to accommodate us on such short notice as we were unsure of how many people would be attending lunch. We were around eighteen people or so and when I called and explained the situation, they said we were welcome to come in and that they'd have a table ready for us.They have quite a small parking lot, if you're lucky enough to get a spot in there, otherwise, there is plenty of street parking but be sure to feed the meter in time because there must be a traffic officer on stand-by, just waiting for the meter to run out. The servers were ok. One in particular seemed a little bit frustrated trying to collect our orders and getting the right food to the right person. We had some personal pizzas for the table, to start, as well as a few salads served family style. I had a ribeye that came with a side of pasta. The servings are pretty big so you're definitely not leaving hungry.Everyone enjoyed their meal. We had a great table, out of the way but set up in a way where we were able to be social with one another on an otherwise, somber afternoon. I'm very thankful that they made setting up a last minute lunch so effortless.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"This has been a strange few months for eating joints near me. Some of my go-to places flat-out disappeared over the past few weeks/months, including two that I meant to review here. A while back I needed a delivery of comfort eats and discovered that my first choice didn't deliver without an app, my second choice was newly closed (I'd just ordered from there the week before), and my third choice didn't deliver without an app. I ruffled through my stack of menus and found Crosstown, which I'd gone to a few times when I was in the area. I went with bacon and egg on a roll for lunch and the Yankee pot roast sandwich (gravy on the side) for dinner, and they did not disappoint. Comfort food of the highest order! And I've ordered again and stopped in a few times since. They do a generous London broil platter, a nice old-school milkshake, the freshest salad I've ever gotten from a diner (serious--half of it sat three days in my fridge without skipping a beat), and what just might be the creamiest cheesecake in the borough. [Drooling.]I've found the service prompt and friendly, including the delivery guys, and had a cool time talking football with Bill, the manager (owner?) last time I took out. But I gotta grab a neighbor so I have company for the Irish breakfast combo with the black and white pudding...\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Crosstown Diner has been in the area for years - it used to be on my rotation back when I frequented diners but I haven't been here in about four or five years. Today however, my brothers and I were looking for some lunch, so we decided to grab a bite and rediscover Crosstown.Like many diners, Crosstown is bright and open. Even though the space is semi-compartmentalized, it flows nicely and has all the components one would expect to find in a diner. Because it's located at the corner of Tremont and the Bruckner Expressway, street parking can be difficult. However, they have a small parking lot that I've always been able to find a spot in. The menu is huge - both in selection and physical size. Like really - pages and pages, I thought I was at the Cheesecake Factory for a minute. I was in the mood for a wrap, so I turned to chapter 6 where they were listed. The southwestern wrap looked good, so I went with that. The wrap contained grilled chicken breast, guac, and cheddar jack cheese - \\xa0it also came with a side of fries. I wasn't too impressed with the wrap; the contents weren't really defined - it kind of all melded into one, and the flavors weren't big. The fries were average - I would have liked to have seen more on the plate. Overall, I find Crosstown to be an average diner. While I would normally give a place like this a 3, after looking at the prices on the menu I'm giving them a 2. A forgettable wrap with a few fries cost $14? Wow - you can totally get a better deal elsewhere. I think Crosstown does a great job with their social media and neighborhood presence, but for me it has to be about the food - especially at these prices.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Tried this restaurant with my family for the first time today and had such a great food experience! Premium Sweets is located in the Parkchester area of the Bronx and is in a primarily Bangladeshi community. Parking can be a bit of a pain but eventually you will find street parking. There is meter parking available (.25 for 15 minutes until 7pm). The area is very reminiscent of Jackson heights. The venue is very modest and has a simple set up with a few small tables and chairs in the back. The venue is clean and manned by multiple staff. The owner Mr. Khan is so NICE! He immediately greeted my family and I and asked us to stay for dinner (I've never met this gentleman before but I immediately felt and was treated like family). I asked Mr. Khan what he could suggest for a meal as there were a huge variety of items available because of Ramadan. Shortly after being seated, staff began to bring over a variety of dishes. We shared the chicken and beef biryani, various iftar fritters, & salad. The tamarind sauce served on the side was so sweet, sour and mildly spicy, and complimented the fried items. The beef biryani was delicious! The meat was so tender and melted away as you ate it. The salad was crisp and the green chilies on the side were fresh and fiery hot [just the way I like em]! After finishing our meal, Mr. Khan brought us dessert! The variety included jalebis, gulab jamun & kala jamun. All of the sweets were perfection! Fresh, soft, & sweet. The restaurant sells traditional Indian sweets for $7.99 a pound which are available in a refrigerated case in the front of the store. Next to the register is a buffet style variety of Indian/Bangladeshi dishes. Because of Ramadan, there were also trays of fried goodness available for very reasonable prices, varying from 3 items for a dollar to one dollar each item. We also tried the chicken samosas which were crispy and packed full of well seasoned mildly spicy filling. The chicken tikki were delicious too! The restaurant has a cooler with typical drinks, soda, bottled water, etc. Tea is also readily available. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant for the sweets, the food and most importantly the amazing customer service and the ever so wonderful Mr. Khan.\",\n",

Neither of us knew what a pupusa was and we were curious to find out, though the restaurant didn't look like anything special on the outside.We went to eat an early dinner there and were the only ones in the place. We were greeted by a little girl and her mom who turned out to be our waitress. She recommended we try the pork, cheese and bean pupusas; we also ordered a lunch special of tostones, salad and grilled chicken, a corn tamale and a limonata. The pupusas came with a tomato based sauce and spicy coleslaw and the tamale came with sour cream. Honestly - it was the best meal I've had in the neighborhood in a very long time. The chicken was well seasoned and tender, the tamale was sweet and perfect with the sour cream, and the pupusas were like eating a savory pancake. It was so good that we went back the next day and got palomilla steak, maduros and beans, and more pupusas.Service was friendly and we didn't have any issues with it being slow as mentioned in other reviews; however we went there at an off hour so that could play a role.We also felt that the food they served left a homemade, satisfying and warm feeling that went beyond a typical restaurant experience. As if it was made with extra love and care. Highly recommend this place! Don't judge it by its outward appearance; truly a gem in the Heights.\",\n",

Once you receive your food they don't even come and check on you so good luck if you have a dry mouth, unless you call them over they will not come to you. My last time there was last week, and literally is my LAST time there. As me and my family are eating a HUGE water bug is crawling up the wall right next to us, i begin to scream and the ladies as per usual are busy at the bar chatting and take their sweet time to handle the situation. A guy worker comes with a broom kills the roach and of course the dead roach lands on our table, he throws it on the floor and everyone goes on about their day. No one came to wipe the table, no one came to apologize, no discount was given or courtesy for the food we refused to finish. Disgusting and disrespectful.

Everything was cooked well but in my opinion $32 was a bit steep for the amount of food it came with.On both visits we did stay after dinner for the actual lounge. Around 11:30-12 is when the place really starts to fill up. You are forced to leave your table as they clear it for dancing and unless you purchase a bottle package they do not allow you to sit at the booths around the lounge.

If not for that, I don't believe I would have stumbled upon this GEM. Do not judge this place by the way that it looks, you will be super surprised to find out that a restaurants decor have nothin to do with how good or bad the food is. Or at least that's what you learn about this place. They have a great buffet with 25 different items which isn't what I really come there for so I wouldn't be able to comment on that food.....But in the back area is a man, standing behind a counter with 15 to 20 different rotating meats. Some cooked well done, some cooked rare, and all the others in between. He grabs a plate and asks what you want, then he'll grab the slab, cut a small price to ask you if you agree with the temperature of the meat or if you'd like to go more rare or more well done. After you choose he asks how many slices you'd like and if you want it cut up or not. He serves you your plate, puts a dash of salt on the end he cut from and hooks it back onto the big fire pit. The meat is the juiciest, most flavorful, fresh, type of meat I've come across at a restaurant in a long time. I happen to be something of a steak connoisseur, so peter Lugers, Bobby flays and Wolfgang's are regular places I go to for steak, and I have to say this place will give any of them a run for their money.

The meats are tasty and they provide plenty of different sauces and toppings you can use like chimichurri sauce, hot sauce, BBQ sauce, yuca powder, garlic powder, and some other spices/herbs mix. \\xa0This place can get expensive if you eat with your eyes. The one plate of hot buffet and the meat plate cost a total of $18 and change. The hot buffet costs $7.49/lb and churrasco is $15.49/lb. They also have a variety of desserts that were all $5 or less including tres leches cake for $3.25. Service could improve. There isn't really a hostess and you have to ask around to figure out how things work.

The menu is limited and pricey so many others entering asked about the special after being seated and got up and left. We opted for the calamari, seafood salad, seafood linguini chefs special, penne a la vodka and lobster ravioli. I must say the appetizers had the freshest seafood I have ever tasted. The calamari nice and soft, the mussels in the salad the cleanest, not one grain of sand and the smoothest slivers of oysters.

As you walk in you\\'ll notice a very traditional sit-down Italian restaurant decor. This place is huge and I can definitely see huge parties held here. Since we decided to go on a Wednesday evening there was absolutely no crowd (there were maybe a total of 6-8 other people besides us) and plenty of parking. \\xa0The staff (waitress and server/hostess) were really friendly and welcoming. They checked in on us a few times and made sure everything was to our liking. Our Groupon included: 1 bottle of wine, 2 appetizers, 2 surf and turf entrees (a lobster tail and steak), and 2 desserts. The Cabernet Sauvignon we selected was delicious (photo attached). We decided to go with a shared appetizer for an extra cost. It was the Hot AntiPasto for 2: Shrimp, Fried Calamari, Stuffed Mushrooms, Eggplant, Rollatini, and Baked Clams.If you are starving I would suggest this. The sizing was pretty large for us as I started to get full after eating this. The shrimp, calamari and baked clams were delicious. Everything else was just friend mush. Our surf and turf entrees consisted of a large lobster tail and steak. I asked for Medium-well (don\\'t judge me) and ended up getting a well-well done steak. I did not need to use the butter sauce as the lobster tail was extra seasoned. The veggies (carrots and string-beans) were cooked in some buttery garlic sauce I loved it. So I ate the lobster tail and veggies for most of my entree. Our deal also included 2 desserts. By this time we were so stuffed we did not even want to see the dessert menu so the waiter offered to give us the desserts to go. This was so kind and I\\'m glad we did not have to ask for it be wrapped up. The waiter offered this before we even know what was being offered. I asked and he named several cheesecake flavors.I am not a fan of any type of cheesecake so my date was about to have the bomb late night snack. We ordered a raspberry cheese cake and a chocolate cheesecake to go. Before leaving the waiter offered us some homemade sambuca (fig and raisin). It was the bomb. It was so sweet and strong at the same time - I loved it! Our night was lovely, we had a great dinner and all is well. Fast forward to the unwrapping of the desserts. We open the first container of the \"raspberry\" cheese cake. We notice there are no raspberries there are actually strawberries on top. Ok that\\'s fine. We wouldn\\'t have complained about that but as we go to get a fork (I was willing to try it)we notice some mold on one of the strawberries. We both took a better look at this and quickly threw the slice of cheese cake away. My date did inspect and try the chocolate cheese cake but didn\\'t feel comfortable eating it. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the wine, the amount of food for the price and I can so see this being such a great outdoor dinner spot during the summer but I\\'m not sure I\\'ll return because mold on food is not really a good look.

He came back about 10 minutes later, and said that all of the other seats were in use. But a quick scan of the restaurant, show that there were no other children in the place, who were using a child seat. So I guess the real answer is that they only had one seat, and it was broken.

My friend's steak, which (I warned her against getting) was truly like the sole of someone's \\xa0shoe. She had requested the steak be cooked medium, and it truly resembled a piece of leather. The eggs that she asked to include cheese, came cheeseless. And the fried plantains for her son were like potatoes: they were not at all ripe. The home fries that were served with it were quite dry. I requested ketchup, twice, and it never appeared. My tepid coffee was finished, so I asked for water. Instead. No one ever offered to refill my coffee cup, nor did anyone come to refill our water glasses. Then, the waiter appeared halfway through our meal with a plate of eggs with cheese on them. My friend was no longer interested in them, as they were not hot, Undercooked (salmonella, anyone?) and had a few dots of cheese here and there.When country kitchen was at this location, it was such a wonderful restaurant. This place seems to be focused on drinks, and witty repartee, but not so much on providing good food. At least not at breakfast. I think I will pass on it, forever.\",\n",

It described itself as \"Jamaican style,\" thinking it was like Chipotle being \"Mexican cuisine.\" I\\'m doing jury duty and took a chance on it last Friday got lunch. The set up is a small buffet-style restaurant charging $7.99/lb. or $11.99/lb. if you opt for their seafood options. I tried to go as close to 1 pound as possible to see what you get for that price. Friday I had some rice and peas, a few pieces of curry chicken, string beans, and some jerk pork. Today I tried the jerk chicken wings, provisions (callaloo), sweet plantains, okra, and Rasta pasta.The chicken was well seasoned. I liked the different layout of vegetable options to balance things, so I guess it\\'s theoretically possible to eat here as a vegetarian. I\\'ve never had Rasta pasta before, and am not a huge pasta fan, but the spiciness/heat of it was an interesting juxtaposition. I saw that served ackee and saltfish, as well as things like cheese and bun, carrot cake, Irish seamoss, peanut punch, and some fresh juices. I also saw roti on the menu, which I haven\\'t yet tried. I know a good roti when I eat one, so I\\'m a tough critic. All in all, this is probably the best option for lunch around here if you like variety and aren\\'t afraid of spice.

Mac n cheese full of flavor and baked so deliciously, the collard greens were smoked with some sweetness and so juicy. The beef ribs were falling off the bone and the BBQ sauce on it was so sweet and just simply something out of this world. My hubby had Yams and by far it\\'s the best yams I\\'ve ever had.

Ordered the food to go and while waiting I heard what sounded like a plastic container drop to the floor. When I received my meals I looked in the bag and sure enough the container with the peach cobbler was upside down so I asked for a replacement. Got home and realized the the replacement was moldy. I called and informed the restaurant of the moldy food, they apologized and said during my next visit I would be compensated. Well I decided there probably would not be a next time so I went back to return the moldy food and request a refund which was granted. The other foods ordered were ok, which included the fried chicken, whiting fish, yams, and collard greens. But unfortunately I do not believe I will return.\"},\n",

Amazingly bad.Best Part: Sweet PlantainsWorst Part: \\xa0Everything else \\xa0My Order (via UberEats)- Coconut Crusted Jumbo Shrimp: \\xa0Key word = \"crusted\". Dry, rubbery and tasteless. - Crab Cake: Under-seasoned, dry, + too much breading. Was there even crab in there? - BBQ Island Wings: BBQ sauce was tasteless and the wings unseasoned. - Codfish Cake: Those were fish cakes?? Shredded paper bags and basil, maybe. Just maybe. The smell alone made me lose my appetite.- Braised Oxtail Stew: Almost ashamed to be from the islands on this one. Needed way less browning and way more seasoning. Way more everything. Tender though. Redeeming factor? Not at all.- Garlic Mashed Potatoes: Couldn\\'t taste the garlic, no salt or pepper, plenty of undercooked, chunky potatoes. Mashed? Not quite. - Rice and Peas: So much thyme, it\\'s all I could taste. Not much in the way of other seasoning. - Sweet Plantains: Self-explanatory. They were ripe. Thanks, plantain tree! Silver lining: sweet plantains!- Green Glory Smoothie: So sweet. Had to pour out half and mix with coconut water. Silver lining: I likely cut the probability of a pre-diabetes diagnosis in half.- Strawberry Cheese Cake: Tasted like it had been sitting in the fridge way too long. Mushy strawberries. Thick consistency.- Grandma\\'s Bread Pudding: Dry and overwhelmed with cinnamon-soaked raisins.

Note the conclusion to your wife\\'s Facebook response. Thanks for helping prove my point on the racist/sexist claim. Now all of your current and potential customers can see it for themselves (picture of the Facebook response is attached). I KINDLY advised your wife to stop LOUDLY talking to me because nothing she was saying helped the situation (her treating us like crap from the moment I walked in), it looked bad for YOUR other customers - something I now see that you care nothing about as customer service is not a priority for you, and we had already decided to not get dessert and to just leave. She got upset by my wanting to end the conversation and said to you and other customers \"How she gonna tell me to stop talking in my own restaurant?\" On camera, she admitted that my saying that embarrassed her as if I was not embarrassed that she we yelling at us in front of everyone.

She greeted me with a menu and asked me to order immediately, I asked for 2 minutes and she rudely \\xa0replied, \"It\\'s going to be much longer than 2 minutes\" and walked away. When she returned, I asked for a wine recommendation and she brushed me off and annoyingly said \"all of them are good because I picked them and put them on the menu.\" \\xa0By the way, we NEVER lied. You have me confused with your seemingly racist wife (marrying black does not mean she\\'s incapable of racism and your being black does not mean you cannot harbor hate for your own people) who lied on camera by saying we told her to \"shut up\" then walked that lie back after we objected. You admitted ON CAMERA that you did not hear what she said to us throughout the evening. \\xa0I understand your desire to defend her but YOUR WIFE\\'S ATTITUDE WILL BE YOUR DOWNFALL. Get a different server, quick! Even if this unfortunate exchange at the end of our meal had not occurred, I would have never returned or recommended Belle to anyone because of the way she treated us throughout the night. She even cut you off when you were trying to talk with us and told you to tell us to leave! And what did you do, you stopped mid-sentence and said, \"leave.\" I\\'m sure there are plenty of other customers who have visited your establishment and were likewise turned off by her nastiest but left in silence (to never return) like we almost did.

For dinner, my girlfriend and I shared the bucatini with short rib ragu and the red snapper. The pasta was perfectly al dente and seasoned very nicely. My only recommendation is that there could have been more short rib in the dish. Our second dish, the red snapper, was also very good, and I appreciated the delicious parsnip and dill garnish that complemented, but did not overpower, the fish.

I came here for a birthday party and the whole thing lasted about 4 hours or so.We had an open bar, buffet and a DJ, but keep in mind I'm pretty sure you can be creative and customize your party theme as desired.I'm a sucker for their pasta, fried chicken, chicken Parmesan and steamed vegetables. The staff treated us with the utmost respect and attended to all of our needs.Honestly I'd like to visit again and hang out by the bar and take advantage of their Irish breakfast.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 1': '2 strikes and you\\'re out.... I absolutely hate writing negative reviews but this is the second time my boyfriend and I had a negative experience at Eileen\\'s/The Heritage. The first visit, we sat outside for dinner on a Tuesday night. We sat on \"The Heritage\" side if that makes a difference. The waitress took our order.... we asked for a medium rare burger and a fajita salad. We got a very well done burger, and the fajita salad was literally fajitas and a pile of lettuce.... the chicken was extremely over cooked and I barely ate it. Waitress barely checked on us. The second visit was a Friday morning (today!), and we sat outside again but on the Eileen\\'s side. We had the SAME waitress. We ordered iced coffees, pancake deluxe and Belgian waffle deluxe ( comes with sides of eggs and meat). Iced coffees came out, she brought milk but no sugar. Food came out with a different waitress and didn\\'t bring any of the sides we asked for- eggs, meat, fruit for my boyfriend and eggs for myself. The bacon I got was cold like it had been sitting. We finally got the rest of our food- and had to ask 3 times for the side of bananas which we never got. At this point we are not sure if it\\'s the kitchen staff or waitress being incompetent since every single order we had came out wrong the first time. After we ate we waited about 15 minutes waiting for someone to check on us and nothing - my boyfriend went inside and paid and said it was busy. We are very understanding BUT you have customers outside who are being ignored. We won\\'t be returning. The (correct) food once we got it was very good, but the service needs work!',\n",

The owner wasted no time in saying that he will not be sending anyone with the remainder of the food because they were too, \"busy\" over the phone and proceeded to put the phone down and leave me waiting for his return. When he did, he just said hello and hung up. I called again and he told me that there\\'s nothing he can do, where I let him know that if that\\'s the case, then he can have his food back and I can get my money back. He nonchalantly said, \"I\\'ll be here\" and hung up the phone.I realized my only option forward was to settle for whatever I was given in the delivery, although I had already paid for the entire order, or go in person and handle this matter.I went to the restaurant where the older gentleman who takes the orders told me he wasn\\'t going to give me any money back because he \"would have to put the food in the fridge and sell it again to make money from it\"I ran out of patience at that point and demanded my money back and he can have the food. He proceeded to call the police department in an attempt to maybe dissuade me from pursuing my money back.The police ended up mediating the situation by asking the older gentleman with the glasses to return my money, since I was offering the food right back to him (mind you, I ordered a delivery, and had to make my way to the restaurant with the food for this to happen)It was terrible and disgusting to see the business owner handling things like that. Even the police officer remarked that he\\'s going to lose a lot of business because of this. It\\'s clear that this restaurant is not the place to order from again from me, and I DO NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE order from there!! Order from any of the other good diners around the area!

Adding another waiter would help.3. Drinks - They're strict with Happy Hour drinks. I was brought my second drink 5 minutes before Happy Hour ended (after waiting 10 minutes to get the waiter's attention) and wanted to order another but was denied, even when I chugged the drink I just received in the front of the waiter. The drinks are good though, that I can't complain about. They're the third best Mexican cocktails in the neighborhood behind Refried Beans and Guadalupe.4.

They don't serve free chips and salsa like most Mexican restaurants do. You have to buy it for like $5.

Generally, when you order them you have to wait a while as they go fry them. I recently made a purchase of 8 samosas. I got home and started eating one but the potatoes tasted spoiled. I had my sister try one and she said her samosa was also spoiled. Since I don\\'t live in the same neighborhood as the restaurant, I called them and said, I was just at your store and you sold me samosas with spoiled potatoes, I\\'d like a replacement batch (I didn\\'t even ask for a refund because I knew they would refuse that). After 5 minutes of talking with the guy who at first didn\\'t get what I was saying (no I didn\\'t order anything from Grubhub, no I don\\'t want to order anything now, I was just there and had ordered in person), he said, okay you can bring it back. When I return with the samosas, the one I had spoken with now says, \"I talked with the owner who says we cannot do anything, once it leaves the store we cannot replace the food.\" I said, \"You sold me spoiled samosas, you can see and smell when potatoes are spoiling yet sold them anyway.\" He says, \"They\\'re not spoiled, as you remember, they made them fresh.\" I said, \"You may have fried the samosa dough but the potato filling itself was spoiled.\" They refuse to provide any compensation. I wasn\\'t even asking for a refund but they\\'re basically keeping the almost $10 I paid for food and not do anything?! It is worst to lose a customer and potential customers than to make a new set of samosas. I flung the bag of samosas on the counter and left.Afterwards, I realized I should have spoken with the owner directly. I called and spoke with him saying how wrong it was for them to take my money and not even replace the samosas I brought back after they originally told me I could replace them. He says, come back at 5pm and they will make a new batch because he said he wouldn\\'t be there for a few hours. At 5pm, I call again and speak with the owner and remind him that he said a new batch would be made if I come by. He now says, \"uhhhhh, I don\\'t know I have to speak with my son, blah blah blah.\" Basically, saying, they have no plans whatsoever of replacing them. Horrendous customer service.

The jerk chicken was well-flavored and the plantains were cooked incredibly well. I was impressed though with their Roti and their ox tails. I don't often eat ox tails because it's hard to find a restaurant that knows how to cook them, but I found a place that made them taste amazing. The only downside I can find is that I came on a weekday when they were supposed to be open at 11 am. I'm not sure when it opened but I waited for about 10 minutes and no one ever came.

Mushy crab cakes, 3 dried out, over salted pork chops, disappointing fried chicken, grainy mac 'n cheese, super salty but otherwise nice collard greens.

I could not run out fast enough. So let\\'s rewind and I\\'ll explain how I ended up here. My parents were visiting and we were actually on our way to another restaurant when my dad who was on his phone googling happened up SpaHa Soul and suggested we try it because it had great reviews. I was hungry so I said sure. Mistake #1. We walk in and its empty. Just the Chef/owner and waitress, Ebony. My dad says so I hear this is the best Soul food in Harlem to which the chef laughs and says we\\'ll see. We probably should have just walked out then. Mistake #2. We sit down and order food (it\\'s written on a blackboard no actual physical menu). Ebony tells us the food will take about 20 minutes. \\xa0We also try to order something besides water (ie soda, juice) and were told they don\\'t have that but we can go to the bodega and bring soda back. We probably should have walked out then. Mistake #3. So I go and get sodas and bring them back. Appetizers are still no where in sight 30 min in. We ask Ebony and she says they\\'ll be out soon. We twiddle our thumbs for 30 more minutes and ask her again she says it will be out in 10 min. 10 minutes pass and nothing. We also watched Ebony walk in and out of the restaurant each time coming back with a grocery bag to deliver to the chef presumably for ingredients he needed for the meals. We probably should have walked out then. Mistake #4. Finally 2 appetizers come out. Something called \"summer rolls\" and 2 tostones. Honestly guys, I tasted the summer roll and immediately spit it out. It was watermelon wrapped in mint and lettuce all within wonton wraps. The tostones were equally as bad. So now we\\'re 1.5 hours into this bad decision having just been served unappetizing appetizers still awaiting the main course. We probably should have walked out then. Mistake #5. At this point I\\'ve gotten up and went outside to get some fresh air. My mom was pacing the empty restaurant. My dad was on his cellphone and my sister was taking a nap. Finally, over 2 hours from when we placed our order the food came out. All I could do is stare at it. I could not believe I had waited 2 hours for what had been placed in front of me. The ONLY good thing I ate was the fried tilapia. Mac and cheese was dry and I\\'d prefer Kraft macaroni mac n cheese to that. The chicken was still bloody. The collard greens, rice and yams were pretty mediocre.Needless to say, I will NEVER return to this place and I am baffled as to how he stays in business. This was the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life. Please learn from my mistakes and go elsewhere.'},\n",

Lukewarm. Kids Mac and cheese. Bland. Both adults got endless shrimp. They should\\'ve named it wait endlessly for shrimp. Had to flag down our server to get the next set of shrimp after first order and then wait another 20 min for it to come. The shrimp Alfredo was dry as all hell and the server tried to say it would be extra for more sauce. Like how?!?!Then, the nerve to get an order of shrimp scampi and 2 of the shrimp were still practically completely raw. Lucky for them my sister found a manager before I could take a picture. But even he said yes it was clear they were raw. But no comps to meal, adjustments, free item, nada. And that\\'s on top of having to wait another 15 min for food.

After we reminded her about the birthday girl desert for the 5 th time she goes oh I forgot I thought u wanted to give your desert to her which by this point we are done with putting up with such horrible service we canceled the order of the extra desert and told her give her ours instead she ask the other staffs help her sing happy which they clearly where not in the mood to do anything with her and refused to help her out, my mother law was very sad my husband blew up and told her just give us the check she tried to changed her tip to 40% and my husband was not having it for someone this unprofessional fighting with other staffs on the floor the.

We started ordering drinks and as soon as she went to take our orders she spoke in Spanish which wasn\\'t a problem because in most places in the Bronx waitresses will speak to me in Spanish but usually just see what we are pointing to. My boyfriend ordered his drink and said out loud bulldog and pointed to it and I the same. The drinks came and she only gave me a bulldog and him a reg margarita. So we did not want to make a big deal we switched and thats when he noticed a rather large crack on the glass we made her aware of it and she asked \" do you want me to replace it \" . YES WE DO. The glass looked like if you held it to long it would shatter in your hand. then proceeded to order food and my boyfriend are tacos 3 steak and 3 chorizos and she looked him in his eyes and acknowledge him. and took my order. We get our food it was really good. But his chorizos tacos never came out. then when we told her she looked back at her paper like you only said 3 and I only wrote that. And I\\'m like no we told you. Finally she put the order in, around 10 mins later it came and there was a hair in the tacos. We immediately were turned off we returned them to management and all the manager kept saying was he can make new ones. I also asked another waitress for a napkin and she had no idea what I was saying until I pointed to one. The only person who could understand English was the manager And we also let him know about the broken glass. We ended up paying the bill and leaving. Only reason they got two stars was cause for a $9 margarita it was pretty good on the alcohol part.

My husband had to bring it to the kitchen staff because the waitress disappeared or not stop by. I usually would just remove the ingredients with a fork however the Sopes had melted cheese and it was not easy for me to remove it since it was stuck to the cheese. The waitress was not attentive nor refilled our waters. She had 3 tables to wait in total but would not come to check if things were ok. Service could have been better considering that it was noon and they were not busy and had other waitresses working. Besides that the food was good.

Even my favorite Greek place up the hill (Greek Express) uses premade cones - which in their case are excellent - but the T&S meat is special.The pork is melt in your mouth tender and deliciously seasoned. The chicken is just as good.The rest of the platter ingredients were also excellent - fries, pita, and a really great Greek Salad with lots of vegetables and what tastes to me like REAL feta.Their tsatsiki sauce and the Greek salad dressing were also great.The deserts are really special here - all homemade and first rate. \\xa0The melomakarona cookies and bourghatsa (sp?) are new to me but so good! Baklava also excellent.Establishment and food all clean and fresh.And best of all - the people who own this place are great! Really friendly and helpful. Hope they have great success.All in all a great find. Sorry I waited so long to try it but will be back very soon. Don't miss out on this place - it's sooooo good!\",\n",

Please ignore them, as these people are actively keeping you and others from experiencing authentic tasting Korean dishes. 3 star review for an off day? Fine. 1 star? Absolutely ridiculous, offensive and damaging to a business the rest of us here in Washington Heights truly appreciate.

Seriously - the only place you will find this chicken is IN Korea or made by an actual Korean person.Back to the food: Mandu is pretty authentic as well (mandu are Korean dumplings), Ramen is great but I don\\'t really eat ramen that much so I can\\'t really compare it to other places. My next favorite thing (after the chicken box) is the spicy pork bowl - which is very close to how my actual Korean grandmother prepares this dish.

I didn't realize that it came with cole slaw and french fries until after I ordered, and thought that was weird, but still looked forward to it. However, for $10.50, I got a bowl of kbbq pork that was mixed with... stale crinkle-cut french fries (like the frozen ones you bake)? And then the cole slaw was pretty wet so the vinegary, mayonnaise-y juices seeped into everything else and made the rice and meat an unwelcome acidic. The cole slaw was also straight up American tasting cole slaw, not like a pickled cabbage, or anything spicy. And unfortunately, the meat itself was also too burnt so every bite had that smokey, overcooked char taste. All in all, I was sort of confused by the meal. The closest thing to it would probably be one of those chicken/beef teriyaki platters you might get in a mall food court. Maybe the other bowls are better and I might come back to try one some time in the later future.\",\n",

The chicharron de pollo pieces were grotesquely HUGE Chicken breast (dark meat) pieces, with thick skin on every piece, and very slimy on the inside. I could not eat it, and was at the brink of throwing up! The chicken quality was very poor and low grade; EXTREMELY questionable. The fried sweet plantains were LOADED with so much grease, I could wring them out and have enough oil to refry them. Apparently, I could not eat those either! I wasted $10.00 on a nonedible meal, after not only walking to the store (over 15 minutes), but also walking to an ATM (No cash!). El Pabellon De Oro should be ASHAMED of themselves. Also, the menu is in desperate need of review and revision there are NO HEALTHY OPTIONS available. I did not want to order rice (because not everyone eats rice, or pork fried rice!), however I was told that I could not substitute the fried rice, French fries, or plantains ((everything is fried)) with broccoli or a different steamed vegetable :(. I was told that I had to choose one of those options, and if I wanted broccoli or another steamed vegetable (healthier option), I would have to order it SEPERATELY which comes with rice which is included in the price ($6.75). So, in order to eat lunch (which should be affordable) I have to order extra things that I do not want, or need AND I would have to pay EXTRA and have EXTRA food that I do not want. To end this review, I will not be visiting this establishment EVER again and do not recommend if you remotely care about your health. They, like many other establishments in the Bronx are the very reason for many of the health issues that many Bronxites are struggling with, due to lack of healthy food options, and healthier alternatives.

(2:35-5:00) sometimes disrespectful students (from lehman) come in and do whatever they want. without ordering. they used to steal drinks as well. (which is why the keep the fridge behind the counter now) before the manager moved, he was always there everyday and was able to keep those kids out. the new workers are very shy to kick them out sometimes, they do eventually. the place used to be cleaner and better decorated, but it's not the owners fault, just the area it's in. the food is absolutely delicious, service is great. prices are pretty cheap (specially the $5 deals that include 2 slices and a can for $5, wings and a can for $5, mozzarella sticks and a can for $5, good portions too) unless you're uncomfortable with dealing with obnoxious high school students, go there as much as you can !! final note: Remember, the place it's in and the type of kids that go there are the only things that make this place a little uncomfortable to eat at. don't let it stop you from eating from here though :)\",\n",

It was spicy and flavorful. I've tried a lot of jerk chicken recipes that aren't as spicy as I like, many are too sweet for me. But carifesta probably has the best jerk chicken I've ever tried. My mom loved the house fried rice too, she said it's completely different than the fried rice you get at your local Chinese spots. Only thing I wasn't a fan of though was the roast duck.

Upon arriving and after being seated, you receive some warm garlic bread. It was toasty yet fluffy on the inside, so I really liked that touch. The menu was average length on the shorter side, which I personally prefer because long menus overwhelm me. For our appetizer, my parents and I ordered the stuffed plantains with shrimp. It was very delicious but lacked salt. As for our entree, my mom had the churrasco, my dad had the sirloin and I opted for the filet mignon. We all ordered it medium well and had mashed potatoes on the side. Each steak entree comes with a free side and side salad. Ordering an extra side is an addition $5. My mom ordered rice and beans on the side that was average, nothing brag worthy. We all ended up loving our food! I personally liked my filet mignon the best, but everyone's food was delicious regardless. The quality of the meat was superb and the sides were equally amazing. The only thing I had a problem with regarding my food though was that it was too small. The size of the filet mignon compared to the rest of the steaks was disproportionately smaller.

It\\'s still a hotspot and after a couple of decades, that area, paved the way for a few decent restaurants- one of them being Willie\\'s Steak House. Under the L in Parkchester (Westchester & Thieriot Aves.- to be exact), still remains (a) the place to be seen, (b) see people you may haven\\'t seen and (c) run into people that you may have gone to High School or hung out with eons ago. For Parkchester standards, Willie\\'s is \"fancy\". The Man and I had an errand in the area and felt like having some Latin Caribbean food. Willie\\'s was very quiet for a Thursday, but Salsa music was playing and fortunately, kicked up the mood. Our server was pleasant and brought out the menus only to notice Seafood options, outweighed the Steak- and worked to my advantage- but isn\\'t this a Steakhouse? Mr. Man kind of questioned that, as there were all but 5 \"Steak\" dishes. He knew the food would be hearty and because this is a Puerto Rican restaurant, Mr. Man wanted to play it safe and ordered the Pork Chops instead- which he raved.My Camarones Enchilados (Deviled Shrimp), had the right amount of seasonings and my Tostones, were freshly fried. Full Bar but no extended cocktail menu- except for Red or White Sangria and Wine.Even though on the night we decided to visit there wasn\\'t a live Latin Jazz band, in the end, it was all about the food- which didn\\'t disappoint.',\n",

Second warning- The floors were sticky from the entrance to the table they sat us in (about midway into the restaurant). Even the menus were sticking together. We wondered it must have been a very busy day. But on a Monday afternoon, how busy can it be?? We decided to order anyway.Straw that broke the camels...... While waiting for our order, we noticed that the booth area we were in was not clean at all. Crumbs in seating crevices that were obviously there for a very long time. Food arrived so we decided to make the best of it..... Until.... a roach crawled on the back support of the booth seat, RIGHT NEAR TO MY WIFE... That \"A\" rating must be counterfeit, because their is NO WAY this restaurant is an \"A\" rated place. We should have made an about-face after the second warning.Btw, we informed the waiter of what we saw, a few mins later the roach made a second appearance, which the waiter saw for himself. However, instead of immediately offering to dismissing the bill or even at least speak with his manager about dismissing the bill, he proceeded to give us the check for our meal. Then mentioned that the exterminator was just there the day before which probably why we are seeing the roach, \"they just be getting air and are coming from the basement.\" SMH!!!!',\n",

I found this place via Yelp and reached out to the owner Paul. We were able to rent out the entire place (after they closed for dinner). We had an open bar package that the owner Paul offered us and we were able to alter and negotiate exactly what we wanted in the package. It was super affordable and in everyone's budget which was great. The ambiance in there was perfect, comfortable and classy. Paul allowed us to do decor and a photo booth wall which was a hit. The bartenders were on point and friendly, the music was great ( we got to plug in our device but he also had a set playlist). They also kept the kitchen open and my guest were able to order tapas for the majority of the night. We danced the night away and made the best memories. I really enjoyed it and my guest did too!!Thank you Paul!\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 1': \"First time I went here, it was drinks and appetizers so it wasn't bad. Actually it was nice. But this review is not about that time.Im writing about the second time I came here. I came here for brunch and brought some friends from out of town. Such a mistake. Do not order the chicken and waffles. There was no seasoning on the BAKED chicken that came on the side of the waffles. Seriously no salt, no pepper pepper. Also just legs? (Odd). For a Afro/Latin inspired/owned spot this was disappointing. Especially considering that the notion of chicken and waffles is said to be a southern concoction and souther soul food is renowned for it's Cajun and robust flavor profiles. The other food was meh. Withstanding that embarrassing dish, we were further let down when we ordered the bottomless mimosas. At $22 per person, I expect to get my money's worth. So imagine my surprise and annoyance when I found that the pours of each mimosa was inconsistent. When I said something to the server she laughingly remarked that she had watered some down because she thought we'd had enough. Excuse me? How dare you! Not only were we not drunk, rowdy or rude but we were the only people there. The only other customers were checking out. We'd only had about 4 mimosas and I'm almost certain 2 of which were only juice. Is it a crime to laugh and drink with friends over brunch? If so I understand cutting people off. But it's not and I paid for those drinks. Who do you think you are? That's never happened to me before in NY or anywhere. PEQUE and the presumptuous server Robin won't be getting my cash anytime soon.\",\n",

There's nothing Spanish about this place other than the music. The small plates were a disaster. It tasted like they prepared all of the food on Sunday and it was Friday when we ordered. The octopus was embarrassingly small and SUPER salty. The salmon croquettes weren't any better. It was DRY and uber lemony. I can't believe I was so excited to try this place. I feel duped. Mislead. Bamboozled. The second star is for my man Duke Ellington being featured on one of the plates. Won't be back.\",\n",

It also effects their customer service and what foods you are likely to get (soup with little to no meat, mostly fat pieces of beef, more bones, missing sides that come with meals, etc.). The prices are also inconsistent for basics. A small white rice sometimes fluctuates between $3-$4. \\xa0Pick a price and stick to it. Some of the servers are prejudice, and this also results in getting subpar food. To be sure of this a few co-workers and I had sent in Hispanic co-workers to get us food it and what they come back with is better soups, meatier specials with all the sides that go with it. \\xa0It's sad, I want to give them my business instead of the fast food restaurants that litter the area, but with service like that, it keeps me away.Also, avoid their oatmeal.

Me and my boyfriend Carlos headed out to this culinary destination, after my immunotherapy infusion session ended after 4:30 pm. I\\'ve been already craving Peruvian food for several days, especially for ceviche and yuca frita. As the early evening progressed and it got increasingly colder, I was still hesitant to go that far... It was cold and I was leaning towards a soup. Anyway, long story short, we headed out to Los Nisperos. As soon as we arrived, people were standing before the food counter, waiting for takeout. As soon as we took our coats off, and we sat, we were greeted by a polite waitress. Although the restaurant is small, it was nicely decorated with pictures frames up on their walls, which gave it a much more cozy, homey feel. We had a can of ginger ale each. There was a small plate of Peruvian toasted corn kernels. I had the tiradito, which is a Peruvian-style chicken rice soup. It was a very delicious dish; arrived piping hot at the table, with a lime wedge. Carlos had 1/4 rotisserie chicken, rice, beans. We shared the shrimp ceviche, with a side order of yuca frita and also an order of fried squid. This establishment is very down to basics; it\\'s a hole-in-the-wall joint that truly delivers a flavorful punch. The rotisserie chicken was delicious, very juicy. We also enjoyed the fried calamari. It came with a dipping sauce. I believe, by the taste, that it was ginger-based, with a slight touch of honey. I must say, that the highlight of our dinner, was the shrimp ceviche. They were plump, perfectly marinated in its citrus juice. It also came in a crispy bed of lettuce, and the classic, red pickled onions. The best part of this dish, was the citrus marinade or as they call it, leche de tigre, tiger\\'s milk...I really wished I had a spoon to drink all that flavorful leche de tigre! It was so good!!! Carlos looked at me like, \"wow, you really are hungry, don\\'t you?\" I wiped clean every single plate. I almost cried when the waitress took the plate with the tiger\\'s milk! The calamari platter also came with a bed of crispy lettuce. Next time, there will be room for desert! Overall, we were very satisfied. Excellent food, simple decor, and great service. I would never thought of such a great place to eat, in the South Bronx! The staff are very polite. The Spanish music is great, not loud at all. Their customer\\'s restroom is CLEAN AND SPOTLESS.

All solid food options, nothing that will blow you away but all good.2. Drinks - Have good happy hour specials. Haven't racked up high drinks bills due to this. 3. Atmosphere - Plenty of TVs here, so a great spot to watch the games or UFC fight. Spacious spot so I've never felt that I'm sitting on top of somebody. 4. The servers have always been nice, friendly, and attentive. Kudos to the afternoon staff the several times I've gone. 5. Restrooms are individual rooms so if you have to go #2, you'd have no problem doing so here and the restrooms have always been clean.\",\n",

After all they advertised UFC 241 all over their windows, but had pop music blasting through the fights, even up until the main card and their tv kept crashing and flickering on and off making it a pretty frustrating watching experience.

So I yelped it up and came up with this place. We got in right at 12 and the place was pretty empty (when I first took inside photos) but when we left at like 12:45 it was hopping! The menu is basic bar food classics done well. I got the fried chicken sandwich with regular fries. It was EXCELLENT. There was a jalapeño relish on the sandwich that really added to it. Chicken was fresh out of the frier and crispy. I'm not normally a big chicken/cheese person but I figured I'd get the sandwich as advertised, and the cheese worked on it, especially with the heat from the relish. Fries were homemade shoestring and were equally delicious! 10/10 would get again. Mom got the FW burger with onion rings. I got to sample some of the onion rings- worth the up charge if you're a fan of beer battered rings- we are! The burger vanished, and she said it was very tasty.

I am also a server and bartender so I felt so bad about this, our waiter (bigger guy with small pony tail) was reluctant and gave some attitude but eventually we switched to a different dish and it was delicious.Okay, so crisis averted, however when we paid... we only split between 3 people, something like $25, $17 and $17 in cash.

He likes to joke around and is full of interesting stories.We would definitely come back when in the Bronx. If we could give it more than 5 stars we would!

You can get to H.I.M Ital by hopping off 233rd on the Bronx River Pkwy then drive up from there. But I was already in the area so drove under the L which got me there quick. In a borough where Vegan is hard to find, H.I.M specializes in Grains (pasta and rice), meat substitutes (which I always pass up) and obviously- Vegetables. Looks are deceiving- noticed a small counter with a stool or two up front but seems more for takeout meals than anything else. Maybe because it was so early in the day, most of their hot foods weren't prepared yet- so decided on what was readily available- a bowl of 1/2 Kale & 1/2 Okra which was very nice. Both items were seasoned sensibly and was nice to change my palate a bit. Also noticed all their dry herbs and natural elixirs available. Sybil is so friendly and gave me info on most of the selection as well as detox beverages. In the end, price for my super healthy and hefty 2-Veggie plate plus a few ounces of detox dry Herbs, was just $11. I was all over the spirituality mindset H.I.M provides. If you're in need of a serious health reboot, go for their Caribbean Vegan food. And even if you're not Vegan and you just feel like breaking up the week with some meat free meals, this place celebrates everything Ital (Vegan). Let me just say, H.I.M is armed with a healthy supply of clean eating and nature-focused way of life...and I liked every bit of it. One Love!\",\n",

I've been here three times the bartenders are OK. I don't ever eat the food when I come but I did eat some wings the last time and they were OK. The hookah can be very harsh and burns out quickly if you seem like you don't know how a hookah should function then they may Scam you out of the first $30 so you can keep refilling it for $20. A hookah refill is $20 in an area like this; that is pretty pricey especially for the type of crowd that this place brings in. It's unfortunate because it's a really cute spot but it's a very small spot so when situations occur, fights really destroy the entire night and it shuts down. Yes I said grown people over 25 years old still coming outside to fight. I went last Saturday and as soon as we refilled two hookahs; not even 60 seconds afterwards an massive fight broke out (knocking over peoples drinks and hookahs) which caused the entire lounge to shut down.

We went during happy hour and tried to order some of the items on the happy hour menu, but a majority were not available. The group then went ahead and ordered the Imported Charcuterie board which was less than spectacular. The selection included \"salumi\" which were not good quality and resembled cold cuts from a supermarket. The prosciutto tasted old and the salami was oily and completely tasteless.When the entrees came out (over 45 minutes later) out of the 6 people at the table only one person actually enjoyed their food. She ordered the Pan Seared Chicken Breast and mentioned it was good. The rest of us.. not so much. I ordered the pop + pour salad with chicken and I while I get that salads are not meant to be the most delicious thing in the world, this was the blandest, saddest salad I\\'ve ever had in my life. The chicken was unseasoned and pan-fried which just did not pair well with bed of plain spinach and a couple of tomatoes and cucumbers. The dressing was so thick that it I couldn\\'t put it over the salad. A whole mess. The service was also very confusing. The restaurant was pretty much empty and the food took ages to come out. The servers also forgot one person at the table\\'s food completely and would come around and refill some people\\'s water but not others which was just odd.

Then, we ordered a beef bibimbap and the shrimp dumplings lunch specials. As she and the waiter were bringing out our dishes, the owner asked us whether we were planning on sharing (which we were), and she brought out new dishes for us to use.The bibimbap came as a large bowl of beef with vegetables (bean sprouts, mushrooms, sliced carrots, some sort of spiralized vegetable, beef, fresh cucumbers, cucumber salad, and spinach) and a sunny-side-up egg with gochujang and a bowl of rice for each of us on the side. The dumplings were served with potatoes and a salad and came with soy sauce, and then furthermore, we received cucumber salad, kimchi, pickled cabbage. It was a really nice spread of refreshing food that was tasty but not too heavy--perfect for a hot day! (Next time, I might get the shrimp dumplings steamed rather than fried because the filling is flavorful enough that they probably don't need an oil-fried exterior to be delicious.) The portions were so generous that we wound up taking a bunch of food home, and our waiter packaged everything up separately and neatly for us.We actually came to Hometown Dumpling to scope it out as a potential place to get food to bring to my grandparents, and it definitely passed the test.

As I was asking her something, she spoke over me and then hung up. I called back and asked why did she hang up. She said she told me ok no problem and hung up. I asked why when I was in the middle of a sentence and she truly did not say that. At this point she was speaking over me as I was asking her about my order. And then she said ok then talk. So as I am speaking and asking her questions she refused to speak. I asked numerous times why isn't she responding and she refused to speak and I hung up. I went down to the store and brought the wrong food back, asked for my money back and asked to get the food comped. After talking it out she agreed and said the delivery guy just left. At first we were communicating well and I think she did this because there were customers in the store. Essentially she said that the delivery guy made the mistake of sending the wrong order and that she said goodbye on the phone. I told her it was poor customer service. So she gives me only 20 of the 26 bucks (I paid extra when I asked for my replacement because she alleged it cost more). I argued it was incorrect but the language barrier was an issue so I gave up and took the 20 and waited for the delivery guy for my food. He comes gives me the food and she asked for it I give it to her and she said I had to pay for it. I told her why would she agree to comp the food and the refund is she was going to charge me. She was sooo rude and I understand the language barrier can cause miscommunication but why renege on the agreement. I didn't know what to do.

Before I bite into this subject I just want to say our server \"Eleni\" was very sweet and appeasing and did the right thing at the end, more on that later. The hot open faced turkeySandwich was good with fresh roasted, thinly sliced turkey with a good gravy on the side. The home made mashed potatoes were delicious as well. Unfortunately, my entree was a disaster! I asked for steak quesadillas with the sour cream and salsa on the side. It arrived plated with a full onion slice and tomato slice on the side on a bed of lettuce (not quite sure what they were for. Garnish?) \\xa0Now I stated my concerns to our server of getting my steak medium and not over done but alas the steak was like fatty liver! \\xa0Then orangey salsa also was sub par, thin and bland.

       "  'Negative Review 1': 'Cute little coffee shop on pleasant avenue! Warning: Cash only! I ordered a grilled cheese with American cheese and a small vanilla chai. The grilled cheese was scrumptious but, my drink was lukewarm.Nonetheless, I would stop by again.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': 'Food is on point, good place for an intimate breakfast/brunch.If you plan on sitting, just get there before or after the school rush!',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': 'Wouldve been 5 stars since i love the atmosphere but i cant enjoy food with hair in it. Just purchased a sandwhich for myself and daughter, only to find a long thick black strand of hair mixed in my eggs. Hair nets are a must for long hair in any food establishment. 2 stars for the atmosphere.'}]"
