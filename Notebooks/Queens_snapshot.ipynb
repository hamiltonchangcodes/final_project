       "[{'restaurant': 'Haidilao Hotpot',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 1': 'I had my first Haidilao experience 18 years ago, to me this remains best hotpot place in the world since then. Even with more and more hotpot brands popping up in China nowadays, I still think Haidilao is THE BEST among them all - the food, the service, the amenities, etc. I was so excited to learn that Haidilao is coming to NYC eventually. My BF made the reservation a month ago and we finally gets to try it today. It is really good, from every aspect.We ordered the soup base with four different flavors, tomato and spicy oil soup base are my all time favorite. The hotpot tastes pretty much like what I had back in China, maybe the tomato soup base is slightly more diluted than what I had in China, but I\\'m glad they did not \"tailor the flavor\" to accompany the US market, which is what happened to their first LA restaurant - yes I went to their first LA restaurant too when it opened and was very disappointed at what they did to make Haidilao \"Americanized\".Let\\'s talk about dishes. I think the menu in NYC is smaller than the one in China, there are several signature dishes I always get before that are not offered here. Anyway, crispy pork, wagyu beef, and their house special tofu are my favorites. The crispy pork was not oily at all and boiled well in the soup. Wagyu beef - I know it\\'s a pretty hefty price tag - but get it if you can!!! It\\'s beautifully marbled, so soft and tender with just 20 seconds in a boiling soup base. The house special tofu was especially good with their special tofu sauce. The mushroom flavored tofu sauce was very earthy and flavorful, and compliments the simplicity of the tofu, even my bf who doesn\\'t really care about tofu thinks it is very tasty. Everything else is fresh and well prepared. A lot of people get to know Haidilao because of their unbelievably attentive service, the NYC restaurant kept it very well. We were seated fairly fast when we get here, and our waitress Lily did a great job on getting everything we needed for us even though she was busy with several other tables. The restaurant was crazily full and busy for a Sunday dinner, the waiting area was packed from the time we walked in (6:30 pm) till we leave (8:00 pm). There are so many interesting things to try during the wait - the manicure, the massage chairs, free snacks and drinks... They are really trying to make the wait not so boring lol.I always think restroom is a good indicator to see if a restaurant is detail oriented and puts in real thoughts to make their customer experience better. Haidilao nailed it. Ladies, you will find whatever you can think of in Haidilao\\'s restroom - even a Dyson hairdryer and Dior perfume!!! This is literally the nicest and the most thoughtful restroom I\\'ve ever seen in NYC. I walked out of this place with a happy belly. The ice cream offered at the end of meal was really good! And we took the food we didn\\'t finish and the leftover tomato soup base home, which is pretty interesting because I don\\'t know any other hotpot places that allow you to take home your soup base... Our meal ends up being around $150 for three people, which I think is pretty standard for a nice a la carte hotpot place. I would highly recommend this place for anyone who wants to get authentic hotpot experience.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"The best hotpot I have ever been to. Hands down. The staff couldn't be more accommodating and helpful. Catherine, who appears to be the floor manager here was very kind and informative on what was on the menu. Ben, our server also provided exemplary service. Plates were snatched up as soon as they were empty. The service was truly stellar. I'm not royalty, but I felt like it dining here.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I totally understand why people love this place! The service and amenities are excellent! My friend and I went on a Thursdays evening at around 6pm and the wait was not that bad and we didn't have a reservation, but that might be because it was raining. We waited only about 15-20 minutes. The waiting room was packed as we were leaving though. The entrance is in the back, through the Flushing Commons square. Once you arrive, there are staff that put you on the waiting list and give you a number. There are some drinks and fruit by the entrance as well as seats for waiting. The main waiting room is upstairs where there are more seats, snacks, drinks, games, a kids play area, two massage chairs, and the hand message and glasses/jewelry cleaning service. There are also charging banks and screen protector changing, although I didn't see where that was being done. All of this is free! You do have to sign up for the hand massage though on the ipad by the massaging station. They'll give you a print out of your number and call you when it is your turn. The person manning that station at the time only spoke Mandarin though. When your table is ready, your number will be called over the loud speakers and you are taken to your table.The table seating is very modern and booth-like. There are drawers under the seats where extra bowls and utensils are stored. Food is ordered through a tablet. Our server was Andrew and he was great. He explained the menu to us, brough over some condiments for our soup, and even diluted our beef mala broth with tomato broth when we found it too spicy for us! Food arrived quickly. We ordered the four different broths, seafood, filtered beef mala (without peppercorns), mushroom, and tomato. The beef mala broth was very spicy even when we asked for less spicy! Be careful with the heat! The mushroom was very mild and kind of bland. Our favorites were the seafood and surprisingly the tomato. There are two sauce stations with a variety of sauces and well as recipes to make a dipping sauce if you have no idea what to mix together. In addition to the sauces, there are free fruits, some cold appetizers (spicy cucumber, vermicelli, tripe), and some desserts (grass jelly, sweet congee). I believe it varies. We ordered way too much food and was too full to try the desserts offered at the sauce stations. I recommend checking out the sauce station to see what they have before ordering. Ordering combos is the way to go. I would avoid ordering the baby octopus since it gets tough if you leave it in the broths too long. I also didn't like the wheat noodles. They start to clump if cooked too long and was very heavy tasting. At certain times, there is a mask changing show. The dancing noodle also comes with a mini performance as the noodles are being stretched and thrown. Unfortunately, we were too stuffed to try these noodles, but we saw the performance from the nearby tables that ordered them. It was cute and a bit cheesy. At the end of the meal, our server Andrew got us ice cream cones which were delicious and very creamy. Much better than I expected!Make sure you check out the restroom before you leave! It is fully stocked in there with baby wipes, combs, toothbrushes, toothpaste, and even a facial spray and perfume! The toilet seats were even heated which was so nice! If you missed out on the amenities in the waiting room, you can try them out after your meal. Excellent service, but I had yummier hot pot elsewhere. Since it is an a la cart hot pot dining experience, it can get expensive quickly. Don't order too much at once so you can enjoy the sauce station!\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': 'It was the WORST experience I had ever. \\xa0My friends and I had dinner at Haidilao, \\xa0it was Thursday, just couple days ago. We did reservations on yelp,so fast, they sat us,and the table just right next to the restroom. Yes, even you did make the reservation, and there still a lot of empty tables,not the rush hours, it was 4:00PM. After we ordered the soup base, my friend asking if we can \\xa0have another table instead, the waiter just like \"ok,fine\".  \\xa0When we eating, the waiter never comes back to see us, we were asking for change plates least 3 times,and we ordered the water in the beginning, he just totally forgot about it. We asked him again, he just like \"it\\'s ok, not the big deal \".  \\xa0Later after he brings the bill to us, even my friends still eating. And the next second( yes, seriously just one second) he asking us if we pay card or cash, we don\\'t even have time to look at the bill, we not finish our food, still bunch of food on the table, he just bring the machine needs us to pay right away. He told us the average tips is between 18%-20% at here, better to tip 20%. We tip 18%. I worked at the restaurant before, I do know that\\'s the normal percentage for tips. but the way how he asked us, push us and the \\xa0ATTITUDE WAS SO \\xa0RUDE \\xa0AND DISGUSTING . And the service was so TERRIBLE.  \\xa0We spent about $200, it\\'s \\xa0three of us. The food was ok. I mean for this price you can find many good hot pot places, not really worth.  \\xa0 Since I have the yelp account almost 6 years, I never written any of bad reviews, even I don\\'t really like the foods or other reasons. But the service I have to say IT WAS THE WORST I HAD EVER IN MY LIFE. \\xa0 DO NOT RECOMMEND this place.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Great full service hot pot. Expensive compared to other aspects but the service kills it compare to every other hot pot. Lots of freebies, but is included in the price.If you have kids, they have table side cribs. Noodles are done table side in a dance. I would bring big spenders next time during the day.It is not all you can eat so plan accordingly. I will also stay with the cheaper meat because expensive meat doesn't shine too much in hot pot.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'Lovely neighborhood restaurant with a late night kitchen. We will often show up close to midnight looking for dinner. The service has never faltered and the food has never disappointed in the past 3 years. We come in about 3 times a month. The staff are amazingly nice. We are often greeted with a \"hey guys!\" and a hand shake. The service is attentive and quick. The menu is simple, with lots of items to choose from: sandwiches, salads, burgers (yum!!), and nachos (my fav) just to name a few. I would describe the menu as wholesome, comfort food. The dishes are simple, without overly complex flavors and no fancy-shmancy sauces. BUT that does not mean the food isn\\'t fantastic. It is very good, quality food with flavors that stand out. Also, they have a great tap list from local breweries and quality glasses of wine for under $10. We will continue to come here for our late night dinners.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"September 2019 11/10! Thank you Jonathan and Geill? (sorry I misspelled your name) for this amazing meal! from ambiance to food, perfection! A restaurant with such good vibes are hard to come around and when it does, I have to keep telling people about it! The servers and customers there were so friendly in suggesting what's good in this tiny but cozy place in the hearty of Sunnyside, happy hours til 7pm. We had all the popular dishes like nachos, skirt steak lollipop, alcove burger with upgraded truffle fries, cuban sandwich, angus burger (when I actually meant to order alcove, either way, this is delicious as well), and the churros with mango sorbet. We also tried the margarita flight (included in HH!) with guava, passiofruit, pineapple and traditional flavors (shot glass sized), tamarind margarita, and blueberry beer! We all enjoyed our time there and I definitely would come back for more! Keep it up, The Alcove!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Our experience on Friday night was extraordinary! The 30 minute wait was more than worth it. We were seated in the middle of the restaurant, and looked around to see that the place was packed to the brim! All the other tables were taken along with all the seats at the bar. Usually in establishments where the owner is helping out it turns out to be a top notch place. Our waiter and our bartender were the owner\\'s brothers, and we could clearly feel the passion behind their amazing service.To eat, we started with the patacones. As an avid meat eater, I loved that they added topped them with pork. To eat, I ordered the Chimichurri Truffle Fries. It sounds like a weird combination but it was actually very delicious. We also got the steak lollipops which were very well seasoned and tender.The grilled chicken tacos were a hit too. They have an amazing local beer selection, and offer margarita flights. After a long day of work there\\'s nothing I wanted more than a margarita flight. The servings are small but definitely potent. I was also surprised to learn that it was my birthday that night. When I returned from the bathroom, the wait staff and the owner brought out warm churros and ice cream. They also belted out \"Happy Birthday\" in the best harmony I\\'ve ever heard. They were delicious and a great ending to our meal. The food was great and the hospitality was unforgettable. I can\\'t wait to return!',\n",

I was surprised that there was no line on a Saturday but thank God cause we were starving!!The ambiance is very rustic/casual and the menu is small which I like: quality over quantity.

I tried to keep this place a secret until it was my hunny's birthday. Earlier in the day I dropped off a cake from Martha's Country Bakery at Mojo so that I could surprise my hunny with it after we finished dining. I have to say that the Mojo staff were not only accommodating, but also understanding of me wanting his night to be perfect. I initially had a reservation at 7pm for two, but his mom and brother wanted to take him out also so I changed the reservation to 7:30pm for a party of four. We were seated upstairs where our waitress gave us ample amount of time to make our decision.We started off with apps and drinks which consisted of Moscato, Watermelon Frozé, and a La Amazonica. My hunny's La Amazonica was too strong for me. The Watermelon Frozé was bomb.com. I love frozen drinks. It tasted like a watermelon jolly rancher slushy. I definitely recommend trying it as it is one of their strongest frozen drinks. For our apps we ordered Tostones and Frituras Del Mar. I'm not sure how the tostones turned out but they were finished before I was able to take a picture. Our Frituras Del Mar app was on the smaller side and looked like a dish for one person, maybe a dish for two if you don't have much of an appetite. Certainly not a dish that can be easily served amongst four people. The Frituras Del Mar was okay but can be vastly improved if the dish was cooked a little longer. The batter was lightly fried which didn't provide the crunchiness I was longing for. I'm a huge fan of pickled onions but it didn't add much flavor to the dish, however it was aesthetically pleasing to the eye. The green sauce was amazing. I didn't care for the tartar sauce. Our entrees consisted of the Jumpin' Lomo, Churrasco, and Latino Fried Rice. My hunny and I both enjoyed our Churassco. We ordered our skirt steak medium which came out perfectly cooked. The garlic rice was really good. My only gripe is that the beans did not come out with our dish. I mentioned the missing beans to our waitress. She brought our beans out momentarily. His brother enjoyed his Jumpin' Lomo, but stated that the dish became salty towards the end of his meal. He also said that the portions could've been bigger -- I totally agree. His mom stated that the dish tasted rank and that the meat didn't taste as if it was cleaned properly. I'm not sure what their meals tasted like but the guys finished their meals. His mom and I ended up taking the rest of our meals home. Our waitress was kind enough to provide a sparkler for my hunny's birthday cake and even went as far as singing Happy Birthday to him with a few of her coworkers.I give Mojo a solid 3.5 stars.\",\n",

The ambiance is nice, and in the summer the doors are open so you feel like you're dining outside. They used to have a spicy margarita or some frozen spicy drink which was awesome but they got rid of it because many people did not like it.

The fish tacos were tasty and you can't go wrong with rice and beans. The service was really friendly and accommodating too.

By the time we got to the bottom layers they were sopping wet. Chicken tacos: bland. has potential but lacking an umph. The chicken was also lukewarm which is unfavorable. La cosecha tacos: meh. I was genuinely looking forward to eating these. But they were ultimately not impressive. Very bland, the shell was also not elastic enough to hold the taco and ended up ripping. Also served cold and lacking a little salt. We ended up putting the salsa and sour cream from the nacho tower on it to bring it some flavor. \\xa0Mexican chocolate cake: pretty decent. resembled a cinnamon covered soufflé with out a runny center. Clearly microwaved as some parts were ice cold and others burned your tongue. Service was decent as well. However took the waitress about 10 minutes to get to our table and take our drink orders.

I came for dinner on a Friday and it was popping with a long line of surprisingly well-dressed people. I don't really get the culinary appeal: hardshell tacos were kind of interesting but I didn't find to be that tasty, and the price-point is such that you are actually disappointed if you don't love the food. My two friends and I thought it was pretty 'Meh', but reviews suggest people love it. If you want something trendy for a date or to prove that the neighborhood is cool, it's a decent spot.

The waiter said that that they couldn't do that. I don't know if it's their policy, but he didn't even ask the manager or the chef. This is very upsetting, as I deliberated a long time to get everything that I wanted. I don't know if they're normally this inflexible, but the place was quite crowded for a Labor Day weekend. I'm happy to see the business is doing well. As I said before, the food is so good and every time I go, the place is pretty empty which worried me. Maybe the kitchen was extremely busy and not prepared for such a busy lunch hour on a normally would be dead weekend. The food came out extremely slow which is OK since I had some catching up to do with my friend but the inflexibility of the menu was disappointing.While the food was usually pretty close perfect, it wasn't this time. One of the eggs on my friend's lobster Benedict was completely overcooked while the other one was nice and soft. When I requested a replacement egg, it took almost 10 minutes to receive it. Since we weren't able to get the fried softshell crabs on the side, we ordered a third entrée from the dinner menu which was pan-fried softshell crabs with some sort of salsa. It was not good at all. The combination was strange and it just didn't complement the soft shell crab. We barely even touched it. The pan-fried crabs were not nearly as good as the deep-fried crabs which was not even an entree option on the menu nor were we given an option to pay extra for it on the side. Yes, we could've just ordered another breakfast entrée but that only came with one softshell crab and we each wanted one. Needless to say, I was disappointed and embarrassed because I was so excited to have her try this place.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Went to Dinerbar with friends for Sunday brunch. A completely terrible dining experience due to our incompetent and rude waiter. Bad enough to completely overshadow some solid breakfast food. Quality: It was not the food that was a problem at Dinerbar, it was the service. I think everyone in my party enjoyed their food, when they got it. The Pulled Pork Benedict was savory and the meat was extremely tender. While the Neapolitan French Toast Tower was perfect for a sweet tooth. However, the tasty food could not make up for the horrendous experience. Quantity: Good sized portions, especially the French Toast Tower.Value: $17 for the Pulled Pork Benedict. $15 for the Neapolitan French Toast Tower.Ambiance: Dinerbar is located in the Forest Hills area of Queens. They took the old school diner look and added some modern flair. The restaurant is spacious and full of light. They have a long bar area that does in fact serve drinks. And they have some televisions hanging up showing sports and highlights. The music is lively, helping add energy to Sunday brunch.Crowd: The restaurant was busy for Sunday brunch. It took about 5 minutes to get seated. However, the crowd was no excuse for the service.Service: Our waiter was absolutely terrible. He took our orders, but forgot to bring out our drinks. We had to grab someone else who then had to hunt down him down. When they found him he asked me what my order was. Apparently he put in the rest of the order, but not mine. So when the food came out it was not too surprisingly to see my food missing. Luckily, my friend was willing to share because it wasn't until 10 minutes after everyone else finished that my food finally showed up. There was no apology though, instead he hounded over our table when he saw me ask for the check. An extremely uncomfortable way to end a horrible brunch.Parking: A fair amount of street parking nearby.\",\n",

We topped our rolls with chili oil which made it taste even better. Each steamed rice roll was silky soft and scrumptious. Our favorite was the shrimp.

After the pasta came I said to my boyfriend it was good but not the best thing I had eaten there.Once the bill arrived we realized the small mediocre dish was priced at 100 dollars.. 100 dollars for one dish of pasta? That is something that should be told prior to ordering. As someone who has gone to expensive restaurants their entire life this turned my stomach.As an establishment it should be noted to express prices that are out of the ordinary for a tiny dish of pasta. When we asked for the check the waiter never brought it nor did he pick up the bill.. instead he sent the bus boy.. it was not busy at this time..It was clear he was avoiding the conversation Bc he knew that we would be upset..As a family establishment it should be an experience to treat customers as family.

The burger's meat was juicy with bbq sauce, but covered in a thick layer of American cheddar cheese; Nobody need that much bad cheese on anything.

Tucked away is this rustic Cuban restaurant serving up delicious food and a cool island vibe with its photos and memorabilia of Cuba on the walls. It is not an upscale place but it is warm and inviting with an atmosphere perfect for a cozy dinner with that special someone or family. I ordered the red sangria and jupina both equally delicious but who doesn't love sangria so I would opt for that next time I visit . We ordered the fried green plantains, rice and beans cooked with bacon, roasted pork and of course their famous Cuban sandwich with a side of drench fries. Let's start off with those rice and beans .... could I have a whole pot of those to go ? So delicious so flavorful .... I couldn't get enough of it and paired with the roasted pork covered in their garlic sauce it was bliss in every bite . The fried green bananas also amazing and super crunchy.their Cuban sandwich really is delicious I truly enjoyed the fact that there was a good bread to filling ratio and that the bread was nicely toasted and super crunchy. My only issue were the fries being a little too oily. Overall an amazing culinary experience and i will definitely be back for more of that rice and beans !\",\n",

He directed me to the bathroom after I answered. \\xa02. The workers refolded any unattended napkins. When I came back my napkin had been refolded and I noticed the same magic happen for the tables around me whenever someone got up and left their napkin behind.We had an 8:15 reservation on a Saturday night I would say that a reservation is absolutely \\xa0necessary as the restaurant was filled and everyone who came in around the same time that we did- had a reservation. We were seated immediately which speaks to the organization of the hostesses!The lighting is intimate which makes it ideal for couples. We noticed a lot of families as well.

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'This place has been on my radar for a while. I finally went with a friend during Summer Restaurant Week last month. The interior is elegant, classy, sophisticated and beautiful with larger than life windows, wood ceilings, along with green, yellow and white color scheme. The front area was charmingly decorated with a chalkboard sign spelling out \"Welcome\" in Italian and English, plants in vases, and a tree-like plant of green leaves and pink flowers. The bar area is a circular shape not too far from the front entrance. The dining area is a lovely sight to behold! Toward the back, there is a kitchen prep counter with meats hanging from above and beyond that is an outdoor patio area with a view of the Pepsi sign in Gantry State Park. For my appetizer, I decided on the lamb meatballs which consisted of pistachios and pecorino fondue. This was served on a cast iron grill on top of a wood board. There were 4 lamb meatballs sizzling in an abundant amount of pecorino cheese. The lamb was incredibly juicy, tender and full of flavor, while the cheese was perfectly melt in your mouth delicious. I also got to try the Burrata, made of mozzarella, sundried tomato, prosciutto, fig, and honey. \\xa0This was refreshing and the ingredients paired well together. I ordered the Branzino for the entree, which came with green beans, roasted potatoes, and almonds. The Branzino was a thin white sliver of fish in a sauce that I did not like. There was something about the taste of the fish itself that also didn\\'t agree with me. The waiter allowed me to select a different dish, which I appreciated. The waiter recommended the pesto goat cheese ravioli which did sound lovely, however, I went for the oven-roasted half chicken. The chicken came with peppers and onions, as well as 2 pieces of polenta fries. Per the menu, it was supposed to come with butternut squash and I expected more polenta fries, so I was slightly disappointed. I enjoyed the chicken though. The meat was succulent and dripping with flavorful and well-seasoned sauce. The vegetables were tasty and fresh, while the polenta fries were crispy and wonderful with the accompanying mayo-based sauce.As we continued our meal, my friend and I witnessed a couple of guests getting the tableside pasta service where a wheel of cheese was melted in front of their eyes and added to a pan of cooking pasta. I believe some versions included truffle. It was quite a sight to experience and that smell was truly aromatic! I had a tough time choosing a dessert but finally decided to try the Pannetone bread pudding with salted caramel, along with cookies and cream gelato. It was the right decision! There was salted caramel custard on the bottom with a satisfying size of bread and a nice scoop of gelato with a drizzle of caramel on top. The bread pudding was absolutely delectable... The right amount of outer crunch, inner moistness, thickness, and sweetness. Gelato was delightfully creamy and had the pure taste of cookies and cream. The caramel tied everything together beautifully. The service was top notch with informed recommendations by the waiter and always making sure we were satisfied. I would like to return to try the pasta!',\n",

When everyone arrived he asked us if we were ever there before (our first time) and then let us know that we would have to go outside if we needed to use our phones. This rule is by far Genius!

It was the first time for both of us, so the waiter explained how the ordering process goes, which is simply just putting a check mark next to the items you want. Lobster house also offers alcoholic beverages.My friend I decided on a variety of different flavored shrimp, mussels, crawfish, salmon, crab legs, ribs, calamari, broccoli & seafood lo main. Everything was good , hot, & seasoned well. For drinks we tried the \"Lychee Passion\" which was eh it\\'s not something I would order again. For pricing, I think it\\'s very moderately priced for what you get which is $40 per person for the unlimited seafood. The way they have the food portioned is good & the only thing we ordered a 2nd serving of was the crab legs, while still having plenty of other food still left. I do feel the drinks are few dollars overpriced. I would think it would be between $10-$12, but it\\'s gonna cost you $15 with limited options. Our server was very polite & attentive. We never had to look around for our sever because he checked in. So, why the three stars might you ask...it\\'s due to the \"service charge\". They specify on the menu the \"service charge\" is for the \"business\" & not gratuity. I have a really hard time believing that & when my bill is going to the business...now if the business is also taking that \"service charge\", that\\'s just greedy & unethical in my opinion. My next question would be how are you coming up with that % because it\\'s 12% they are charging as a \"service charge\". At the end of the night the waiter also reiterated to us how the \"service charge\" works & a tip isn\\'t mandatory, but would be appreciated. We did tip him, but I just don\\'t know about this \"service charge\" thing not going to the waiter, who I feel should be entitled to it.

For the main courses I had not one but two cooked perfectly Greek hamburgers (my wish come true - a place that gives you two patties, not just one :-). The others in my family had (per their feedback) delicious lamb chops, Branzini (Mediterranean sea bass) and Barbounia (red mullets). For dessert they give you a complementary custard pastry that was the perfect ending! The minor glitches that kept this review from being 5-stars were the vegetables that they serve with the entree - chard that was bitter and that none of us liked at all and that we had to ask three times to get a second plastic bag in which to bring home our leftovers.

HIGHLY recommend the bulgogi banh mi with the green spice bomb (it's a spicy cilantro cream based sauce with great flavor and not super spicy). The meat is packed with flavor has the perfect balance of sweet and savory with the pickled vegetables adding a great crunch. Love the surprises of jalapeño in the sandwich- next time will ask for more. The bread is great- perfectly crunchy without being stale or too difficult to chew. We also got the kimchi fries with beef bulgogi. The fries itself were great. I THINK the only thing they really add is kimchi, green onions, and spicy mayo. I do wish there was shredded cheese, jalapeños,.. it just needs a tad more. We are from Texas and love our Chilantro's kimchi fries and these weren't to that level.

I ordered the JoJu bowl (BBQ pork and caramelized pork) with cabbage salad, added spring rolls, and green sauce. The bowl was bigger than I expected and it definitely made me rlly full. I thought the BBQ pork was a little too dry for me but the caramelized pork tasted as good as it looked - savory and a little bit of sweetness combined. Spring rolls were a nice addition and the green sauce gave a little kick to the bowl. However, I do recommend getting it with rice instead of cabbage salad since I started to lose taste of the meat after a while because there was a lot of sliced cabbage as the base. My less sweetened Thai iced tea was honestly the perfect amount of sweetness so that was rlly satisfying.Our order was to go so I didn't get to try the banh mi fries at its finest first seconds of crispiness but the radishes on top mix well, giving the fries a light and crunchy accompaniment.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"To preface this review, I was here ages ago (20+ yrs) back when it was called Greenfield's. \\xa0It is nice to see that it still exists and that it's so beautifully decorated. \\xa0While there are plenty of proteins served, I do miss the rabbit and the many variations of beef options they used to have. \\xa0It seems times have changed the menu quite a bit. \\xa0Gone are the wooden cues - red for stop, green for more food. \\xa0They have been replaced by square shaped business cards (red on one side, green on the other) to signal the staff that you want more grub.I was here on Monday, Memorial day for an early dinner, group of 15 (adults and kids alike). \\xa0Confusing start as some items were included in the one price point vs the other (they differentiate between the salad bar vs the all you can eat) and there is no dessert or drinks included in the price per person. \\xa0Those are all a la carte. \\xa0A full beverage and cocktail menu is available - ranging from soda, juice, Brazilian soda, Mexican Coke, ie.Adding to the confusion were the kids' pricing - ages 4-10 were one price, regardless the rotation of meat or not. \\xa0Then any child 11+ had the option of the salad bar only or the all you can eat meat as well. \\xa0Price difference obviously stated, was approx $10 more for the AYCE meat.Our waitress was very friendly and helpful in getting us all that we asked for. \\xa0We noticed the servers were not coming over to us as much as we'd like...partly due to where we sat. If you can, request for a table near the salad bar or in the main dining area. \\xa0We sat just outside of that, by the windows and the cocktail Bar. \\xa0This is also where the TVs are at. \\xa0While dining, I saw most of the servers with their meat skewers on display walking around the main dining area first so by the time it made it over to us, there was a lot of meat gone.We also noticed the variety of meat that was being paraded around was the basically chicken, sirloin, or pork ribs. \\xa0So, we took note with the waitress and started ordering on demand - which worked out way better. \\xa0Duck was not available (we asked), though it is advertised. We ended up requesting quail, Lamb, and cheese bread. Not quite the fresh pan Con queso but it'll do. Bite sized cheese bread is always a win.The bacon wrapped anything was delicious. The quail was really good too but a bit on the small side. Best thing actually was the grilled pineapple and the medium rare steak. My group and I had a fun evening nonetheless once we go to dessert. They had chocolate cake, tiramisu, passion fruit mousse, cheesecake and red velvet cake. There may have been one or two more but I can't seem to recall now.BTW, the salad bar does have meat entrees in it so if you're not a big eater, it could be a good option. Pasta with meatballs was available, fries, chicken nuggets, fish, lots of different salads, and a yummy beef stew type option with potatoes. But alas, I came for the all you can eat meat so I only made one pass at the salad bar. It was just to get my veggies in. LOL So this review was just three stars as some of the meat was only ok. I expected more variety and I didn't like that it was all you can eat only on the meat. For the premium price, it should've included a soft drink or one dessert option. They should just create that option.\",\n",

Cheese bread was a joke ( only if you request) I'm so regret that we went there for my mom birthday. \\xa0We won't ever be going back again and I dont recomend this place. The service was ok.

I got a call from family in Canada who was coming into town for a birthday and their anniversary celebration. He wanted to celebrate and needed help in rounding up folks to attend and share in the festivities, as well as help finding a location. I took to Yelp and landed on MTM. I tried to make a reservation on Open Table for the at first 20 persons. But because of the number of attendees I had to call directly to the restaurant. Enter Adnan, the owner/chef who advised the process for reservation and we booked. Sunday rolled around and we dwindled down to 13 but it was a lucky 13! Unfortunately, we didn\\'t all make the reservation on time due to happenstance. But \\xa0MTM staff was still responsive and greeted us upon entering. They were cordial and responsive to our even smallest requests throughout the evening. The location is in a quiet neighborhood across from Ricardo\\'s. It\\'s family owned and operated which I think lent to the overall feeling of a great time. The bar pours?!? WHEW!!! Yes and yes!! My honey doesn\\'t tend to like a lot of ice in his Jack because it gets watered down. There was a lot of ice in his glass. But it didn\\'t deter from the actual pour to his pleasant surprise! I had the Moscow Mule...the pour was so good I didn\\'t need a 2nd since I was driving. Others had martinis and they loved those as well. On to the food...apps included broiled shrimp, crab cakes and scallops. For me, the shrimp were too little, although they were full of flavor. The crab cakes were flat which concerned me. However, it\\'s actual crab meat and flavor was on POINT! We ended up getting about 4 orders of it because it was so good. I didn\\'t have the scallops but our table partners did and they loved them. Entrees included prime rib, filet mignon, salmon, lamb chops, chicken parm, and sliced steak. Let\\'s just say the only complaint was because the initial bite of the prime rib wasn\\'t medium well. Side dishes were asparagus, mashed potatoes, onion rings, cream spinach. Seasoning was not limited to salt & pepper...THANK YOU ADNAN! Everything we ate was delicious! We finished the night with dessert for the birthday boy and anniversary couple!! The tiramisu was also delicious and the tartufo, which was new to us all, was DELISH!!! Adnan came out at the end and greeted us. He was complimented on the quality of the food which he stated was \"made with love\". We could tell and we appreciated it because it was a night to celebrate love! We toasted with MTM Martini shots which was just the perfect topper! Many thanks to Adnan and family for your hospitality. We plan to make this event an annual one and hope to be back again. Even without our Canadian fam, my honey and I will DEFINITELY be back!!!',\n",

Restaurant interior and exterior decor is nice and clean2. Most of the staff have good energy3. They remembered it was my mother's birthday. A slice of chocolate cake with a song at the end of the dinner.Cons:1. Mosquitos in outdoor seating - my party of 4 was getting bit up by mosquitos. The restaurant did not have any mosquito repellant such as candles or torches despite being aware of the situation. They just stated that we're near a park so it is what it is. This is a big oversight and likely why the outdoor seating area was empty.2. Amateur service - the overall staff was a mix bunch. Generally nice but forgetful and unaware of their surroundings. A) The check still billed for a wrong order despite the person saying they'll remove it. Also, we had to ask for the check 3 times over the span of 20 minutes before finally getting it.B) A waitor and waitress brushed up on my back 7 times without apology despite there being about 3 feet of space between myself and the next table. I was already sitting very close to the edge of my table.C) There were 2 tables with loud toddlers screaming on and off for an hour until they tired out. The staff did nothing to say something to the parties to quiet their kids down. Needless to say, this was a major annoyance.3. Food is okay, but not great - I had higher expectations of this place given the overall positive reviews. The food was not anything memorable. The medium rare porterhouse steak at this steakhouse was not tender, just mushy and mostly flavorless. If you've had Peter Luger or similar, this place will disappoint. A seasoned home cooked steak will taste better honestly.\"},\n",

We ordered food and i personally didn't care for the chicken and waffles or the avocado toast but the Mac and cheese was excellent so i definitely recommend that. I ordered a sprite which was flat and my friend got drinks which ended up being so much more expensive then any other place we've been to and a lot weaker than what we were expecting (considering it was a mimosa that's saying something). Maybe because it was disgustingly hot that i couldn't breath or the fact that the food was a bit sub par, or maybe it was the flies floating around the restaurant but i definitely do not recommend this place.

Moving along, the avocado was okay, but it was slathered in a thousand island like dressing and sundried tomatoes. It was just a really odd combination.

Head to the back and bag your variety of seafood: lots of fish variety, clams, squid, crab, scallops, octopus, shrimp. Then when you pay you can choose how they cook your order: basically fried or grilled. Pick your sides of Greek salad, garlic bread, lemon potatoes, etc, to finish the ordering.Highly recommend the grilled scallops and fried calamari; I could eat those everyday. The grilled seasoning and predominant olive oil they use to cook things is basic, but absolutely delicious.We showed up at opening lunch on a weekday with no table wait. Peak times (weekend dinner) I've heard are the worst so avoid if you are starving and don't want to wait.

This way I don't stand up later on with a piece of octopus stuck to my behind. Looked down at our plates and there's olive oil on the edges. No big deal, I switched the plates out for a clean set. My plastic fork had some dirty specks, and the female server sees me wiping it down. She gives me a dirty stare as if I had offended her and snatches the fork out of my hand, and switches it out for a new one. No smile, no apologies, just a pissed off look. While I couldn't tell whether she was jokingly upset or really upset, I was already having a not so pleasant experience. Food-Grilled red snapper was the best item amongst all our dishes. Calamari was fried so can't really go wrong. Had to ask for lemons and sauce (tarter only). Clams were grilled which was probably not the right cooking method. It had an over grilled burnt smell and the clams were very chewy. Some of our shells didn't even open up fully. We gave up after eating 2 clams b/c the plastic fork experience was not doing it. Grilled scallops was nothing special. Grilled jumbo shrimp was tough which was a waste b/c they're $22.50/lb. Grilled octopus came out cold. We ordered a lot for 2 ppl. We were sharing a table with 2 other ppl so table space was limited. We had empty plates and instead of clearing it off the table, our server just piled the other dishes on top of it like it was a game of jenga. I don't know if she just didn't like us after I wiped down my fork or she was overwhelmed from the chaos, but we asked another server to help clear the dishes. While I understand that this is a no frills/ market type of experience and I was not expecting any fine dining treatment, but the terrible service exceeded my expectations for mediocre food. If the place wasn't as chaotic, perhaps the cooks would've been able to add a pinch more garlic and salt to our dishes. If I were to ever come back, it would only be during lunch hours on a weekday where most ppl are at work and I so happen to be in the area. For the time being, I have no intention of coming back.\"},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I love me a good Thai lunch special, and Kin'd delivered just that. The restaurant is spacious and modern on the inside. Great spot to dine with a group or for a date. To eat I had the crispy tofu app with side salad, followed by the Spicy Basil sauteed with chicken. The tofu was nicely fried, and the peanut dressing on the salad was delish but maybe a bit too much dressing for my taste. The spicy basil entree was a good portion size for lunch. It is served with jasmine rice; mine was a bit stale but soaked up the sauce well and helped balance the salt of the dish. Pretty salty affair, but very tasty. My date had the Bangkok wings which reminded me of chicken nuggets (in a good way), followed by the Drunken noodles with chicken. The drunken noodles were the highlight of the meal, but only had 2 pieces of chicken in it. Still, tasted soooooo good. Both dishes were marked as 'spicy' on the menu, but we both could have used a bit more spice. I will be back for my own order of drunken noods and to try the lychee thai tea!!\",\n",

This time however, I\\'m happy to report that they corrected that and now suggest the tip based on the sub-total. The only thing I did not like was that when I spoke to the owner, she said \"Oh, but everyone does it like that\".

It deserves a 3.5 star rating, so I\\'ll round UP rather than down because they corrected that practice.

The location is fine with easy street parking across the street.There are two issues however.First, the serious issue is that when they give you the check, they suggest what a 15%, 18% or 20% tip would be. Normally that would be fine. The problem is that they are calculating those \"suggested tips\" based on the total meal AFTER taxes! That is not only incorrect to do that but illegal. Imagine each couple paying a dollar or more extra because of that. It should be based on the sub-total before the tax!What\\'s worse is that I brought that same issue up with them a few months back. They said they\\'d correct it. Obviously they give service with a smile while stabbing you in the back and cheating you just a little!That\\'s the worst kind of merchant.If I see it a third time, I will report them and their practices to the sales & use tax division of the Department of Finance.The other thing was their veggie dumplings.

As soon as we walked in the door, we were greeted by a friendly and enthusiastic owner. Being a first timer and a novice to authentic Italian cuisine, our waitress was very attentive and accommodating, answering any questions that we had.We started off our meal with a phenomenal bruschetta. The best I ever had. It was so well seasoned, topped with tomato that was so tasty that it just blown my mind. We then ordered a pasta with marinara sauce and the fish special, which was a generous serving of fillet of sole with an assortment of vegetables. Both dishes were cooked to perfection and needless to say, we send back nothing but clean plates. Also to note, the fact that the price of the specials were clearly listed on the menu demonstrates the kind of respect that the owner has for his diners. So hats off to you for that.We capped off our meal with an excellent homemade Napolean to share. I generally am not a fan of Napolean but the one we had tasted amazing. The flaky pastry paired so well with the rich but not too rich fresh cream. At the end of our dessert, we were served complimentary Limoncello which just made us feel even more welcome than we already did.Thank you again for a great meal and evening.

       "  'Negative Review 1': 'My thoughts as a chef of 10 years. And, as a neighborhood dad: 1. tone down the attitude at brunch when your restaurant has 4 tables seated. One table was a solo diner at that.2. as a server taking orders from a table, people may hesitate. The wrong thing to say to them is, \"Oh. So you\\'re not ready.\"3. if the food is running more than 20 minutes late, pop by the table and thank them for the patience. Maybe bring them more water. Especially if there\\'s only 4 tables seated. 4. If there are children at the table, make sure their food didn\\'t forget to be made. You\\'re lucky my kid is pretty chill but it\\'s annoying that all the adults have their food and we\\'re waiting on pancakes. Especially when the table that came after us with a kid got their food before us. That is particularly bad form.5. Have syrup, not honey in a plastic bottle. It\\'s a small detail that shows you\\'re paying attention to things. 6. If you\\'re charging $15 for a hamburger and you ask the customer how he wants it cooked, make an effort to cook it to the right temp. And don\\'t serve day-old salad as a side that\\'s clearly red and oxidized, limp and warm. That\\'s just rude. 7. When the customer has politely informed you that the burger is cooked very well done, there is one right response: \"apologies, can I bring you something else?\" Not: * is this your first time here? Then you know our food is good* sometimes that happens* i insist on bringing you dessert8. when you bring dessert, and I ask you if there is booze or coffee in the dessert so I can share it with my child, there is ONE right response, either: * yes  \\xa0or* no9. The WRONG response to a customer asking you if there is booze or coffee in the dessert, so I can share it with my child is NOT: * it has a little coffee, it\\'s fine. She\\'ll be fine.

We got lucky with parking, but you\\'ll have to fight for street parking at certain times. Came again with a friend a couple of days ago and everything seems to be the same as I remembered.I started off with a Thai Iced Tea and the Combination Spring Rolls (Regular and Spicy) to share. I probably should\\'ve told them less sweet, but this was just as overly sweet as I remembered from last time (Okay, I really should\\'ve been smarter). I got the Red Curry with Chicken and a side of Brown Rice while my friend got the Pad See Ew. My Red Curry: The flavors were all there, but I didn\\'t like how the texture of the curry was gritty. It seemed like they keep it boiling for so long that some vegetables or meat were disintegrating and creating that dissolved texture. I\\'m not mad about it, but I didn\\'t enjoy it as much because of the texture. The flavors were perfect though and the medium spice level was that nice amount of spice for me! The Pad See Ew: Now, my friend is a huge fan of Kin\\'d because Kin\\'d tends to be more heavy handed with their flavors, aka saltier. I quote my friend when I say, \"The Pad See Ew is more mild than the one at Kin\\'d\". I don\\'t think this necessarily is a bad sign, but I don\\'t think my friend would come back as he prefers the flavors at Kin\\'d. I did taste that SriPraPhai\\'s Pad See Ew was less flavorful than Kin\\'d, but I normally eat less salty so I thought it was okay. Service: The waitress that served us was super nice though! We asked to move outside and she warned us beforehand about bugs and caterpillars if we moved. Loved that she always had a smile on her face. Very sweet!

When my husband was at the last quarter of his drink, he remarked that he felt the symptoms he usually gets when he drinks alcohol. Sure enough, I saw him getting flushed and dizzy. While he doesn't have a full-on alcohol allergy, the symptoms are strong enough that he avoids alcohol altogether. We asked the server if she had accidentally put in an order for the alcoholic lemonade (that has soju) but she hadn't. The server checked with the bartender and told us that the bartender didn't remember which drink she had made because she had made so many, so it was possible that it did have soju in it. I found this worrying because my husband could have had a more serious reaction. If anything, there needs to be a better system to distinguish the alcoholic drinks from the non-alcoholic ones. They comped us for the drink, which was a nice gesture. We'll still come back for the great food and atmosphere, but will probably avoid the non-bottled drinks in the future.\",\n",

A man approached me and was just standing and staring at me, not moving. One of the valet guys actually came over to check on me and make sure I was okay - which I thought was a great gesture. Now onto the food, we started with a few apps: calamari, prosciutto & mozzarella, caesar salad, stuffed mushrooms. All phenomenal, especially the stuffed mushrooms. We could have eaten triple. For entrees, I got the langoustines, my brother got the chicken parm, my dad got the shrimp fri diablo, and my mom the veal parm. They all loved their dishes but I can't speak enough about the langoustines. They were AMAZING. We devoured them. It came with a side of pasta and not a bite went uneaten. Really enjoyed this place. We all said the only place it came second to was Il Mulino in the city, otherwise, probably the best we've had.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'What a disappointment. Many close friends recommended this place to us, so we had very high expectations. From the moment we walked in we felt unwelcomed. The lady at the front desk didn\\'t bother to even greet us, the only thing she asked me was if I had a reservation with a very irritated face. We had a reservation at 7:30pm and we were not seated until 9pm. We waited close to 20 minutes before our waiter came to the table. The waiter was very nasty and arrogant. As he was giving us the menus he didn\\'t even bother to greet us or even look at us, it felt like greeting customers wasn\\'t the norm in this restaurant. Our drinks took way to long to arrive considering that the bar was just 20 steps away. My wife and I were debating whether to stay or leave because everything was just going downhill. We were ready to place our order but our waiter was nowhere to be found, my wife was fed up so she got up to look for our waiter and turns out our waiter was too busy enjoying a nice glass of wine and texting on his phone. At this point I was ready to walk out, but we were starving and we waited over an hour and a half and we didnt think anything else can get worse, but it did. As an appetizer we had a stuffed artichoke which was delicious, no complains about the food so far. For our entree we decided to share the Park Side T-Bone steak. We ordered the steak medium rare, which in any restaurant in New York will be ready in no more then 30 minutes. It wasn\\'t busy, an hour had past and neither our food or our waiter were anywhere to be found. We tried asking other staff for our waiter and it felt as if everyone was avoiding us. We kept waving at the staff until the front desk lady decided to step in. We asked if we may please see our waiter and explained that it\\'s been a very long time and we were still waiting for our food. Her response was \"I don\\'t cook the food, just wait\" she then proceeded to call someone else over because she felt that as customers we were not worthy of her time. She called over a big young man that was wearing a tuxedo, at that moment we thought that maybe he was the manager, but he then explained to us that he was just a waiter, at least he was friendly and willing to help. He ran to the kitchen and brought our food to the table. Our T-bone was undercooked and the sauce on our pasta was bland, and it was obviously sitting in the kitchen for a while. After 15 minutes of sitting there eating, my original waiter decided to check up on us. We asked him what happened and why did our food take a long time to come. His response was \"I dont know, that\\'s how things are here this isn\\'t McDonald\\'s.\" After hearing that my wife couldn\\'t even look at him and dismissed him from the table. We asked the busboy (which was very helpful) if he can call over the other waiter that brought out our food. As he was leaving our table our waiter called over the busboy and asked him what was wrong and said something along the lines of \" That lady is crazy\" in Spanish. We finally got a hold of the other young waiter and he proceeded to apologize and offered to treat us to coffee and dessert, but we declined. Him, the busboy and the stuffed artichoke were the only positive things we experienced on our first and last time at the park side. We asked to speak to the manager, but the manager never approached us. We paid the check and left. The food is not bad but the service as a whole in this place is ridiculous. If you like waiting hours to be seated and like being disrespected by the staff then go to Park Side. I will never walk back into this place.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"My new favorite Italian spot! Upon walking in, you could tell it was a local favorite as it was crowded around 2 pm on a Saturday. We were seated in the green room which was the perfect lunchtime setting. After reading some reviews, we ordered calamari and crab cakes. The calamari was decent - not too crispy/fried. The crab cakes were not what I expected, they weren't coated in bread crumbs, it was basically the crab mushed into a patty and served with mangos. It paired very well and tasted very fresh. For entrees, we had the lamb chops and chicken Parmesan. The lamb chops were perfectly seasoned but to my dismay, were smaller than expected. It was served with potato knishes and fried zucchini chips which I loved! The chicken parmigiana was hands down my favorite - there is no other way to describe it but as perfection. The bill ran us about $100, which was a little pricey, but decent for the portion sizes. I would visit again for the green room dining experience and chicken parm!!\",\n",

The problem with this restaurant is the front of the house. It's poorly run and operated. The staff members act as if they dont care, there's no interaction, no service, it's just down right awful. We were seated in the garden area. Promptness of food arrival was ok. We asked for the two young men who in our previous visit assisted us, and were told they no longer work there. What a shame.

No apologies, they never visit table to see how the food is they are too busy checking phones or gabbing with other employees.Such a shame.

You are welcomed right from the moment you walk in - which is great because I guess as Westerners you feel a little off when you walk into a restaurant like this.

After a long day in the city we decided to come to Hahm Ji Bach restaurant which serves Korean food Upon our arrival we were seated near the door and we decided to order the Goat Casserole for 3 people and few other Korean dishes. While we were waiting there were people celebrating their birthday and the restaurant played birthday music which was so loud that everyone was cringing their faces I mean it was so loud. Don't understand why they had to play the music so loud enough for a club . Finally When they brought out the Goat casserole it was so blend that we couldn't eat it. When we told this to the waitress they had this dumb look in their face like what do you want us to do. No one came to apologize and we had to tell them to take it back and bring a new Goat casserole out. I don't think we will be coming back to this location again. It's not like how it use to be.

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'I like Bund... a lot. I\\'m so happy there\\'s finally an authentic Chinese restaurant in Astoria (authentic = NOT American takeout and usually sticks to ONE cuisine in the restaurant). Honestly, I read some of the reviews here and they are petty af, these people really shouldn\\'t be eating out. Here\\'s the thing, my rule with rating authentic Asian restaurants is to never rate the service because that\\'s not what I\\'m here for. I\\'m straight up here for food. As usual, I always get the soup dumplings. The pork soup dumplings are deliciously rich and slightly sweet. I just tried their shrimp soup dumplings and those are lighter but still tasty. I don\\'t think the place automatically gives you the vinegar unless you ask for it, probably because they\\'re used to the demographic of the neighborhood to not know how to use the vinegar. The cucumber salad is great as well. Just slightly wilted with garlic and salt. Soft yet still has that crunchiness a shanghainese cucumber salad would give you. I love their mushroom salad. It is a very shanghainese dish that goes very well with rice because it adds a lot of flavor and also slightly salty. Overall, Astoria doesn\\'t have a lot of restaurants I listed on my \"repeat\" list (places i genuinely want to go to or have gone to again and again ex: Astoria Seafood, Taverna Kyclades, Koroni Souvlaki and Grill, Los Portales) and Bund is on that list.',\n",

Noodles are pretty big so would recommend getting to share unless you're not getting appetizer. Prices are great, spent less than $30 for two appetizers and an entree. Really happy to finally see an authentic Chinese place in Astoria! I think they're in their soft opening phase so the menu is a little limited, hope they expand on that.

So when Bund opened I was excited to have one much closer to home. But I was slightly disappointed in the flavoring. The cucumber appetizer and soup dumplings were waaayyy too sweet. Tasted like they tossed in a bunch of sugar. I got sick of the taste pretty quickly. \\xa0The pan fried rice cakes were good but too oily. You could see a pool of oil sitting at the bottom and the food was doused in it. The service is average. We had ordered a pork soup dumpling and a crabmeat soup dumping. As we started eating the second basket of dumplings we thought it was strange that it tasted exactly like the first basket of soup dumplings. But because we were disappointed by the flavoring already we just chocked it up to an inexperienced chef. We didn't realize they gave us two pork dumpling baskets until I noticed in other yelp photos that the crabmeat dumpling is supposed to have the telltale orange peak. Because we had already eaten everything already we didn't mention it to the staff, but I was kind of disappointed by the situation. I don't want to make it sound like they have bad food. There's certainly potential. I would just advise that they lessen the amount of sugar they add to the flavoring of the food and less oil too.\",\n",

The udon was decent but way too salty and nothing special.Service: When we entered, there was no one in the hostess stand and two people sitting at a table.

The moment we said we were dining in, the two seated people immediately jumped from their seats to serve us. I didn't realize they were waiters and was a bit peeved they had us wait even though they weren't doing anything and knew we were there. The hostess had a bad attitude greeting us and seating us and the waiters provided the bare minimum service. Atmosphere: The place looked bright and clean, but the tables were SO sticky.

All of the dishes tasted really good, but the spicy pork veg wontons surprised me. I thought the veg part would be cabbage or something. I definitely wasn't expecting the watercress (?) in it. Was pleasantly surprised though to be given a three-tiered stack of baskets, when we only ordered two. When it came time to settle the bill, I asked, and was told they offer a complimentary basket of soup dumplings on orders over $10. And they've been doing it for 5 years straight.I do wish I knew of this earlier, though, so perhaps I wouldn't have ordered as much. Came out stuffed.

For a vegetarian, that means not XLB, but rather steamed veggie dumplings, chive pockets, tzong-yo mien (scallion noodles), and cold dishes like kao-fu (baked tofu).All of the food here was just as good as Nan Xiang. The steamed veggie dumplings were filled with a delicious medley of what I presume to be leeks, eggs, and glass noodles, and paired perfectly with a bit of vinegar and ginger on a spoon. The chive pocket was a bit more deep fried than I tend to prefer, but the filling was still good (take note it does contain dried shrimp). Scallion noodles could have been a bit more flavorful, but still a solid option.If I have one complaint, it is the efficient but rather impersonal seating set-up. You order while waiting so by the time you sit (for us it was about a 40 minute wait on a Friday evening at 8:40) your food comes out shortly. But as soon as you've taken the last bite, a sweet soup is promptly delivered to the table with a clear message.\",\n",

It's not flashy, or even particularly fancy, but it tastes great and there was clearly thought and effort put in. My favorite dish over the two visits was the mole de piaxlta. The meat was tender and very flavorful. I also enjoyed the guacamole. On my second visit I had the chiles nogada, a traditional seasonal specialty. The dish consists of a pablano pepper stuffed with meat and dried fruits topped with a creamy sauce. I found that there wasn't as much meat as I'd have liked, and it was pretty sweet. I'd say it was a good dish but not very amenable to my tastes. The high quality carries through to the drinks and desserts. Both the tres leches and cheese ice cream were excellent; they were also very rich and filling.It tells you a lot that this is the only restaurant I repeated in a few weeks in New York.

I actually had read on their website they had molletes, my absolute favorite breakfast from Mexico that I grew up with my mom making and had looked forward to them all day. Imagine my disappointment to enter and see they had removed them from the menu - could have cried tbh. But, I had the huevos rancheros they were very good. It's rare to find huevos rancheros that are made as I know them to be in Mexico in the United States and these were the closest to them I've had here. They were tasty with a nice little kick.

We understand that it does get crazy busy because it\\'s a great deal, but for such deal, management should be aware to have extra staff or organization for such day. Our server was rude, no greeting and super sweaty, he literally looked like he was running a marathon. We felt bad for him because he looked so overwhelmed. Anyway, then a roach was crawling on our table, and we called management, the manager apologized and we accept it with no problem, i mean bad things happen... Then we asked for our bill, and we realized we were overcharged with at least $100 extra from what we really consumed. It was awful, we were 10 people, we did 3 rounds of tacos and 3 rounds of $2 Margaritas and 4 coronas. That\\'s super easy math. We tried to locate the manager but he was no where to be found. At the is point we were just pissed. Since we were 10 people we decided to just go and split the $100 and give free $10 to Mamajuana for such a bad service. It\\'s terrible because the food is actually good. Reply for Oscar,I understand the fact that you must keep your business with a great look. I totally get it. But we definitely did not consume the amount of tacos we were billed for, because why would i go out of way to write such review? And you are right, my account is new because i felt disappointed for what we went through, and somehow it felt unfair to just let it slide, which is a good reason of \"hey, why not rate\". Regarding to the pitcher of margarita that was brought to the table, it doesn\\'t excuse the workflow performed or the lack of communication with the server. The pitcher (2$ margarita mix pitcher, not 90$ \\xa0worth \\xa0mojito as you mentioned) was no comfort for us.

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'Hi Flushing Yelpers and friends. \\xa0I\\'m so happy I discovered the leaf Rooftop Bar in Flushing. BIG thanks to our local Yelp CM Jando who let us know about Flushing\\'s finest sunset spot. Leaf Bar is Located on the tippy top of the new Hyatt hotel in Downtown \\xa0Flushing, NY. Just 2 blocks from my residence and I didn\\'t even know it was here. Well now I do ! Wifey and I decided to do Advanced Recon the night before the Labor Day party. Emerging from the rooftop floor elevator of the Hyatt on 39th Ave (a block north of Roosevelt Ave.& west of Main Street. The first thing you see is one of their huge screen TVs with the ball game on. The vibe tonight was excited and vibrant. You could hear the din of the folk\\'s exuberance. Wifey and I were escorted to experience one of Flushing\\'s most beautiful views. Our rooftop seating looked Westward, with the sunset to starlit skies of Manhattan before us in awe, beauty and splendor.Wife said the view was really breathtaking. Our waitress brought out two complementary shots from the manager to welcome his first time customers. We\\'re loving the place already.(Part 2) Labor Day rooftop party. Time to relax friends. Wifey and I returned to Leaf bar the next day. there was a Yelp advertised Labor Day rooftop party. That I learned about from my Yelp friend Jando. We\\'re not going to miss this. I needed to check out their foods, and there was a bottle of wine I just had to try. I had used my Yelp page to invite many friends from the area to this event. And they showed up. I have to thank my wonderful server, she also was the server from our the night before. She was on point and always there for every need we had. I love great service. sometimes it\\'s more important than the food. The food on the rooftop was really outstanding this afternoon. Really hungry, we ordered 2 types of buffalo wings, crispy gyoza dumplings, cheeseburger spring rolls, Blue Moon beer, lemonades and a bottle of most delicious Argentinian wine. Highly recommended, the \"Terrazas de los Andes\" 2013, ia a Single vineyard, Los Aromos, Cabernet Sauvignon. ($120.) After decanting for 20 minutes, this Cav was just so deliciously smooth, it was like drinking liquid gold. Made the entire afternoon. Then mother nature decided to put on the most spectacular sunset show. Channeling the great artists Van Gogh and Monet. The sunset on the last day of August took on an surrealistic, impressionistic feeling. Accented by the wonderful company and that kicking Cab Sav, the heavens over Manhattan became as colorful and exciting as a Grucci fireworks display. All I could do was watch in amazement. Dusk turned to twilight and evening. All the lights of the city twinkled to life and The DJ started rocking, the crowd here really lit it up. So Happy Leaf bar just a few steps away in my neighborhood. Stock up on that incredible, Cav Sav. we\\'ll be back again soon.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"This place is overrated and quality of food/drink has declined over the past few years. The vibe is mostly 20-something millennials with a sprinkle of a few hotel guests on any given Friday or Saturday night. See and be seen. Cocktails are sweet and overpriced. \\xa0The bartenders remain the same. In this case, not sure if that's a good or bad sign. They've been making the same cocktails over and over for years. Instead of refining them to a tee, they're watered down and inconsistent. The outdoor area is a nice touch with comfortable lounging. Views leave much to be desired for a rooftop setting. Come for a round of drinks, maybe. Fair warning, you may leave feeling unsatisfied and ripped off. Cheers!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Made reservations for here on Saturday night at 11pm. Was seated promptly on the rooftop. I thought it would be too hot or too cold but the weather was really nice that day! - warm with a light breeze.I was here with 3 others - we all got drinks, i ordered the adult calpico. Although im not a big drinker, the drink tasted decently strong to me. (I think it contained soju, calpico, and marshmallow syrup) didnt really taste the marshmallow syrup but it did come with a marshmallow topping!Service was def not attentive at all. Had to wave and yell for the waiter to notice us, and sometimes had to ask for things twice.The food was decent- we ordered things like popcorn chicken and fries. Came out quickly as well! It was a really chill atmosphere and we did not feel rushed at all as we stayed there for about 2 hours. The 4 of us spent 113 without tip - just a little under the $120 \"mininum\" and they didnt really say anything so I guess the $30 pp rule is not strictly enforced. This price is not bad for drinks and food! Overall would come again for cheap drinks/food and the cool atmosphere.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': \"Used to come here quite often but the past weekend was my first time in a while and I was surprised to find out that they implemented a minimum spend amount in order to be seated?!I was taken back a bit that a bar in flushing is enforcing such a rule when very high end bars in Manhattan dont even do that. I'm not trying to say that Flushing isn't upscale but this isnt like a comedy club where such policies are acceptable/common. Moves like this come off as catering to your margins over your customers and simply in poor taste.I would say a majority of the people who come to leaf come from flushing/queens and are just looking for a place to hang out on the weekends. The last thing they want is to feel judged when trying to wind down after a rough week in their own 'home/neighborhood'. Very pretentious for a place that shouldnt be. The tougher pill to swallow was that by 10 oclock the place started emptying out significantly anyway, makes you think: did the doorman insist on the drink minimum after 10:30 to 11:00 when it was empty? Probably not, which just makes the move seem driven by greed.Food, service, and drinks were good. My review is only based on my experience walking in and being told that I have to spend a certain amount to sit down. I can garuntee that my party wouldve spent more money had we not been given those stipulations and had our mood ruined.It makes a lot more sense to ask guests who are loitering and not ordering enough drinks to simply order more. Instead of upfront telling people at the door.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': 'The roof top bar was great. The vibe, seating, view, and space. The bartender was a ass. Like we were ruining his day to that he had to serve drinks. People were at bar, ignored them and then saexaatic do you want a drink.....duhhh or dooohhh...',\n",

We booked for 6:30 pm on a Friday evening and we were seated , ordered at 6:40 and then we were told that it is a 30 $ minimum per person after 7 but since we might be her past 7 pm then that includes us ( also we weren't told about the 30 $ minimum on reservation ) while this is happening , we were asked to move to a different table as they are expecting a bigger group .

For my starter I had Bañh mi sliders which was really good!. I enjoyed it more than my entree. For my entree I had slow cooked beef short ribs that was served with a papaya salad. The ribs was really good, but I didn\\'t enjoy my papaya salad. I wish it came with something different because I ended up eating just the ribs by itself \"which I got tired of eating after a while.

       "  'Negative Review 3': \"2 stars and only for service - staff was prompt and friendly however I cannot justify paying $20 for a bowl of pho and still leave unsatisfied. Fiancé and I drove all the way from Brooklyn bc we heard good things about their noodle soups and we were craving Vietnamese food at the time. We ordered the District pho that everyone was raving about online however it was extremely mediocre; broth was not flavorful enough. Doesn't even taste like they used any real beef bones to cook the pho broth which is standard for any authentic bowl of beef pho.. The cherry on top is that any additional toppings cost extra - we ordered tendon and tripe and that was $2-3 extra...in summary, overpriced mediocre Asian food. My Fiancé is Vietnamese so we have had abundant experience eating out at Vietnamese places around the country and also making it at home and everything has honestly been much better than what this restaurant has to offer. Sadly The Vietnamese food scene in nyc remains a disappointment\"},\n",

This event holds a special place in my heart. \\xa0I sat on a hill at the end of devouring all different types of food and watched people play,dance,sing and of course eat/drink without a concern of time . It was well into the night (9pm) and everyone was enjoying their time here without a care in the world. I love the artists they have dancers,DJ's and singers from all walks of life . Hawaiian dancers made my night they put on a great performance as well as the singing acts all free just bring a blanket to sit on or grab a picnic table seat. Food: ChefBoyarNetty was there tonight (missed her in July) and was worth the wait. \\xa0I love her personality and her food definitely was the bomb. She ran out of Soul Food Cupcakes before I got there ,but I hit her up on Instagram and she held one for me ! It was a cornbread cupcake with Mac n cheese inside with a pillowy bed of mashed potatoes ontop adorned with a delicious crispy chicken wing(5) I also had a dish of Mac n cheese and wings (6) that was equally great. I did purchase a biscuit to go with it (3) !Brazilian Steak Sandwich was next up on a smoked chipotle cheese bun. Spicy sauce ,but in a good way . I loved the bun and the steak was soft and seasoned well. It was lettuce, tomato and red onion taking it up a notch. Cotton Candy for dessert ? This line was long yet they moved quickly . They have around 10 choices of design. Flowers and characters($7/8). They have a bunny that will make anyone smile very cute . I chose the duckie and when I walked around with this on a stick all eyes were on me ,lol. Everyone wanted to know where I got it from and they were on their way to get one too.\",\n",

I suggest you get there right when it opens or an hour beforehand to guarantee a spot it fills up fast. You will see that there is $25 parking right before if you don\\'t want to take that chance, it\\'s mostly parking for the baseball games, Mets Stadium is adjacent to the market. When you\\'re walking in you notice words on the fence that change weekly . \"My Super Hero\" reads today for all the Dads on Father\\'s Day weekend. Pretty cool picture/selfie moment ! Bring a backpack (you\\'ll thank me later) to set up your personal picnic on the open field there in the park where a DJ is stationed . They have beer/wine conveniently there too !  \\xa0My 1st stop was someone I have been following on IG , the Chinese Sugar Painting lady. \\xa0Very impressive! You could spin a wheel if you can\\'t choose a character or they have some displayed. My seven-year-old chose a dog (5.00) he said it tasted just like cotton candy .  Next Twisted Potato..... You can watch them spiral the potato and cook it . Flavors are ketchup, BBQ, Cajun, Buffalo, cheese, salt and vinegar, sour cream and onion or the one I got parmesan garlic. They sprinkle it from a shaker right out the grease. It\\'s airy and crispy very filling. \\xa0Twisting for Fun was up next . A balloonist that makes the coolest hats and more (5-6 bucks) my son decided on a squid for a hat very huge and cool. \\xa0Moffle Bar ------ I chose mochiko fried chicken ($5) with a plain moffle ($5) (stuffed with mochi) on the side and it\\'s amazing. The chicken was little battered nuggets that complimented the Moffle perfectly. You can have a soy sauce ontop ,but we chose to have it \\xa0plain .  They had beef sticks and chicken for sale we devoured them so fast I didn\\'t get a chance to take a picture or catch the name of the booth. I also tried Filipino ice cream called Ube (purple yam with coconut sport ) it\\'s supposed to come with turon( thinly sliced fried bananas) but I just wanted to try the ice cream today. Very good and not sweet. They put a little chocolate sauce on top. \\xa0I can\\'t wait to try more next week they\\'re open for a few more weekends !',\n",

The fries were hand cut from potatos, but a little underseasoned and soggy. The mac and cheese needed more cheese. The brisket was a bit dry, not much fat. I preferred the rib tips.

We were all so stuffed that we didn\\'t have room for dessert! \\xa0Next time, we will leave room, as their desserts all sounded very tempting. \\xa0What a great evening, with great company and delicious food! \\xa0A wonderful way to start the early birthday celebrations! \\xa0I look forward to many returns to Cote Soleil...there are many more dishes I\\'d love to try! \\xa0:)',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Milestone 700th review! (200th review for Cote Soleil if I timed this right.)Being born and raised in Queens I always loved this section of Skillman avenue in what is technically Woodside, but I always considered this Sunnyside. It seems that this area's popularity has grown since it has become much more difficult to park. Cote Soleil is a beautiful neighborhood gem that I would dine in weekly if I lived nearby.The space is small and the kitchen area large. It is nicely decorated with a classic comfortable French feel and music in the background. The service is some of the very best I've ever experienced - so warm and friendly. All the food here made me giddily happy because it is just so damn good!La Friand Au Brie - baked brie with honey is perhaps my favorite app from here. That cheese is so rich and decadent along with the crispy baked outside - SO GOOD!La terrine de foie gras - personally not a big foie gras fan, but fellow diners love this dish.Les Escargots Au Beurre Persille - I didn't eat the snails (rather have others try this), but you know I was dipping into that garlic butter!La Tartare De Boeuf Au Couteau we did as an appetizer since we were a large group of 7. It was so good and rich with a nice brightness to the raw beef.La Pizza A La Truffe - yes pizza - there was no tomato sauce just excellent cheese and truffle flavor on top of a crisp crust. Get this and be happy.After the ridiculous amount of excellent apps I was nearly full, but still ordered the Bouillabaisse as my entree. I did not regret this. It was a large satisfy bowl on a cold rainy night. Large piece of cod in the center surrounded by mussels and jumbo shrimp (peel on so dive in a make mess of yourself - it is worth it!). I loved the braised fennel in this and that creamy broth was so good. I also tried the Mac N' Cheese truffes au homard which was also amazingly good! large chunks of lobster and the cheese had an incredible seafood and truffle flavor. The wine list is very reasonably priced we had a nice Cotes du Rhone that was fantastic. Others had the sangria and they even make fresh lemonade for non-alcohol drinkers.\",\n",

Chocolate soufflé dessert along with #4 dessert(can't remember the name) which was delicious. Everything was amazing including the glass of bubbles to start with and the bottle of burgundy with dinner. The only complaint I have, and is the reason why I didn't give 5stars is, the only thing we didn't finish eating was half of my beef Bourgogne. I asked our waiter to please take it to go. And I noted to my husband there were 2 hefty size bits of beef we could bring home and our son could get a taste. When we got home and opened it, there was only 1 piece of beef and the rest was carrots, mushrooms and pearl onions. I actually thought the to-go-bag felt lighter than what I thought it should've been. \\xa0I hate to complain but to skim off a customer's plate which they've asked to take the rest of their meal to go is really the low of low for a restaurant and its employees.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Maxi's Noodle (雲吞妹; literally, 'Wonton Little Sister') is a Hong Kong-style wonton noodle shop that recently moved to Downtown Flushing, to a small space on 38th Avenue. There are approximately 9 two-seater tables that are configurable in a few ways. There is some bench seating available along the walls, otherwise seating is on red plastic stools. Having been to the new space twice in two weeks, I would say that Maxi's Noodle has done a good job acclimating to its new location and customer volume. Their wontons and dumplings are still the best in Queens, and their noodles are back to being great, too.Our favorite order to get is the egg noodles with three add-ons: beef stew, wonton, and dumplings. The fried fish skins, which sound unappetizing on name alone, are actually pretty good. The fish skins are fried to an airy crisp, and retain their crispiness when dunked in soup to add more flavor. Maxi's own chili oil is amazing; it's also available separately for sale at $6 per jar.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Maxi's Noodle (雲吞妹; literally, 'Wonton Little Sister') is a wonton noodle pop-up shop, currently hosted in the evenings at Kissena Café, except on Thursdays. Maxi's will be moving into their own location in Downtown Flushing in the short term (maybe a month or two) -- check their website or social media for the latest information on their move. Kissena Café is a small venue, with four tables of four seats, but one shouldn't encounter a problem with seating as it seems that most people order out. The café does not have a customer accessible bathroom.I think Maxi's Noodle has the best Hong Kong style wontons and dumplings in Queens, NY. Dishes We've Had:- Beef Stew Lo Mein (actually, Beef Brisket Lo Mein; 牛腩捞麵), with wontons (雲吞) and egg noodles(蛋麵): This is a superb noodle bowl for only $10. The egg noodles are bouncy and chewy, the wontons are substantive and made with fresh shrimp, and the beef brisket is excellent. The bowl also contains beef tendon, which I'm not a fan of, but I'm told this is well-executed, too. The dish comes with soup, but I find the included beef stew sauce to provide such excellent flavor that the soup is not needed.- Frozen Wontons and Frozen Dumplings (take-out): The wontons and dumplings are here large and substantive, made with fresh ingredients. Travel Logistics:- Four MTA bus routes are near Maxi's Noodles. 1-hour metered parking is available on Kissena Boulevard, and it is possible to find free parking along the side streets.\",\n",

You have to be in this mindset that you're going to your really annoying and condescending aunt's house for dinner. This is the kind of aunt that will tell you that you gained weight and you probably shouldn't eat that. Your aunt knows better than you. You roll your eyes and get through dinner.

You can tell a lot of time and effort is put into the cooking and Mama Lee always looks out for her customers to ensure satisfaction.Some may argue that the price range is a tad expensive only because tip and service is built into the menu pricing. Overall, you are paying for flavorful food and the quality of service.For the reviews before me, I think it is a bit unfair to give such low ratings based on her business hours and rude attitude. Although, I understand that these are key elements in running a good business, sometimes you just have to wonder maybe that person might be going through something. She lost her main chef in recent months, so she is under a lot of pressure in running the restaurant alone with her husband.

Great location from the train and in a nice area of Astoria. The food, bar service and set up was spot on. All the guests had so much fun and their event planner (Kate) was helpful and had all the concerns and bases covered. During the entire event herself and the staff were on top of every detail.

I didn't explore too much, but the decor and size of the place were great. Surprisingly, it wasn't as busy as I expected it to be.Service was fine. Seems like this is the type of place where frequent patrons will be treated extra well, which I think is reasonable and good for business.Offerings are familiar and reasonably priced. For the date, we kept it to just drinks. None of the cocktails stood out to me, but that's all a matter of personal choice. I enjoyed a bell's two hearted ale.I was hoping to eat, but since we were keeping it to just cocktails, I pulled a fast one and doubled back after departing. I can't not order chicken and waffles when I see it on a menu. But here's where the disappointment set in. The waffle part of the chicken and waffles was lovely. The chicken part of it though was just some bland jumbo chicken finger. Like... what?! My heart sank. I was hella hungry and had been eager to come here for a while hearing that their food was awesome. They really hit me off with some jumbo chicken finger though. Worse was that it was bland bland. I had to throw a lot of hot sauce on it just assuage my sadness.It was a little frustrating to leave like that and tbh, it wouldn't be enough for me to give the Bonnie a 2-star review, but when I noticed that they're charging $7 for a Narragansett?! Come on, $7?! I'm not trying to cast aspersions on Narragansett, but it's half a step up from PBR. It's what you drink when you don't want to drink, but don't want water.I love the locale and the place; the people are nice and attentive.

I'll take wooden tables and floors to modern restaurants any day. Also, we have been fortunate to avoid the lines, but take it as a warning. By no means make Cafe Henri your Saturday brunch choice.

Right off the bat I was pretty impressed with their selection of food because I have never seen their dishes in other Japanese restaurants before. I wanted to try everything but of course, we wouldn't be able to finish it all. We ended up ordering Omu Soba, Miso Carbonara Udon, French Fries, Crispy Crab roll, and Takoyaki, and more. I was surprised by the french fries because they didn't taste like regular fries. They were so light and airy, I loved it. The fries came with ketchup and spicy mayo and those are the two condiments I would usually go for, so that was perfect. The takoyaki and crispy crab roll didn't have a unique taste to me, but they were still delicious and flavorful. The omu soba came out next and it was so large. The whole dish tasted so good! The soba and the egg were so flavorful. Unlike many restaurants, the pork slices weren't chunky; they were literally such thin slices. The miso carbonara uson tasted good too, but I personally felt like there was too much cheese to it. Overall, this place is great. Service was fine and the food was great. The prices are a little bit up there, but it would be a great place to go to once in a while. Definitely would want to return.\",\n",

When I walk into a restaurant and I\\'m the only white person there, it\\'s all people from the locale where said restaurant serves up cuisine from, I have a pretty good idea it\\'s the real deal. The former residents of those countries are eating here, not at the newest fusion restaurants with reclaimed wood tables and $12 cocktails when I can get a full meal for that price at places like this. I seem to really have it in for those places...Anyway, this restaurant is located next to a seafood restaurant, which in turn is located next to a big Asian supermarket, located a short walk from the Elmhurst Ave. station. It\\'s rather thin and deep, as usual, with walls of their dishes adorning one of the walls, presumably to help certain diners, be they \"white males pointing at the wall and asking repeatedly \\'wuzzat\\' or... others? Tables were... standard. Booth seats and chars, nothing fancy but nothing rickety. Cash only; no cards.I\\'ve had four dishes here. The Singapore Kari Laksa is my favorite thus far; noodle soup with shrimp, bean sprouts, egg, I think it had chicken, and coconut milk based broth. It was amazing. Now I want a bowl. The Hokkien Udang Mee was great as well, but not amazing like the Kari Laksa. Smorgasbord of items as usual, tomato-based broth so if you\\'re watching calories or something, try this. The Nasi Lemak was a tad on the small side, but peanuts, egg, mixed vegetables, I think fried chicken or goat curry, can\\'t remember, and rice, so a rich medley. The Hainanese chicken was... disappointing to me. Very mild, almost... boiled, in my opinion. If you like milder stuff and not stuff that will knock your socks off, like I do, give this a shot. I\\'ve seen people eating this all the time.So yeah, you don\\'t want General Tso\\'s chicken from the small cheap shops, which is as Chinese as a hot dog?

Also, you don't come here for the decor. Half the time, i order the Kari Laksa. Love the creamy curry broth this noodle dish comes in (topped with seafood). I always request them to substitute the noodles to the mai fun noodle (no extra charge). They also have a nice hot sauce that boosts the spicy level of this dish. Other dishes I've tried have all been very good.

Twice I've done take out. Last night, we decided to grab a quick bite on the way home. It was probably 5 p.m. and there may have been four tables seated, with three servers. Well, I'm not entirely sure the third person was a server, but I'll get to that in a moment.For the THIRD time we were seated in section of the female server. And, for the THIRD time she completely changed her demeanor when she came to our table and was noticeably \\xa0unfriendly. The minute we said we didn't drink, she excused herself and passed our table off to someone else. The first two times it was the shorter waiter with the goatee. In this case, it was to the person we assume is the back waiter. \\xa0What was interested was how friendly, funny, gregarious and personable she was with her other tables, including the one right next to us, where she laughed and joked, made suggestions about which dishes were good, and offered them coffee and dessert.But with us, not even a smile. It was dismissive and rude, and made us feel unwelcome, as if we didn't belong there. It dumbfounds me that we would be treated this way.It was even more annoying to see the owner, who I introduced myself to the night before when I stopped by to pick up take out, and even said hello to as we walked in, go around and interact with the three other tables but not us.So, at this point, I am very annoyed and just want to leave. But Jayson was exhausted and he didn't want to start doing restaurant hopping, so I begrudgingly stayed, for him. Instead of enjoying a full meal and having a relaxing dinner as we planned, we only ordered an appetizer and a pasta dish. Here's where it gets more unbelievable. They managed to cook and prepare our food and have it on the table LITERALLY in less than FIVE minutes! WTF? Seriously, we just ordered. I literally got up to wash my hands, and Jayson was texting me to say the food was there.Did we just get leftovers or someone else's food? From the taste of it, quite possibly. It was COLD STALE AND TASTELESS. Neither were fresh. If I wasn't so annoyed by all the other stuff, I would have sent it back. But I really just wanted to leave.They didn't even give us a chance to chill. I mean, the other night, it took 20 minutes to prepare my shrimp and pasta. But this time, our food was on our table in less than five minutes. Could they make us feel any less welcome?Not once did anyone come over to check on us or ask how things were.This once was our FAVORITE new spot. But what a difference a day makes.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Really expected this place to be great based on the 4 star rating with over 1,900 reviews plus the hype it was getting from friends that picked it....but it fell short. For starters, the beer I ordered was no longer being served (but was one of the 10 being advertised), the food took almost an hour to come out (the place was probably 1/4 filled. Not busy at all), AND when the food finally did come the order was wrong. So needless to say I was not too happy with the first impression. -Smoke House BBQ Burger: 3/5, it was alright. The burger itself was like any other burger with bbq sauce on it. I've gotten burgers before with pulled brisket or pork on top so I was excited thinking this was the same, it was not. Instead it was two slices of very mediocre brisket slapped on top of the burger. This was my mistake as I thought it would be pulled not sliced. -Beef Brisket: 2/5, honestly shocked at how underwhelming the brisket was here. Very dry, with not much flavor. -Mac & Cheese: 4/5, thankfully this was great and saved the meal. For $6 I had high hopes which were met by this side. Great flavor. Overall, had I gone into this place not knowing about all the hype and hearing everyone rave about it I would've thought it was just another BBQ joint. After eating here though I personally feel that I would not return. The food and the experience were both subpar and I've definitely had much better BBQ food at other spots. Still glad I gave this place a shot though.\",\n",

We visited after the dinner rush in a weeknight, and I noticed that our waitress had a friend come into the restaurant, which normally would not be anything to write about. However, after our waitress \"took\" our order (i.e. tried to memorise it), she then proceeded to have a lengthy conversation with her friend as she was putting our order into the register. So of course, our order came out wrong! She messed up our drink order, forgot to add the extra honey butter for our cornbread, completely forgot an entire entree, and put in the wrong order for ribs. She was completely unapologetic about it, and even had a bad attitude when we pointed out what was missing.Oh, and these ribs... apparently the \"Fall of the Bone\" St. Louis-style ribs are nothing more than the dry-rub ribs with BBQ sauce poured on top. Anyone with an inkling of barbecue knowledge knows that St. Louis-style ribs are supposed to be finished on the grill with sauce, and not just have the sauce simply poured on the top afterwards. And they certainly were not falling off the bone at all!Horrible waitress and bad bbq ribs. At least the mac & cheese and garlic broccoli were decent - hence 2 stars...'},\n",

The wait is definitely longer at the LIC one because it's smaller so if you have the choice I would go to the Forest Hills one. We got the curry ramen and our server was really great about telling us exactly what was in it e.g. pork in case we didn't eat it. The noodles have the perfect texture and the broth is flavorful and very hot. The cabbage, onions and broccoli add a great crunch. Alcohol wise they have an array of Sakes, Soju and for beer I only saw Sapporo (no wine or cocktails). Service was prompt, it's family friendly (they provide high chairs but ask that you leave your stroller by the entry because it's a small space), and they give you an 8% discount if you pay in cash.\",\n",

We were seated quickly and served quickly as well. Too quickly, I had just started on my takoyaki appetizer when they brought the Ramen out. I felt incredibly rushed while I decided if I wanted to let my Ramen get cold or that my takoyaki get cold. It's not that the waiter was rushing us or anything but the timing of the food coming out the kitchen was not expedited effectively. The ramen was good but nothing to write home about. The broth was not deep and rich as it should be, and the menma was over-cooked and had lost its crunch (unfortunate as this is one of my favorite toppings). However, egg was properly cooked, The noodles were perfectly done, and it was a good ratio of noodles to broth. The Gyu-don was a good portion for its price but once again, nothing to write home about. It tasted exactly like bulgogi over rice which is probably exactly what they were going for. So if you're eating with someone who doesn't like ramen or anything fishy, this might be a good choice along with the spicy pork. (This looked good on the menu, we didn't order it) Now for the good part, the Tako-wasabi was delicious, the Takoyaki had the perfect texture (and plentiful with Bonito flakes), and the Ebi-potato had a great, crunchy texture. And last but not least, their pricing was incredibly reasonable. Three tapas, two entrees, and tip totaled $44. If it weren't for the fact that the waiter did not once come back and ask us if we needed anything except when they wanted to wrap it up, I might've given four stars. I'll definitely be back...but not for the ramen. The broth is just not comparable to the other broths that are out there.\",\n",

There was so much cabbage in the broth to start, which was different and not good. The bamboo shoots in the bowl were putrid. I don't know if they were spoiled or what, but they were disgusting. Even the noodles had a weird taste. The worst was the broth, which I had an issue finding under all the salt they used. It was like licking a salt lick. It was inedible and I had to throw it out.

Definitely not five stars. And, definitely not the best ramen we\\'ve had, as we thought the first time.Then came the third time. I decided to do take out. And, this time around, I added in fried calamari. One, the soup bordered on retched. Second, the calamari was probaby in the top five of the worst I\\'ve ever had.

The woman who answered only kept saying, \"you want to order.\" I\\'d say no, \"I just got really bad food.\" \"You want to order.\" So, I wrote an email, which never got a response.Still, I chalked it up to maybe it wasn\\'t the kind of food to get on take out.

We ordered cheung fun, scallion pancake, beef brisket curry over rice, beef brisket noodle soup, and clay pot rice.The cheung fun is good, but it is a little bit too chewy for my liking. I tend to like cheung fun best when it's freshly steamed and the rice noodle is almost able to unfold itself. The scallion pancake, however, is another story. It is barely a scallion pancake, and you can tell that it has been frozen and microwaved because it was overly buttery and soggy. If you order it expecting a crispy, flaky scallion pancake, you will be disappointed. That being said, if you eat it like roti, it is PERFECT dipped into the beef brisket curry. The beef brisket curry over rice was delicious -- easily my favorite thing we ordered. It's a bit spicy and sooo beautifully flavored. The beef brisket was wonderfully tender, too.The spare rib clay pot rice is pretty standard, not much to say about it. The spare ribs are pretty good and were somehow on the border of sweet and savory.The beef noodle soup is also good, and the beef is perfectly tender.One thing I will say is that the serving sizes here are smaller than your average Cantonese restaurant.

Now I wish I was paying attention to the convo but I surely was not. I would have told him not to order the sea bass and to stick with his first choice. When they brought out his entree he was a bit in shock so I said just try it. He tried it and was pulling scales from his mouth. I wanted him to send it back but he felt bad. Not as bad as me!!! This was his birthday dinner and he was upset and so was I. They really should take that entree off the menu and replace it with grouper or a sea bass fillet. Plus they fill your cup up with mostly ice and charge you $2.75 for a seltzer and then guess what? Your still thirsty and ask for more and another charge. Not impressed.'},\n",

Eggs had a nice mixture of cheese and ham inside, made better with some hot sauce. Salad had a mild vinaigrette on top that was pretty good. Bloody Mary wasn't too strong, as it didn't detract from the main course.

While the portion is small it is sufficient for 2-3 people to share and have just a taste. There were four different items on the tray: 2 pieces spring rolls, 4 chive pancakes, 2 steamed chicken and shrimp dumplings (siu mai) and 3 fried crab dumplings. Two sauces were provided as well. I thought the appetizers were just okay. - Chiang Mai Curry Noodle Soup: Strong, tasty broth with a nice kick. The one chicken leg was very tender. Nice contrast with the fried egg noodles with the soft. It is a well executed dish but nothing special. - Bangkok Crab Meat Noodles: This can be ordered dry or with soup. We ordered it with soup on the side so we can have best of both worlds. I noticed some reviews say this is bland but I happen to love the subtlety of this dish.

My first couple experiences here were great! The food tasted fresh and the staff was so friendly and outgoing and that\\'s what I normally look for in a restaurant. I would always go in and have the skirt steak dish and my fiancé would have the Lomo slatado.WHEN IT STOPPED BEING A GOOD EXPERIENCE So I would say about my 5th time here things weren\\'t as good. At this point my fiancé and I had a routine where we would order our favorite dishes. This time the meal was Okay, it didn\\'t taste as as good for some reason not sure why we just remembered we weren\\'t as satisfied. We just wrote off this experience because we know that every restaurant has its bad days. We would continue returning and the experience just kept getting worst, the food wasn\\'t as good and the staff weren\\'t as friendly. I have a 3 strike system where after 3 strikes I just never come back and don\\'t recommend the place.THE 3RD STRIKE AND MY LAST NIGHT AT BLENDBack in May, my fiancé decided to bring me here for my birthday because she know I love frozen sangrias. I was a little skeptical at first because the last couple of times but they hadn\\'t received my last strike so I agreed. We were served by the server that took our table the last four times. He isn\\'t very social and kinda just walks up to your table to take your order and that\\'s it. That made the experience less enjoyable. So we went on and did our routine and order our normal dishes. The chicharones de pollo had a weird flavor this time, I couldn\\'t put my finger on it. It just didn\\'t taste right. Next came out our Lomo Saltado which came out pretty cold, i remember taking my first bite and the steak was pretty cold almost as if they just defrost it. The dish wasn\\'t hot at all and the steak tasted old. It was just gross and I couldn\\'t being myself to eat the whole dish. Next my fiancé ordered the chocolate cake with a birthday candle which was supposed to come warm, but it wasn\\'t. The server literally grabbed the plate and plopped it right in front of me, didn\\'t say \"happy birthday\", didn\\'t play a birthday song and just walked away. It was the worst birthday dinner I\\'ve ever had in my life!!!My fiancé and I own a restaurant by the way so we always leave a good tip because we know server struggles. I\\'ve brought my family here so many time so the fact that they can\\'t even remember who you are is sad. This place lost my business, my respect, and my recommendations.

Tender pork is nestled in a pile of noodles and broth.Order at the window, get a number And find a table if you're lucky.\",\n",

The flavors blended so well together that it's an explosion in your mouth. No joke. Mussels were also a delight! Their ramen is definitely interesting since I am not use to udon like noodles for ramen. This was their choice of noodle in the spicy miso ramen.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Tonight was my last night of a 2800 mile culinary road trip, and being in NYC I need to cross off Mu Ramen on the ramen list! I got sucked into this location with its eclectic and at times over the top menu choices such as fois gras stuffed chicken wings, uni dish and wagyu beef hand rolls.We were a four top which allowed a wide range of dishes at the table.I asked not to be rushed and specifically requested that our waitress hold off firing our mains until we had finished all of our apps ( we had many in front of us ) which she agreed to do and and made a point of telling us that it was not a problem! I should of simply ordered our apps to insure we would not be bombarded with 12 covers at the table but that just what happened and it really was infuriating.The dishes were the savior of the meal: our U & I uni dish was delicate fresh and brine and paired well with the roe it came with, our OKONOMIYAKI scallion pancake was a riff on blinis and caviar in its presentation but the flavor profile was subtle and flavorful, our dry aged wagyu ribeye hand rolls were deconstructed in presentation and the tartare missed the mark in flavor and texture, and finally our stuffed chicken wings stuffed with fois gras and brioche, well this one was my biggest disappointment as one could easily say it had more brioche then fois. The fry batter was pedestrian at best no color or seasoning! The wings were cooked perfectly tender. They were large full wings but we were hard pressed to find the fois which appeared to be sparingly placed under the skin rather than truly stuffed. They could of done a better job on those. They sounded grand but I would hold on to your $ on that one. \\xa0 Our 3 ramens broths ( Tonkotsu, 2 spicy miso ) were on point. Each bowl was creamy, had depth of flavor and was presented well, I was taken a back to see that udon noodles were used in the spicy miso and soba were used in the Tonkotsu?? Since no description was made on the menu, I would've like to have known that!CONCLUSION:Location was easy to find, reservations secured a good table, very small venue, noise level was moderate, staff was fair at best. Food was fair to good at times. One visit was enough after getting sucked into the hype.\",\n",

Considering that the place is called 'Mu Ramen,' I deemed it most appropriate to try its ramen, though they seem to be popular for their $19 burger (because having an overpriced burger somehow instantaneously makes restaurants relevant these days). The spicy miso ramen's pork-based broth was entirely undetectable, but not so much as was the flavor of miso. While it was sufficiently spicy, the flavor of a tonkotsu broth was entirely absent, as was even the umami bomb offered by so many superior ramen joints in the area.Upon receiving the bill for my $19 bowl of spicy miso ramen, for which I did not request any add-ons or toppings, I was charged an additional $2.50 for the egg. This brought the total to $21.50 before tax and tip. Before I knew it, I had just paid $25 for a bowl of mediocre ramen, and to top it all off - they don't take card! I was hastily pointed to an ATM in the corner of the restaurant to cover this straight-up exorbitant bill.Save yourself the money and trouble - opt for a comparably flavorful meal at the deli/grocery next door. They sell Nongshim microwave ramen for $1.50.\",\n",

Warning: maybe the most expensive thing on the menu (MP).Other than that:(I forget what this was called on the menu) fried chicken leg - D (too salty and greasy, not worth $8)Tonkotsu ramen - A- (Pork was thick and juicy; egg was just slightly more raw than normal, which I didn't enjoy)PS this place is CASH ONLY!

I first discovered them on Yelp in 2016, I have since then become a frequent diner and try to make an appearance at least 2-3 times a month because it is just too damn good! It is right in the center of Station Square in Forest Hills so it is conveniently located next to the LIRR and a quick, 2 block walk from the E,F,R,M subway lines.The space itself is small but they make the most with what they have to work with. They have a full bar area with some high-tops in the front, with more tables towards the back of the restaurant for people looking to sit down and eat. In the Summer months, they have 4-5 tables outside which makes for a fantastic dining experience. The restaurant is typically always crowded, which sometimes requires a wait because they don't take reservations. When there are concerts going on at Forest Hills Stadium this place is THE SPOT to pre and post-game at. They will sometimes set up fencing to create a kind of 'beer garden'-esque area out front to provide more room for standing.They do not offer happy hour but drinks are reasonably priced for the area and always pack a punch. They make a delicious red and white sangria daily, which seems to be a fan favorite amongst diners. All there beer is bottled and they offer a great selection of different domestic and craft beers.In regards to the food, everything is ALWAYS delicious and made fresh. They are known for their mussels. Best described as a huge portion of shellfish that comes out piping hot in a white wine broth (I eat it with a spoon because it's so good!) and served alongside a heaping basket of freshly made bread. With all of that being said, the real shining star at Dirty's is the incredible waitstaff and the consistency of the food and overall experience. The waitresses are all fantastic and make you feel like family. Jess, Melissa, Pam, Raquel are all incredible in every way. If you are ever in Forest Hills, this is the place to go.

My heart was set on the shrimp quesadilla, but I found it strange that it didn't come with your standard salsa and sour cream. Instead it came remoulade. The quesadilla was delicious. The shrimp was fresh and lightly seasoned, but the three cheese blend with the sautéed peppers and onions stole the show. I asked for sour cream and sliced avocado which was an upcharge. My hunny ordered the mussels which seems like a staple at DP. Every other table had a big bowl of it.

The waiting space is really cramped and there are lots of customers/waiters walking in and out of the narrow aisle we were sitting at and I felt extremely uncomfortable sitting there and people brushing against my leg while passing through. Almost an hour later, we had to ask again when we were getting seated and they said it's looking like another 20mins...and we were like ok. We weren't seated until past 9 and they said 45mins when we came at 7:30. That's double the time they told us...also most of the people that came in after us got seated first. I rather them overestimate than underestimate the time. We also ordered beer to drink while we waited but the waitress asked if we can pay on the spot three times and we said no, because we didn't eat yet and she can just put it on the bill. She got frustrated with us and threw the menu on my lap as she was walking away...Then she returned with coronas and handed it to us without even opening the caps...these aren't twistoffs. We were definitely not happy with her attitude especially since we have been waiting so long. The broth was good but honestly not better than its competitors. The food was so expensive...$13 for 6pc of fish balls, $4 for 3pc of chopped up corn, $5 for 4pc of fish tofu...overpriced for no reason. The bill was $150 for 3 ppl for so little food.

All the dishes have their own personalities and they taste amazing.Recommended: Bulgogi QuesadillaTtuk BokkiTruffle FriesI love the ambiance of dimmed lights where everyone look so beautiful. I also saw that the high tables are made with convenient storage (beneath the table) where you can really relax without worrying that someone is stealing stuff from your purse. Usually it\\'s irritating (and difficult) to keep an eye on your purse sitting on the side of your table/chair while you\\'re getting drunk. And hands down to the servers for maintaining such service with bottomless cups for the evening (with our consent of course). The service is amazing, they all seemingly have many years of experience at hand. I highly recommended to everyone and anyone to spend their Friday/Saturday nights at The Coop.',\n",

Including a matcha mojito and ice coffee.The pork in tomato sauce was very salty and sweet, but the pork was well cooked. The snow salmon was well present but the amount is tiny. Most of it was croutons, dressing and 25% was the actual salmon. The roasted duck wedge salad was quite tasty but again too salty. Mostly romaine salad. About 85% and the roasted duck was chopped into tiny pieces and fried. The texture was like \"rousong\" which is dried shredded pork. The matcha mojito was served in a martini glass. No straw or anything to accompany it with. The only thing I tasted was the vodka and matcha. They probably only put a single teaspoon of almond milk. I did not taste any honey at all. Perhaps they forgot. There was a tiny bit of cinnamon powder and a johnny jump up flower which is edible. The cinnamon powder was a poor choice. It is an expensive if not overpriced drink at $14. I only drink about 10%. Overall, the food was average and too salty. The presentations are good effort. The staffs are polite. The oysters is probably the only plate I enjoyed because it was not processed nor tampered with too much.',\n",

My party and I got the Shogun deal and added beef tongue. It was super filling for the 5 of us, with all the appetizers and the delicious meats. They also change the grill often so that you don't get burnt meat. You get to grill your own meats to your preference but the staff also gives you a recommended time to grill each item.

If you're wondering why there was still happy hour at 8:30 PM on a Thursday, it's okay because I was wondering the same thing.

Reservations are definitely needed during peak times, as your wait time can easily hit over an hour. And with many tables cooking their own food, it's hard to truly gauge how long you'll be waiting.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': \"I have been to many different Gyu-Kaku locations, and not just the ones in the city. I have even been to Gyu-Kaku overseas, in Taiwan, so I am definitely not new on the concept and have a pretty well rounded idea on how they operate. I made reservations for 7:15pm on a weekday and when I arrived there was no hostess. I waited for 5 minutes and decided to walk upstairs. The bartender saw my friend & I walk up and we obviously looked lost and he just proceeded to stand there. After 5 minutes, an employee approached us and I said I have reservations and gave her my name. She said she will be back and walked downstairs. When she came back up, she told me friend they don't allow outside drinks (she had a Starbucks drink) and I told her don't worry we will order cocktails but she still said my friend had to toss it. I understand not allowing outside food/drinks but if someone was going to order drinks, I would allow it (but whatever I don't own the place). So we sat down and the server greets us, I didn't understand what she said but she said it in a polite manner. We decided to order the AYCE Ultimate package which seemed like a good deal. It's actually a good deal for the restaurant bc I don't eat meat so I ordered the cheapest items. The apps came in a timely manner and then the meats came. Now this place is a bit sneaky, they don't serve you all the meat selections. Halfway thru our grilling, my friend said the shrimp and salmon wasn't served. No one came to check on us so we couldn't ask. The AYCE option says you have 90 minutes to order your food and after that you are cut off from ordering. At the almost 90 minute point, the server finally re-emerges and said our 90 minute ordering time is almost up and if we want anything else. I said we never got the seafood and she said b/c we ordered a lot, she didn't bring it out bc she thought we wouldn't want it (in other words they are cheap, they withhold your food hoping you won't remember) and then she asked if we wanted anything else. I said I'll take the s'mores dessert. Not even 5 minutes later, a woman who identified herself as the manager came and said she has another reservation waiting downstairs for a table and it's a big group so they need my table and the table next to us. She said because we been there since 7:15pm and it was almost 8:40 pm (even though there was 2 other tables that were there before we even got there that could both seat 10). Now Korean or Japanese BBQ isn't a meal you eat on the run, people need time. Especially if you are doing the cooking yourself. She even admitted the server failed to tell us she needed the table back at 8:50pm. I said fine give me the check bc quite frankly, the drinks sucked and the food was mediocre. The manager then had the nerve to scold me and said she will charge me next time for unfinished food. She asked me to leave before I was done, before I got the rest of my order, before I got my dessert and then threatened to charge me for un-finished food. Does that make sense? I don't even like to waste food so I would never intentionally over order but I wasn't going to eat every last crumb even if we weren't asked to leave our table early. I told her that's ridiculous and if she expected me to lick the plate. I'm not sure if there was a language barrier bc her English was poor but I found that whole lecture was absurd especially since you are asking me to leave before I finished eating because you didn't seat reservations accordingly. This location never changes the grill either, the entire time we were there it was only changed once bc I asked a male server if he could bc everything was burning. And even though the Mango Mai Thai & Geisha sucked, I was thirsty but no one ever came and asked if I wanted another drink. The bathroom downstairs also reeks of urine and is disgusting, even for Flushing standards. For $160, I expect the restaurant to let me finish my meal and for the manager to be competent. This location is going to give the rest a bad rep!\",\n",

Waiters kept wasting my time during the whole dinner. Every time I wanted to order more meats or added some water or changed a plate or something, I hardly could find my waiter. Did they just wanted to reduce the times of services so that I could leave as soon as possible? Is it because I came in at 9:25 pm and they knew that I am having a time-limited buffet, so waiter felt upset or something? They really did not care about how the customers feel. They even would not ask you if you want to change your plate or add some water or something unless you ask them by yourself. Moreover, I kept asking them to give me a white rice at least three times, but they still didn't give me. Even when I asked them to give me the check, they still waste my half hour to get it. Why did they need half hour to get a check? How hard it was? And in the end, some of the meats were really not fresh but they still forced me to eat the steak otherwise they would require me to pay this.What a ridiculous restaurant, 100% I will not come again.\"},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"My family and I came on a late Saturday night and the place was still packed! We were greeted and seated immediately. The restaurant is located on a main road and there is a small parking lot right in front that they share with a few other businesses in that strip. Because we came late, we were able to find parking quickly. For a table a 6, we ordered a few main courses to share. We started with the live squid and the seafood pancake. For the main dishes, we ordered the kalbi, the empire spicy seafood pot, and the budae jigae. Although a little scared, the live squid was delicious and super fun to eat. I was terrified of it getting stuck in my throat, but it was delicious and the perfect texture. The kalbi was flavorful - my dad devoured the dish within minutes! I wasn't a big fan of the budae jigae, I've definitely had better. Besides the spiciness, you couldn't really taste any other flavors, which was disappointing. And here comes the highlight of the dinner - the empire spicy seafood pot! This is the most famous dish of the restaurant, just a big pot of seafood and veggies and udon noodles with amazing flavor. My mom is allergic to all soy products, so we asked to make sure to exclude tofu and bean sprouts. As we started digging into the big pot, we discovered a big handful of bean sprouts, and by now, my mom has already started reacting to it. We spoke to the server and they were very apologetic. They brought out a whole new pot, despite the fact that we have already eaten a few clams and shrimps. The chef even came out to apologize. My poor mother was suffering but they were apologizing profusely that she actually felt bad. If it wasn't for the bean sprouts, the pot was my mom's favorite dish, that says a lot!Overall, it was a great experience, hope they're more careful next time! Food allergies are scary and unpredictable.\",\n",

The seating area is moderately sized and decorated with wooden tables, like most pubs in K-town. We made a reservation, but on a Friday it was rather empty. We ordered the live octopus ($30) and it was what you expected it to be; slimy but an experience you want to try out. They give 2 sauces to dip it in. The aftertaste was unpleasant - it tasted like dead salty fish. I had a few pieces and was over it. We also got the famous seafood hot pot. It smelled delicious, I was drooling! There was a generous portion of shrimp, mussels, a few lobster legs. However, at $100+ this was a let down as the broth was extremely bland. It lacked seasoning, so the fish itself tasted uncooked and bland as a result. For a dinner that cost $150+, the food was not good at all and lacked flavor. However, our waiter was very friendly and attentive so I feel obliged to give them 2 stars for staff services. 3/10, would not recommend.',\n",

We are apart of 5 sitting in a corner booth that was both cramped and too warm sitting right in front of the bathroom and entry way to kitchen. Food was very salty and seafood wasn't fresh. The pot had a lot of fillers such as bean sprouts, cabbage and rice cakes. Some clams didn't open even when left on the pot cooking for over 30 mins. There were a lot of small mussels, 3 shrimps, half of a crab and a 1 lb lobster. We all nibbled at it. Clearly wasn't nearly anything like the northern Blvd branch.

After going through the menu we ordered half fried chicken, crispy knuckles, pork belly appetizer \\xa0pork chops and one mango drink and another drink similar to lemon.

The citrus \\xa0drink was fantastic as well, I can't describe the flavor but there was a depth and complexity to it that I liked.The pork belly appetizer was served with a raw egg but it cooked quickly on the sizzling cast iron plate it was brought out on. This dish was very good. Next we tried the fried chicken overall it was tasty very simple but tasty. The pork chop had great charred flavor and paired nicely with the rice. Again nothing spectacular it just right. The crispy knuckle I didn't even get to try because I was so full from the other dishes.

They served great silog dishes, a type of Filipino breakfast, for such an affordable price. So happy that Tito Rad's was able to deliver on the quality, and it's become my go-to silog spot now. Both the tapsilog (cured beef) and tocilog (cured pork) were excellent, as was the longsilog (with longganisa, Filipino cured sausage). The garlic rice was tasty and intensely garlicky, just the way I like it, and I loved those slivers of pickled veggies as well.Aside from the silog dishes, I had the adobong baboy (pork adobo) and sinigang with belly bangus (sour tamarind soup with veggies and milkfish belly). The adobong baboy was not as strong and vinegary like some of the ones I've had, but it was very comforting and flavorful. I also enjoyed the little I had of the spicy and sour sinigang, but I had a sore throat at the time so I couldn't really enjoy it. I brought the rest back for my mom and she seemed to like it.One thing, though: They either don't serve ube ice cream with their halo halo, or they didn't offer it to us, because our halo halo came with vanilla ice cream.

I was pleasantly surprised with just how delicious and well thought out every dish was. Let me start with the vegan truffle mac and cheese. There are A LOT of ways to mess up mac and cheese: the cheese can be too thick/thin, the breadcrumbs could be soggy or flavorless, the pasta can be overdone to the point of mush, and in this case they can put way too much truffle oil. No5 made the mac and cheese perfectly! This is so difficult to do but I seriously had no complaints. The pasta was cooked just the right amount, the truffle oil wasn't overpowering, the cheese was the best tasting vegan one I've had in a while, the breadcrumbs were crispy, and the mushrooms were fresh. I loved the fresh greens on top too! I also tried the sweet potato and quinoa cakes as an appetizer. While I wish they were crispier on the outside, the flavor was great and I loved the blackberry/blueberry topping with vegan parmesan. The fresh beets were a welcome addition as well. For dinner, I got their seiten wrap with fries. You think fries are as basic as you can get but wrong--these were on point! The seiten was wonderfully juicy and the fillings were fresh. The only thing I regretted was the wrap and sauce. The menu did not say anything about this being spicy but the wrap and mayo were chipotle based. You shouldn't \\xa0surprise someone with this. The vegan dessert was delicious as well and the service was great. Our waitress checked on us frequently even just from afar to make sure she timed all the dishes nicely. The owner was a bit flustered when I first came and said how I may have to wait a long time for food. First of all, you should not be persuading people to leave.

Both came in large portions and were super filling. I didn't particularly enjoy the popcorn chicken as much because I thought it was more batter then chicken itself. It was still tasty though. The fried tofu was a bit tasteless, most probably because I didn't get any seasoning on it.So my second time around, I ordered the chicken pops (again), garlic string beans, and fried turnip cake all in Medium seasoning and black lemon pepper. With my Yelp check in, I also got to redeem the Venetian Tofu (they ran out of the bouncing curds). The wait time was about ten minutes. This time around the food was so delicious! I shared with my brother and we both could not finish. The medium spice really added a kick to it this time. Out of everything i ordered, my favorite was actually the fried turnip cakes. \\xa0Now I'm very eager to try the taro and blood rice cakes next. Also the chicken or leg cutlet since I want more meat.

Spicy.I was in the area and this was a place I had wanted to try for awhile. While you do wait a bit for your food, that's because everything is made fresh to order. Good portion sizes too.We got the Legend Pops, asked for spicy - very tasty. There was a slight sweetness in the seasoning which I'm not sure of the exact ingredient. Regardless, it was enjoyable to eat. Crispy, they give you the skewers to pick up each piece. Lots of flavor in each bite. The chicken has the traditional tastes of garlic, ginger, five spice, etc.Wanted to have something else to accompany this but potatoes were a bit too filling as this was a midday snack. We opted for the garlic broccoli. It had the spice seasoning too but the florets got all crispy on the edges.

I love that they sprinkle plum powder on them which gives them this tart sweetness, which I love.The only thing is I feel like sometimes the spice might be a little overpowering, but go for mild and I think you'll be fine.Whenever I'm craving for some fried food, this is the place I want to go.\",\n",

The chicken was also fried with basil and the basil was salty.The bouncing curds which are basically cubes of fried tofu, had different spices added to the outer coating. I personally don't really like tofu, but sometimes if cooked well enough, I'd enjoy a bite or two.

It was next to the window so it was brightly lit, and I really liked the overall modern/rustic vibes of the restaurant. It was a busy but not overly crowded evening.We all checked in on Yelp for our free shot of Lychee Soju each. A couple of us ordered additional cocktails ($10/each), a bottle of Peach Soju ($14) and then a 1000ml pitcher of Mango Soju ($30) to share. We had mentioned to our waiter that we were here celebrating a birthday, so he actually served our complimentary soju shots in another pitcher (or beaker) and filled it up to the 1000ml line - which was almost double the amount of shots. SHOUTOUT to all this free alcohol! We truly appreciated it. So we basically had TWO full beakers of soju, for the price of one. Amazing!For appetizers, we ordered the Calamari ($17) and Truffle Fries ($10) - both standard but great sharing foods. (I personally could've done without all the fried foods lol) Then came out the famous WINGS. (We ordered them as soon as we sat down because they take a while to make, pro tip.) We got 3 large orders ($22.95/each with about 20 pieces per order) with 2 of them being all Soy Garlic and the last one Half & Half -- half Soy Garlic and half Spicy Soy Garlic. Birthday girl advised us that the Spicy ones are actually RLY spicy, which was why we only ordered a half batch of them. She was right. I had only one, and that was enough for me for the night... don't get me wrong, it was good but I didn't want to continuously feel like I was dying as I kept eating. The regular soy garlic ones were BOMB and lived up to the hype.

Having used to run along the Gantries, I'm still surprised I never knew it was there. It seems you'd have to crane your head from the corner where'd you stand near the Pepsi sign, just to try and catch a glimpse.For that reason, it makes a lovely secluded outdoor patio space if you wanted to through a private event, informal or formal. And supposedly worrying about noise levels isn't an issue either nor bringing pets because of the purely outdoor nature of this place (read: also means, come on a fair weather day).I lean on the 3.5 star spectrum of this review simply because I wasn't wowed by their dish of fame, the çevapi. I guess I was running a little protein deficient that day, cause I was craving a massive burger or something despite having already eaten a very healthy dinner at home. I ordered the Balkan sausage and just found it to lack oomph in flavor, which made me more liable to balk (!) at the near entree price I paid. Others around me seemed to like the dish, though, so perhaps I'm an outlier. Customer subjectivity is simply the forever curveball in the delicate balance of the good food-good setting-good value trifecta.

That should have been enough, but I got cocky and ordered the $5 side of Livers and Gizzards neglecting to realize we were getting some already (photo: bit.ly/3216yTD)The cumulative pile of innards was not greeted warmly by Jamie, but I was kinda excited and frankly indulged. The chicken itself was tender though slightly on the lukewarm side, and the Innards gratefully had the right texture and consistency.

While cheung fun is usually found at dim sum restaurants, we luckily have two dedicated rice noodle shops in Downtown Flushing, on the opposite sides of the Roosevelt Avenue and Main Street intersection - Fu Yuan and Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls. Of the two, I generally prefer Fu Yuan's rice noodle rolls. Our usual order from Fu Yuan or Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls -- sometimes both -- is the beef rice noodle roll (牛粉). Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls makes thinner, more delicate noodles; and uses minced meat, which allows the meat to be more evenly distributed though the noodle. Fu Yuan makes simpler, slightly thicker and greasier noodles similar in texture to dim sum restaurants; and uses actual meat pieces, though with a higher noodle-to-meat ratio. You won't go wrong with Fu Yuan or Joe's Steamed Rice Rolls, but for me, Fu Yuan makes for a heartier comfort snack. While Joe's separately packs sauces for take-out, Fu Yuan generally includes the sauces in the noodle container. I'd recommend soy sauce, some peanut sauce, and a dash of sriracha.Fu Yuan is take-out, only.

So you do get your food faster. I like it here more versus Joe's because it just seems more authentic. Cheap, delicious, and a classic.

The broth was silky with tiny beads a fat floating on the surface making for the perfect consistency to soothe my irritated throat and help improve my breathing. The noodles were perfect and all the ingredients very fresh. I enjoyed the Goi Chon Tom (Grilled Jumbo Shrimp Rolls in rice paper) and the peanut sauce that was served was not overly sweet as I find elsewhere and had a fantastic consistency almost like a pudding making it thick and clingy to the roll.

I tried to get something both my husband and I would enjoy. I got the blackberry cheese danish and the fresh apple beignet to take home. I was soooo full from my burger that I ate the pastries much later. I was taken back by how tasty they were! My husband favored the beignet so I let him have it.

Fluffy, no overbearing egg taste, whipped cream was not too sweet. Good overall.Merguez scrambled egg and cheese Crepe- took about 10-15 mins. Is it worth it? Debatable. Merguez seasoned and not greasy. Egg and cheese good, but crepe on dry side - lacking some type of sauce perhaps. Syrup helped.Iced chocolate - opposite of hot chocolate. Ice cold, not too watery/milky/chocolaty. Str8 Plain chocolate. No sugar / no salt - for sugary chocolate lovers or sea salt chocolate lovers , it'll leave you feeling it's lacking those components.Orange Soda - nothing special. on the less sweeter/more carbonated side.Chocolate chip brioche - looks dry, but actually really soft and savory in middle.

The portions are pretty small and but everything is prepared and sliced thinly so that it cooks quickly. They have a 1.5hr limit for busy times but doesn't seem to get enforced strictly.

I went to inquire if they give out numbers but they said not until noon. This was also when a middle-aged staff lady basically bum rushed my very pregnant self off to the side from behind and scurried into the kitchen/bathroom area. I was so shocked. Not to be a total jerk but it reminded me of the extremely rude behaviors I had come across in mainland China. No acknowledgement, no apologies. Even before they opened a good size crowd was beginning to form. The staff spoke mandarin and very minimal English but I believe they told me to scan the QR code to get a number... only they canceled my reservation scan out of nowhere and I had to do it again and of course ended up with a later number. It was very disorganized. The hostess was yelling out numbers in only mandarin to be seated and I told her a few times I don't understand and she would just nod me off. Mandarin-speaking customers with numbers after me would rush to the hostess and tell them their numbers and party size and would get seated before me - I know this because I at least kind of know my numbers one through ten in mandarin. I was furious. One customer noticed my frustration and did some translating for me. At least the restaurant is surprisingly HUGE so everyone gets seated rather quickly.Honestly after that hot mess of an introduction I didn't even want to be there. Luckily once we were seated the waiters and waitresses are MUCH better. More polite, helpful, and spoke English. The menus can be a little confusing as not everything had an English translation.This places charges $3 per person to use the sauce station. Can you believe that?! I've never seen that in my life. Horrid. Cheap. Unbelievable. The sauce station itself did not even have that many options. There weren't even basic things like sriracha nor sesame oil.The chicken skin skewer was gross as hell - I expected crispy skin with spices but it was cold rubbery skin with a hint of cooking wine and drizzled with chili oil. I wanted to barf but swallowed it because I was paying for that shit. We ordered a variety of items including taro, wagyu beef, fatty beef, fish ball with roe, chinese lettuce, A-choy, sole fish, fish tofu, Xiang noodles, enoki mushrooms, and more. Everything was pretty tasty but nonetheless standard hot pot food. We all agreed that the Xiang noodles was our favorite. The wagyu beef was kind of a waste for hot pot... very similar to the cheaper fatty beef if you're planning to dunk it in spicy broth anyway. I do not doubt their authenticity when it comes to their soup bases though. Bill came out to $180 for three adults and one toddler. We were stuffed but I will never come back again. I don't mind paying top dollar for good food but the service and lack of order that I experienced was just not okay. I don't appreciate having to act like fighting dogs in a ring trying to get seats because there's no civil order being followed. \\xa0Perhaps it'll be better if you visit during non peak hours. We went at opening time on a Saturday. I will say that when we finished lunch and left around 1:45pm, there were people waiting to get in. So perhaps a weekday?\",\n",

So the girl that works there said bring some back so I can show the chef and we'll get new ones ready for you. I thought that was the only right thing to do since it was a lot of money and they didn't want to refund us. We packed up almost ALL of the chicken into one tray and brought it back. So we got in the car, drove 20 minutes to get there for the Chef to come out and verbally attack my mom. Because we didn't have it in 3 separate trays? And that it wasn't the exact piece number that was given. So I guess he wanted us to take out of the garbage the raw meat we had all spit out? I was so appalled and quite frankly pissed off that any man thinks he has the right to speak to a woman in that way. He started screaming in Turkish and wouldn't speak English. He was mad we brought back raw chicken?! He said don't come back here anymore. How about you do your job & actually cook the chicken. We even then offered and said forget it we don't want more food just refund us, that's a lot of money for something you can't eat. And they refused. When I asked the girl if the chef was the owner she was very reluctant to answer, until I asked for the 3rd time and she said no he wasn't. Disgusting attitude for his own mistake. If he's not the owner I truly hope the owner comes across this review to see the way his/her chef conducts business. The first picture is from the first order and the second picture is what we went back for. More raw chicken. Sorry but you can get sick from eating raw chicken, & for that much money, it's incredible how they let the chef conduct himself that way.\",\n",

Located in the heart of Korean Queens, we found reasonably priced food cooked as if it were homemade. The restaurant is on Northern Boulevard and isn't hard to find with the big red awning outside. The restaurant itself isn't that big, but can seat perhaps 20 patrons. The menu is a simple two-sided menu with lots of common Korean dishes such as kimbap, pancakes, soups, rice dishes etc. We ordered a squid hot pot, a seafood pancake, a pork hot pot and a bibimbap. We were provided with 5 side dishes. Generally, the food tasted homemade.This is not a bad thing as the food seems unrushed and authentic. I felt the best of best of the bunch was the seafood pancake, then the two hot pots. The pancake was unusually crispy which I really enjoyed. The casseroles were not overly salty. The bibimbap which was served in a stone bowl could have been hotter. Unfortunately it wasn't hot enough to crisp the rice, however the ingredients inside were just fine. One of the best things about Gossip House's menu is there are many items between $6 to $9 and very few items over $12. You can really have an economical meal here without breaking the bank.As for the service, it was excellent as the waiters were attentive in filling water and taking orders. On one final note, we llked the interior of the restaurant because it was well-lit and had a friendly vibe to it. The jazz music in the background didn't hurt!

Named for, and inspired by, \\xa0Indian spiritual teacher, poet and composer Sri Chinmoy, it's a very peaceful place, echoing Chinmoy's well-known mediation practice. The decor and the clothing of the staff clearly take inspiration from Chinmoy's belief that peace could be manifested through silent meditation, music, poetry and art.While it prides itself as being a vegan/vegetarian restaurant, for those of us who want to turn and run when we hear either of those two words, it was easy to forget that's the staple here. They offer a wide variety of dishes, and a little taste of something for everyone. Honestly I only learned it was a vegan restaurant after we left, that's how good the food is.I ordered the Mediterranean omelette, with a third egg. It comes with sun-dried tomatoes, olives, onions and goat cheese, and it's served with a small side salad.It was delicious. Like, OMG melt in your mouth good. I wasn't crazy about the dressing for the salad, so I asked for the (vegan) blue cheese. But, the original dressing spilled over on my plate towards the end, and it would seem it wasn't as bland and blah as I originally thought. The good parts had just sunk to the bottom. But it was weird still.Jayson ordered the red velvet coffee and an Acai Super Hero Bowl with banana, blueberries, cashew milk, raw cocoa, mocha, chia seeds and topped with granola, chocolate nibs and strawberries.That was right up his watching his weight alley. He loved it. And it was so pretty too. He called it one of the best Acai bowls he's had.He didn't love the coffee, which is a shame, cause he's a man who loves good coffee.

       "  'Negative Review 1': 'There is NOTHING zen about Panorama of My Silence-Heart. Do NOT let the costumes or art work and photos of \\xa0Sri Chinmoy fool you. This is a business. And they most certainly do not follow Chinmoy\\'s path or existence, not common sense and good business practices.This was our second (and last) time ever coming here, which is really disappointing because I had high hopes that we discovered a new gem for grabbing breakfast or working peacefully while enjoying an acai bowl.Where to start. There are so many places.When we arrived Sunday morning, the place was pretty much empty, sans for a table that was finishing up at the front. There were three on staff, though not particularly eager to get to the counter, which was fine. I wanted time to decide. I ordered the BBB acai bowl and three eggs on the side. Seemed easy enough.Jayson, my husband, ordered oatmeal with coconut and fresh fruit, and tea. \\xa0I\\'m not sure what went wrong, but what I got was over-cooked, tasteless and slightly browned eggs that looked like they were made in a fryer or waffle iron. They were not edible. BUT, I took two bites, tried to doctor it with salt and pepper and then let it go. This was the first Sunday in a long time we both had off, and I didn\\'t want to get it off to the wrong start. No biggie (well, had it ended there.)There may have been two people that came in after us, neither of which ordered anything complex or particularly difficult. I believe one was just a coffee or a tea.Anyway, for reason unknown, it took 22 minutes to get him his oat meal. I\\'m not sure where the coconut flavor was, but what they gave him tasted like sewer water. Literally. After tasting it, he politely went up to the woman at the counter and said that it had a vile taste and that he\\'s like something else instead. It was not tasting right.Most places -- any place really -- would have said, no problem and simply replaced the dish. No harm, no fowl. But, she said no. It\\'s their policy that once a customer has it, they can not return it.What? It\\'s not his fault it was inedible and tasted like sewer water on a bad day. She refused and just smiled. He returned to the table very upset. It wasn\\'t about the money, it was about the principal. Not to mention, we came there to eat something. So, she called the manager on the phone for him to speak to.The manager did NOT asking him what was wrong with it, why he didn\\'t want it, how much he\\'d eaten (two small tea spoon full) or anything. She simply said that restaurants don\\'t do that -- um, my husband has worked in two top Times Square restaurants as a server for the last 4 years, so that\\'s 100% not true. She then said that once a customer tastes it, they can\\'t. How can a diner find out the food is spoiled, rancid or just nasty tasting if they don\\'t taste it and where is the accountability of the restaurant. She should Google that. Because I did, and most restaurants will automatically offer a guest another dish, especially if there\\'s a problem with the taste or quality, rather than lose a customer. And we are talking about oatmeal, not filet Mignon. And, there was no way that point that I could even try to enjoy or find out if my acai bowl was decent, given that I was served NASTY and BURNT eggs that were made in some contraption, which I did not mention or make an issue of ... or after he waited 20 minutes (when there were no other orders or anyone here before us) to get sewer tasting oatmeal with no coconut flavor.Not only was this just bad restauranting ... it\\'s just a lack of good business. What manager doesn\\'t ask what the problem is and try to find a solution? Apparently, this manager never practiced or read up on \\xa0Sri Chinmoy\\'s legacy or listen to his teachings because he would not be happy that she didn\\'t even bother to simply inquire about the situation. She make a business decision (if you can call it that) without knowing a single fact (and no, the woman behind the counter didn\\'t explain anything to her about the situation, she just dialed and handed him the phone). That\\'s NOT a manager. That\\'s literally someone phoning in work and not doing their job.This is a horribly bad place, with HORRIBLE service (even before this incident, the service was lacking severely) ... like when we walked in, the woman behind the counter was sitting at a table and couldn\\'t be bothered to get up to do her job. She took her \"zen\" time to get there. The food is HORRIBLE.The only reason they even got the one star is because Yelp doesn\\'t allow for none. Just look away and count your blessings that you chose elsewhere.And read up on \\xa0Sri Chinmoy, his teachings are amazing. It\\'s sad to see his legacy tarnished in such a way.',\n",

Pork intestines (ask for the crispy ones) and shrimp in the salted duck egg yolk.I've been coming to Szechuan Mountain House since they opened, before they got their second space started in Manhattan. I really like the interior design here and all over their dinnerware.If you're new to Szechuan, I'd recommend you inquire about the spiciness on the dishes. We have our ordering down to a system but here's what we usually order.Sliced beef and lamb tripe. If you're into offal cuts, this is a classic Szechuan dish. Thin slices of beef and lamb in a chili oil, this is served chilled. Super flavorful.Double-cooked pork. You can get this at a lot of restaurants but I like the flavor here, it's served with a lot of leeks which I love.Shrimp in salted duck egg yolk. Now, this is probably not great for you but that's why it tastes so good. The shrimp is stir-fried in the egg yolk which gives it this grainy texture. There's so much flavor in every bite. Wifey doesn't even like shrimp and always wants this.Pork intestines. Another offal dish but if you're adventurous, give this a try. The intestines are cut in small pieces and fried to a crisp. They're tossed with garlic, chili, peppercorn, onions. It's addicting eating this with a heaping spoon full of rice.Szechuan seafood. They offer this in Vancouver crab, shrimp and lobster. I've had all three - I personally like the lobster the best. It's a bit different from the normal preparation you'll see in a Chinese restaurant. The flavor will be the same in all three though. The lobster I feel is bit more than the shrimp but worth it. The crab is delicious but pricey.Stir-fried Chinese Long Beans. The beans are blistered and served with almost micro-diced mushrooms, ground pork and chilis. Of all the places I've tried this, I like they way they do it the best here.The line can get quite long on the weekends, it's very popular with the local crowd. Here's a tip, if you've got an idea on when you're planning to go - call ahead and ask for a Wait Number. This will place you in the queue en route to the restaurant. You may still have to wait a bit but I'd rather do 10 minutes than 45.\",\n",

There's so many options too, I really just threw ingredients I know I liked into my pot and it tasted amazing. We also ordered the pork ($4) which was really worth it, the pork was so fresh and added so much flavor and was definitely enough for two people. The sauce is what makes the dish though, you can make your own sauce out of other sauces and dip your food it in and that was honestly the best part. My only complaint was that the service wasn't that great. I get that it's a buffet but our waiter only came to our table once for water refills. Also they close so early at 10pm on a Friday night and have everything gone from the buffet by around 9:30. Definitely worth the wait though, I'd love to come back during their $13 lunch special.\",\n",

It was that time between late lunch and early dinner, so we had the place pretty much to ourselves.The staff was very attentive and aimed to please. We seated ourselves in one of the booths that line the wall and took in the view of the eclectic artwork and artifacts on display. The manager approached us and suggested a classic margarita, which I ordered, along with a Diet Coke for my husband, who was driving. We then had a friendly chat with Juan about our mutual love for the Yankees before he told us the story of his restaurant\\'s soft opening in late 2017 and the \"magic mirror\" on the wall.Fresh guacamole was prepared for us right at our table and the chips had come straight out of the oven.

Ok fair enough, but these are Manhattan or Montauk prices, not middle village or Glendale pricing. Service was not great. I could tell the moment I sat at the bar that it would be bad because the bar itself is super unorganized. Beer labels pointing all sorts of way, liquor bottles on the shelf a mess. The barback didn't know where to place my crab empanadas, I had to direct him to me. The crib empanadas seemed to have been placed in a wet dish because one side of them was crispy and the other very soggy. Gross. The empanadas weren't too bad, but unpleasant to eat with them being half soggy. I was going to stay and try to catch the Yankees game here, but not such a good experience. Bartender might need help. Also, check your receipts. I overheard the waitress and bartender conversing about adding auto tip to checks and no longer being timid to do so. I still tipped about 22%, but I doubt I'd ever come back here for any reason.

       " {'restaurant': 'Zum Stammtisch',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 1': 'My family has been coming here for years (and by years I really mean generations). My parents grew up coming to Zum Stammtisch when my grandparents lived in Ridgewood, and they carried that tradition forward when my sister, cousins and I were growing up. Prior to this most recent visit, it had been years since I visited Zum Stammtisch, but I\\'m happy to say that this place still delivers quality, both in terms of food and service.To start with the basics, Zum Stammtisch is a traditional German restaurant. In fact, the German derivation of the name means \"family table\". The inside of the restaurant almost feels like a combination of a tavern and a German hunting lodge, featuring dark wood furniture, rustic lighting, and Bavarian decor.Service here is also top notch. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable, and very service-oriented. We were here to visit my uncle\\'s birthday, so she also offered to take several pictures of us and made sure they were \"social media worthy\".Finally, let\\'s talk about the food. My family is very predictable in the sense that we all crave Sauerbraten (call it a family tradition). Sauerbraten is not easy to make (it takes days) and it\\'s quite simple to screw up (much like slow-roasted southern style brisket). Nevertheless, Zum Stammtisch doesn\\'t fail to deliver. The sauerbraten is tender (can cut with a fork) and covered with sweet-and-sour gravy. The side of red cabbage and dumplings (traditional for this dish) are also made perfectly here. In addition, every meal begins with free bread service (so good), and the beverage selections are on point (plenty of German beers and lots more to choose from).There\\'s not many of these places left, so I\\'m glad Zum Stammtisch is still around. It\\'s a classic German restaurant that focuses on service, food quality, and family. If you love German food, this place is a must. If you don\\'t like German food, this place might convince you otherwise.',\n",

It looks just like a German beer hall and took me straight back to Munich and Hamburg. From that moment on, I knew this was the real deal and was super excited.My husband and I came here on a Friday night for dinner. It was busy, but not super crowded. The menu appears to line up with what I have seen in my travels through Germany.Overall, the food tasted pretty authentic and was complete with large German portions! My husband ordered the bratwurst and knockwurst with home fries. The waitress brought mustard over for him; I was excited to have some of the sweet and spicy mustard like in the Hofbrauhaus. Too bad it was standard brown mustard. His dish was good, but I enjoyed mine more. I ordered the veal cordon bleu (comes with home fries) with a side of purple cabbage. I loved how cheesy my dish was -- it was dripping out and some cheese was even toasted in the fryer as it leaked out! The breading was thin and crispy. On the whole the dish was salty, creamy, and crunchy. I quite enjoyed it.My husband and I had a great dining experience. I would definitely come back to experience a bit of Germany in the U.S. Next time, we'll have to try some beer!\",\n",

The choices aren't as numerous as say Jackson Heights, but there's always one spot that doesn't disappoint. I'm glad to have found Bajeko Sekuwa for a lot of reasons.First, it's a very good location. They're right on Queens Boulevard! The only drawback to that is the parking isn't as good as other less travelled areas but I had already found street parking, so that wasn't my concern. It is very conveniently centrally located.Second, the service is very nice. The man in charge was a nice gentleman who made sure we got our seats and menus as soon as possible and later served us the food. I'm not someone that needs a lot of attention but the people here are very pleasant.Third, the food was delicious. I admit I don't know anything about Nepali cuisine. In fact some of the entrees seemed to be Indian but perhaps they were Nepali versions of things we recognize from Indian cuisine. My mother and I had palak paneer and some kind of eggplant curry. Both were very nicely done. And the nan bread was better than any other nan bread I had in recent memory.Although I give this restaurant five stars no place is perfect so I'll go over the imperfections.First, the speed from ordering to receiving food is a bit slow. I won't take any stars away for that because the food is good and good food takes time but if you're on a limited time interval for your meal, definitely take that into account.Second I thought it was slightly above average priced. But again I don't fault them for that because the food is good, the service is good, and the location is very convenient and I'm sure all those things jack up their expenses so that doesn't bother me. I certainly wouldn't go elsewhere just because it's a dollar cheaper because that's penny wise and pound foolish we all deserve to spoil ourselves if the food is good.Overall, outstanding restaurant.

       "  'Negative Review 1': \"I am disappointed to post this review, but I believe it is worthy of documenting my experience here.I visited with my family, and observed a small neighborhood self serve eats offering food by the pound.My family took turns going to the stations, and was rudely advised to refrain from video recording the premises. The cashier was worried about restaurant copy -cats from video which I politely explained trying to get a good angle via panorama to post on yelp. 3 servers approached me at once and I found the overall encounter upsetting and disturbing. 2 others strictly spoke in a different language to me. Cringe worthy. Discriminating. Disturbing.There are certain approaches to express concerns and these guys were rude and displayed gang mentality by way of bullying.The food stations were typical buffet islands of random ethnic foods and nothing spectacular or worthy of replicating. You toss out plastic plates upon finishing and you discard the trash in an outdoor garbage can on your way out the door.I will not be sharing the photos I took and 2 of my family members refused to even plate food deciding instead to not eat. To address the food, well it's a given when you leave without finishing what you paid for and prefer to throw it in the garbage instead of packing it away.Dry flaky salmon, rubbery chunks of steak, brown rice, beans, spaghetti & meatballs were among the food my family selected. None were fresh.If you somehow mess up rice/beans/spaghetti you should not be in the business of food preparation. Salmon was bland and they did not like it. Most ended up being shown to the trash. The petty rectangular stale chocolates the cashier came by and dropped off to my kids interrupted our meal- my oldest tried it and politely spit it out in her napkin. Rest were placed on the plastic plates and thrown into the garbage.As customers we kept our area clean, did not disrupt nor cause a scene, cleaned up after ourselves, paid for the food, and remained calm until our family finished their meals. We left our table clean. Unlike some of the other tables I observed where customers just left.This is not the best Brazilian restaurant in Queens or anywhere. With terrible basic customer service skills and the dummy account to counter my honest review, I begin to question the validity of the rest of their reviews. This place is not good, the people are not good and the visit was not good. Aside from quality of food at an establishment, the ambiance, attitude and service is important. I generously received a ONE star experience here for all of the above and will not be returning. Not one thing was good.After posting this review, I received a message from the restaurant. Image attached. Shameless!!Further, the owner Sidney continue to harass, send threats and has now resorted to lying. Video surveillance will be welcomed, as that will build my case and demonstrate us being compliant customers and prove how horrendous you and your staff are. This behavior is unacceptable and quite elementary.I refrained to escalate based on consideration to their establishment but due to Sidney's continued harassment, proper notices to appropriate authorities have been notified. I will no longer engage in communication with this fast food joint. Not worth my while.Beware upon entering this establishment. You have been fairly warned.Note: The review posted by Sidney C. (The owner) has since been removed. Thank you to the Yelp team for remaining fair in careful assessment. I am very glad to be part of a supporting team.\",\n",

Excellent blend of flavor and textures in every bite, and the waiters are quick and attentive. Spacious place with cute decor too, perfect for insta hah.My favorites: - oysters omelette. The accompanying dried fish sauce is so good! Good handful of juicy oysters in the basket and the omelette is fried to perfection. I could eat this one by myself over rice :P- pork belly fried rice with preserved vegetables!! Generous chunks of diced pork belly with a runny egg on top. Huge portion too- black pepper prawns and crabs. $28 but worth the try at least once. the sauce is so buttery!! A handful of tables ordered seafood here - radish cake omelette was so good, we ordered a second one - the whole hainanese chicken is worth the $36. The meat was so smooth and tender, even my grouchy picky parents loved it! Also, THEY TAKE THE BONES OUT! made it very enjoyable and easy to eat- French beans with minced pork is a yummy vegetable dish. Amazing with rice!- herbal pork soup with mushroom. Very herbacious and rich. Definitely get it to share for cold weather Things to skip: cuttlefish black ink pasta (not much flavor from the ink), hokkien noodles in broth (soggy mixed noodles), kaya toast (some jam on slightly toasted white bread). They were ok... but lacking in flavor/texture when compared to the other amazing items.We're definitely going back to try more food here. Really good for groups to share food and get a taste of everything. There were a few people waiting on a Saturday evening around 8pm but it wasn't too crazy.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Only a couple of authentic Singaporean food places in NYC and this is one of the good ones. My boyfriend and I have tried other Singaporean/ Malaysian places in Manhattan and Queens and have been disappointed by many. Located in the heart of Korean Flushing, Yummy Tummy is a strong contender. We overheard the owner having a long heart to heart conversation about Singaporean cuisine with a table of Singaporean customers. It was pretty cute! That's how you know the food is legit! We had the Otah Otah (my boyfriend's childhood favorite snack). It was my first time trying and I thought it was a bit interesting. It was a spicy and sweet fish paste wrapped in banana leaf. The texture reminded me of scrambled eggs. I recommend the Cai Tow Kueh which is like a stir fried radish cake. It's soft, sweet and savory. We also got the Singapore Chili Sauce crab. The gravy sauce was so good! It was a thick spicy tomato egg base. It came with fried buns to dip in the sauce. I was tempted to order some rice to eat with the leftover gravy. Unfortunately, the blue crab was a disappointment. It was a lot of effort peeling and gnawing at the shells with very little meat. The crabs were also very small and the meat was a bit soggy, probably previously frozen and then thawed. The sauce \\xa0flavor was spot on but the choice of crab could be better. I found out later that they offer Dungeness crab but you have to order a day in advance. That would probably have made the dish much better. \\xa0We finished our meal off with Bah Kut Teh (a pork herb soup). My boyfriend and I both liked it a lot. It was very rich and comforting. However, I would not recommend for everyone because of the herbal taste. If you don't like the taste of Chinese herbal soups then don't get it. I would like to come back another time and try other items on their menu!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Wow this Singaporean restaurant really amazed me this weekend! It has been on my radar ever since it opened, but I've been iffy about it due to the fluctuating reviews. First of all, the restaurant is very nicely decorated with a homey feel to it. It's modern at the same time and quite chic. Food was spectacular. We both really loved their house special crab chili with fettuccini. Their sweet chili sauce was amazing, tho I must say not spicy at all (for those who are expecting a kick to it) they had huge prawns which were awesome and the crab (if you have the patience to pick out all the little meats) were so tender and delicious. The crab and the sauce were really the star of the show. The hainanese chicken was excellent in terms of texture but I must say lacking in some flavor. They give you an interesting pesto and chili sauce on the side but I'm a little more used to the soy sauce version. However, the texture of the chicken was perfection and it was very juicy and tender. We really loved their oyster omelette as well ! It's not the most appealing in terms of looks, but it's super crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with lots of oysters in it ! Particularly loved the sauce that comes with it. We had to ask for a second round of sauce, because one wasn't enoughWe also gave the kaya toast a try since I know this is a Singaporean staple. I've never had one before so I can't say if it's truly authentic, but I really enjoyed it. Didn't care for the toast on the outside too much since it's just bread, but the coconut jam on the inside was so delightful and had the perfect amount of sweetness. I was really impressed with this place and can't wait to come back to try their other dishes !\",\n",

I thought it was normal but found out there was a pond of sticky, slimy liquid. Server told us it was egg white and it's totally normal but who would eat raw egg white with this dish? I've tried Singapore chili crab, definitely no raw egg white. Most importantly, the server sounds like he doesn't care to ask us if we want to get another dish or offer anything else.

The numbing sensation it gives and the slightly sour taste went so well with the hot rice. If we had to pick a least favorite dish it would be the wontons. They were seasoned too sweetly for us and the bright pink meat for me personally was off-putting. The pork with bean curd was good but way too salty for us.

Toxic owners who could not take responsibility for their own mistakes, instead of just apologizing and moving on they continued their childish behavior. I really have never seen such a joke for a owner. The experience ive had with this restaurant is almost surreal. I have literally seen at least 15 fake reviews.

I personally did not enjoy the service the treatment I received from my server and the incorrect order that was served to me. ** original review. Disgusting digusting. Horrible server who refused to acknowledge that she messed up our order, and tried to have us pay for her mistake. Ive never had an establishment who failed to rectify their mistake. She came back to the table upset and yelling at us. Her coworkers asked her why she had such a bad attitude and she just put her hands up in the air and said i dont care i dont care.To the owner: It seems like you need glasses then. If you \"reviewed the tapes\" you would have seen us, and seen your extremely rude waitress. Considering my bowl was full when she brought it back was proof enough. Her interactions with us at the end was even worse when she yelled at us while she was walking away. If we enjoyed our time, why would we write a bad review? That doesn\\'t even make sense. I have no problem reviewing and giving 5 stars to places that deserve it in my neighborhood. Your server really is the reason you guys deserve a 1.P.s the owner\\'s wife or server (someone who is clearly afflicted with the business, harasses and stalks you if you leave a bad review. They literally stalk your account, its funny thinking about how someone who has so much time in their life to do that. They also have several fake accounts to review their own restaurant and accounts to harass others who also leave bad reviews.

It had 4 different dips, Greek Olives, fresh tomatoes, and toasty pita squares. Each dip was super fresh and tasty. We appreciated the separate spoons served for each individual dip.

We also tried the Loukaniko. It was very tasty. We squeezed fresh lemon over it and it brought out the flavor even more. For dessert we shared the Lemon Sorbetto.

The filet actually had zero flavor yet the crab meat that was in it was completely over seasoned. In fact majority of the food was way too heavily seasoned to enjoy the actual seafood. The \"bread crumbs\" on the baked clams was way too thick and overpowering. The crab legs were pretty good but that was about the only thing that was good.

Love how many things there are for vegetarians. Generous w sauces \\xa0- oh the sauces. MmmmToday I got a bowl lunch special. Comes w soda. You choose a base a protein side a sauce and a topping. Lots of options. Vegetarian if you want it. 2 kinds ofChicken - pulled or grilled. Beef pork Etc. I got a salsa verde and it was spicy and delicious. At first I thought I wouldn't have enuf sauce but I didn't even need the whole thing. I got grilled chicken (pollo a la plancha which is $1 more) salad greens roasted sweet potato picked onions and I added avocado (95 cents more) and grilled corn ($1 more). I am totally full hours later. Generous portions. Fresh ingredients. So flavorful. Forget chipotle and support your local business! I got a limeade and it was made fresh. You control the sugar.

Pork rind arepa - everything was good in it except pork rind. It was kinda hard and tough. A little dry and bland. Again maybe end of night. Got our food around 9:45 Pm.

For $7.75 or $7.95, you get:- Fried wonton strips with duck sauce- Your entree choice- Rice, be it white, brown, or fried- Soup (Egg drop, hot and sour, wonton soup), egg roll, or sodaThe decor of the restaurant is a nice middle ground; not so run down and depressing that you\\'re afraid a bathtub from the apartment on the floor above is going to come crashing through water-soaked ceiling tiles and kill you, nor so ensconced in imported marble tiles and trendy lighting that you wind up paying $20 for a $10 meal. It can get a bit busy for dinner so either show up early, late, or be prepared to wait. But a restaurant in NYC that is completely empty for dinner is a bad sign and probably not long for this world so...I\\'ve never ordered take out from here, so cannot comment on that; I always swing by.

I take that as a good sign, unlike when I walk into a place in Chinatown where 95% of the people are white tourists, at which point my inner monologue starts screaming \"ABORT. ABORT.\" Service is also prompt and definitely earns a high mark.In summation, I like this restaurant and recommend it if you\\'re in the area.

Not sure how that makes sense. After we were finally seated we were only given the drink menu and we were abandoned for another ten minutes. When we asked for a food menu, we were snapped at rudely again to the point that the whole table went silent from shock for a moment. Finally, the appetizers came. We were all so hungry at this point because it was about an hour after we arrived. The food was good but the portions were so tiny ! We were hoping and praying for better with dinner but again we were disappointed. The chicken biryani was ridiculous. It was enough to feed one person and it was basically just rice and chicken.

Like the other customers, I decided to just keep my jacket on. I ordered a couple arepas, one beef with cheese and one shrimp. Came out a little cold. Ate them anyway since I was starving.The next morning, I started violently vomiting. It was like something out of a horror movie. The projectile vomit was soon accompanied by cramps, chills, diarrhea, and a fever. I spent the whole weekend bedridden sipping on fluids to keep from dying.My theory is that due to the restaurant being so cold, they couldn't keep their food at the appropriate temperature. This became breeding ground for bacteria.What sucks is that I've been here a couple times before and enjoyed their food; but now I can't trust it. A safety inspector definitely needs to come in and check this place out. It literally is a bio hazard and unsafe for the public.\",\n",

Inside is warm and welcoming, mostly locals from the neighborhood. I came upon this place after my sister was raving about it, she worked a few store fronts down in the neighboring plaza. It became a routine lunch spot for her for quick, cheap, tasty eats.We came in on a Sunday evening, approximately 30 mins wait time that turned into 45 roughly. Not a bad sign, the more packed a place is the better the food would be. Owners wife knows my sister personally as a reoccurring customer, and came to greet us while we were waiting. She took our order so there'd be a shorter wait. (Unfortunately messed up one order, but complimentary Thai iced teas on the house!)After reading the reviews for the most popular items, I decided to try the French fries Provençal. Pro, they were hot and crispy, con they were obnoxiously garlicky. They sufficed as we waited for our bowls of Pho. I got the spicy broth with shrimp, and my sister got the brisket pho. Omg. The spicy broth is to die for. Its the perfect balance of spicy and savory. The pho is brought out in a massive steaming bowl. (First thought is wow, this is huge I can't finish it, but once you get started it's gone.) Its warm and filling, the rice noodles are soft and the broth practically sticks to it. There are also scallions, onions, bean sprouts, jalapeños and a few other things topping you can add to make it your own. It's the kind of broth that makes your nose runny but you can't stop eating! And as for my sister, she's literally orders the same Brisket Pho everytime, so I'm assuming it's good. Total bill, $36. not bad for a dinner for 2 Definitely returning but before the dinner rush.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I am VERY impressed with the pho at this restaurant. First time, I ordered a bowl with rare steak, and I almost cried, partially from joy, partially because the jalapeños are SPICY! The broth is just how I like it, hot, flavorful, not greasy. I can be quite picky when it comes to pho, and this pho is deserving of five stars.Today, I came back for another bowl. This time, I got the rare steak/brisket, which was a great call. The brisket is lean and delicious, a perfect complement to the rare steak. I asked for extra cilantro and jalapeños, and the waitress quickly procured a dish for me. At the end, I lifted the bowl to my lips, gulping until there was nothing left.If you like southern Vietnamese pho, this is a terrific place to get it. (I was not as impressed by the pork banh mi, but that's not really my scene anyway.) Your glass of water probably isn't going to get refilled, so get a bubble tea or a pitcher of Sapporo or something. Bathroom is in the back.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'I don\\'t go out for Italian too often because I am lucky to know excellent home cooks that feed me real deal Italian home cooking, and my working class roots make classic red sauce pizzerias/restaurants take care of the crave. Ninos AQ piqued my interest with the unique ingredients described on the menu and quirky choices like \"Mexican Street Corn\" that you wouldn\\'t find in everyday Italian places. Perhaps its better to describe this as New American by way of Italy.Service was good and our dishes came out family style in the order we requested. Here\\'s my take on the food:Crispy Burrata for 2: 1st thought was $18 for a large cheese ball, this better be something special. It wasn\\'t. Disappointing since the inside was more like thick ricotta encased in mozzarella. I\\'ve had this similar dish elsewhere where the creamy burrata mixes with the sauce making you want to lick the bowl clean - not here unfortunately.Truffled Prosciutto Pizza: Had a nice \"truffle\" smell when it came out, but I didn\\'t get any flavor. I also thought the cooked prosciutto pieces were too large making for salty bites. Creamy ricotta, decent dough saved by the pizza rule even when its bad it\\'s still pretty good.Gnocchi Cacio E Pepe: Interesting idea, but terrible execution. Easily the worst thing I ate here - gummy gnocchi; watery stringy sauce; no cheese or pepper flavor. Bland tasting like mushy gruel. Pass on this. ($21 for this! Got 12 Gnocchi. $1.75 per gnocchi hahaha)Nicky Santoro\\'s Veal Parm for 2: Certainly an impressive looking bone in veal chop platter (Hello Instagram!). If they did a chicken parm with the same prep you probably couldn\\'t tell the difference - seems like a waste of a veal chop (Check out Positano in Williston Park on LI that simply grills their quality chops to know the difference). The acid of the tomato and maybe a hit of lemon was way high for me.Orange Glazed Short Ribs: Best dish of the night, but inconsistently cooked. The first pieces I tried were fall apart tender and good flavor, but the next piece I had was a bit over cooked and dry. I liked the pattypan squash and celery root puree.We passed on dessert, and called it an early night. Saw many people dining outside and enjoying cocktails - you may want to do this instead of a full meal. I had a quality, well made Negroni.Special shout out to my friends for celebrating my birthday with me here - I wish the dinner was knock it out of the park like you all are always!',\n",

We tried the dumpling (vegetarian) appetizer and some of the dumplings was still somewhat semi frozen & cold which made us think it wasn't cooked properly, unless it's supposed to be cold like that???

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I have passed this place in the last three and a half years without stopping in. I have been hungry many of times and just didn't stop in. So today with time to kill I stopped in. When I entered I was immediately greeted by one of the staff members who said I can sit anywhere I chose. I sat approximately 3 seats in. The waiter came over with a smile and very personable took my order and I asked him a couple question about the business and within a few minutes maybe my food was on the table. I also asked the gentleman who I assumed was a manager, heavyset, tall, handsone gentlemen,possibly Greek I'm not sure. I asked him a few questions about the business as well I was told that the restaurant under the current name has been operating for 7 years. It was called the olympic diner before ,7 years ago. I looked for pictures to compare decor but none found. Currently there's a beautiful green light that runs throughout the building lit perfectly to give you a cozy feeling. The borders are stainless steel that runs around the door and is also found on the ceiling very well shine I did not see any rust spots in the stainless steel. Which is a beautiful thing. There's an old clock that is situated right above the entrance of the door very nice. The bathroom, ladies very clean and the company Cintras has put some color to bathroom toiletries. Which helped the set the bathroom the core. Is even a change in station for the babies. Perfectly thought of. I got to give it to this place clean floors beautiful walls with pictures rose gold color panel in some areas not overburden the place. Now I already complimented the staff and the decor let's talk about prices. I had as you see in the picture two eggs over easy with cheese and grits toasted wheat bread and a cup of coffee which I believe was on the board as a special. My cost came up to $10 and some change I think that's a bit much however I was willing to pay it because everything else was satisfying. I even left a tip which I always do when I'm satisfied. I really really appreciate \\xa0that the sugar jar, salt shaker and pepper shaker, as well as the ketchup bottle had no \\xa0residue of use on them. They were all clean. I looked around at other tables to see if it was just my table that was clean and every last table behind me and in front of me presented clean white off salt and pepper shaker ketchup jars as well as sugar jars. The stainless steel that surround the border of the wall was shining everything was in place. You know what really caught my attention you know at some restaurants you can go to and look up at the light fixture and they'll be dust hanging off of the hinges that hold the light fixture into the ceiling? At this place each and every one of the fixtures we're clean no dust at all. I certainly appreciate this no dust in the corners no dust or buildup grease on the chairs. I certainly will be back. will return one day with my group which is approximately 6 people and we as a group when they leave a review. I'm sure they will say the same thing if not something better about this place. The only thing I can say that prevented the Classic Diner from getting a five-star is the cashier. I greeted her by saying hello. I did not receive a response from her. I don't know why I'm going to check it up that she did not hear me. However even if you did not hear me if I'm approaching you with the bill the professional thing to do is to say hello how was your meal or hello was everything okay I didn't get that from her. It wasn't until I handed her my money she said hello and I responded with a hello. I thought this was quite odd but nonetheless Maybe she just didn't hear me the truth of the matter I doubt that was the situation. I was going to take a picture of her but chose not to just in case it was my misunderstanding. I noticed that when the men approached her she greeted them smiling. Now when it comes to business I don't see gender or sex I see business and I think that should be the way it should be handled but maybe everyone doesn't think that way. I'll find out when I return with my group if she is \\xa0still there. Nonetheless good job Classic Diner good job.\",\n",

The whole point of getting a beverage is to enjoy it with your meal. The owner walked in just as we were about to leave and checked up on us, which made me a bit relieved that he's still attentive to the customers. He needs to train his employees how to do that because they SUCK. The food is delicious but the portions are drastically smaller now and the prices have gone up.

It's amazing that so many people have found it and recognized it. The second reason it's a hidden gem is that, despite being called 'dumpling house,' this is really a primo noodle spot.The dumplings are good too, but being a noodle fiend that's what I usually order. Hot and chewy lo mein is cooked fresh to order in a full size wok. It's not fast food and you may have to wait a little, but it's real food with plenty of meat and veggies. It's fatty and satisfying without tasting greasy.If it's a cold noodle you're after, the sesame noodle is a great specimen of the dish. It has great sesame flavor with a nice amount of cucumber and, it must be said, a spectacular portion size. I always want to stop at half of it but I can never make myself.This place is SLAMMED at lunch time, but no matter how busy the cashier staff is they're always courteous and attentive. It's far above-average service for an eatery of this size that has to turn over this much business.

The broth goes very well with pork; we rarely choose sliced pork when we go to other hot pot places but we always order it here. We also love the Thai ice tea, which is the best we've ever had. The tea is flavorful and the milk does not overwhelm the tea flavor. It is not overly sweet either.Another charm of this place is the garlic fried rice! The first time we went, we didn't know there was garlic rice so we ate a lot and were very full. My husband got a bowl to try and omg it was the best fried rice we've had. Couldn't believe how I was able to eat one bowl and my husband two bowls after all the hot pot food we've had. You know how sometimes you get super full and regret eating so much? We were super full in the end but don't regret eating it. The staff here are super friendly and keeps coming to ask if you need anything extra. They are consistently friendly every time.Come here early during winter months because it's always packed. They offer free hot pot on the day of your birthday, so it's like under $15 per person for both of us, super worth it!We took away one star because of the limited food options and the broth was not as tasty the last time we went.

Still not good, they never fixed the kinks with the wait staff and the inconsistencies in the kitchen. I don't understand the other reviews at all, this is mediocre food at best let alone daring to call it French Cuisine. \\xa0My party of four left very dissatisfied and vowed not to return.The food was very inconsistent, one dish ok, then the others were meh to worse. \\xa0The menu is quite extensive so the chef needs to churn out dishes from every category; which could be the issue. The only food item that saved this review from being a 1 star was the scallops. I'll give credit to the Chef here, he knows his scallops. Both the Scallop appetizer and the entree which he custom made for us, Scallops over risotto, were cooked perfectly. \\xa0The pairings/items that accompany with - not so much.For instance, in the Scallop appetizer plate, it's three seared scallops nice and plump, served over spinach. I love spinach but these were over cooked and soggy. With the custom risotto dish, the risotto and seared scallops were delicious on its own but he drizzled a brown gravy like au jus. Didn't need it at all. \\xa0It was adding color but no value to the taste almost masking the good parts of the dish.The small plates:The moules with white wine and garlic sauce we had to send back. I never send back food!! The Mussels arrived almost half empty which leads me to believe they were sitting under the shells or the pieces fell out in the pot - still in the kitchen. Of the two I sampled, both had sand! It was terrible. The waiter apologized and took it off the bill. Thanks for that at least. \\xa0We were so not happy about it.The escargot has to be right... It's a French Restaurant. Ours had plenty of pesto and the toasted bread medallions on top were a nice touch. But too much oil and not enough garlic. It didn't lend any flavor to the escargot itself. Decent for what it was and at this point, my expectations were shot. The buffalo chicken meatballs were exactly as stated, buffalo sauce and yes, they were meatballs. Skip. Nothing to write here.The risotto fritters funny enough were shaped like Meatballs and had great contrasting colors. They were more charred than I would prefer but it was offset by the rouguefort cheese - creamy, sauce like. Again, looked disappointing but tasted ok.The best thing of the evening and that's not saying much, were the cocktails we had and the warm baguettes. The Spritzer, the Strawberry Basil Gin, and the St. Germaine cocktails we had, we enjoyed hence the second star. \\xa0Sorry folks, service was not great either. While the waiter was gracious to remove the Mussels app that was not good off our bill, he was not good with the overall service. We didn't get serving spoons, no fresh plates. Our bread plate should not have been our dining plate. It was just a mess of an evening. Never returning. SMH.\",\n",

We stopped in around 7 PM last night to and it was pretty slow. It was cold out and I had a tea I needed to finish.I asked the friendly blonde server if it was OK if. She said it was no problem and we thanked her for her flexibility. We are perusing the bar menu when a middle aged woman with a nose ring (TN) informs me that I will have to throw it out. Her tone is nasty to say the least. I calmly tell her that I\\'m almost done with it, we\\'re ordering cocktails, and that the other server said it was OK to finish. TN Narrows her eyes with absolute contempt and says \"Who told you THAT? Someone who\\'s NOT THE MANAGER?\" as she darts a dirty look between myself and the offending server. I probably looked at her like she was crazy because she was acting just that. Look, I\\'ve worked in the service industry. I understand that dealing with people sucks but I cannot emphasize enough that we were polite and calm despite her obvious hostility over something so petty. The other server sheepishly apologized for the manager\\'s rudeness but it was not her fault at all and I honestly feel bad for the employees who have to work with such a rude and unreasonable person.I would say the final straw came when I got my teeny cocktail. An Aperol spritz is usually served in a pretty sizable wine glass and for $13 it was a pitiful amount.

But a box for 25 cent?! I'm sorry I can't help thinking that it's a rip off. I don't think a plastic bag and box cost that much since I believe they purchase it with wholesale price.

Unfortunately, the food was bland and had no real \"omg yum\" moments. The \"garlic monkey bread\" was a hot dog bun pressed flat with the fixings. The bread tasted like it was on the verge of going bad and the pull apart was this stale bun cut up in 6 pieces. I ordered the cubano and it looked nothing like the pictures on this yelp site. Again, the cubano was in a stale hotdog bun pressed and cut in half. With a sandwich like that, it\\'s crucial to have the right bread to make sure the juices from the meat don\\'t soak up in the bread making it too soggy. In minutes I couldn\\'t eat the other half because of exactly that. I will say my sister\\'s spicy chicken sandwich was pretty good and their chicken wings are',\n",

So if I lived by PS 207 which is the 2 mile mark, I can get delivery for $2, but because I'm at 164th Avenue its $10.If it wasn't for my wife insisting on wanting the burger and then going to pick it up I would have cancelled the order. It's a shame. I could understand adding a charge if it was going to broad channel, you have to go over the bridge and it is significantly further away as far as delivers go, but not $10.

I still think about it. I also love the bolognese.I have one very tiny complaint - you can either get a meat plate, or a cheese plate (pricey). Not both. I would love for them to give the option of a meat and cheese plate, as that is something we really enjoy with a nice glass of wine.The service is always excellent, the ambiance is wonderful (especially when you can sit outside!), and the food is authentic and beautifully prepared. It is not cheap, but you get what you pay for in this case - gorgeous, delicious food.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Always enjoy dinner here. Their special appetizer of mussels with fried prosciutto was delicious and huge! My husband had the steak - medium rare exactly and I had clam linguine. Wine was fabulous too. Have been back here about 4 times. By ourselves and with small groups. Each time everyone has been very happy.',\n",

We were told that the only available options were a fixed menu for $68 a person. Immediately we were seated next to a couple who was visibly ordering things off the regular menu and being accommodated. When the waiter came to our table, we were told explicitly that we could only order off the fixed menu. Looking around us, other tables were served outside of the fixed menu as well.Unfortunately things didn't get better from there. The service was very inattentive. Yes, it was busy but the restaurant is small. We had to ask for water and for bread, though other tables who arrived after us were serviced, which was incredibly awkward. We enjoyed the appetizer immensely, and both ordered the filet mignon. It was a while between courses. I ordered my filet medium, but when I cut into it it was visibly well done. It wasn't that warm so it's likely it has been sitting there and cooked more as a result. My boyfriend did receive his medium as requested. We also had to ask for steak knives because those weren't provided.Dessert was extremely lackluster. They offered dessert for 2, melted chocolate fondue, but the portion was extremely small, and yet we were only allowed one. (So in essence part of the $68 was for half dessert). The melted chocolate also came out cold so it was likely sitting in the kitchen like the steak. The selection of dessert that came with the chocolate was a handful of berries and some cookies. It was sparse and not a great end to the meal.I'm so disappointed. I wanted to like this place but I don't think I'll be coming back.\"},\n",

I can see why it is now!There isn\\'t a parking lot dedicated to the deli. However, there is metered parking in the front and residential parking around the corner of the deli.If there isn\\'t a line inside the restaurant, you can probably get a sandwich in-and-out within 10-15minutes. Once you walk-in, you will be greeted by a server who will take and make your order. During this particular visit, I ordered a Tony\\'s Special with Fresh Mozzarella on a hero with a little vinaigrette. It is definitely better than \"regular\" mozzarella but I feel like you get more meat when you do order it with \"regular\" mozzarella. Tony\\'s Special was something off the menu, that runs around $10. It is worth trying because of how fresh, clean, and simple around the mixture of meat, cheese, and bread. If you ever need a great sandwich, I recommend you to stop by Tony\\'s for some of Tony\\'s Special. Btw, they accept cash only but an ATM machine is available.',\n",

I've had an omelette with spinach, mushroom, and onions and a garden omelette with cheddar; they were both delicious. The omelettes come with a side of home fries but their was nothing special about them. On both occasions I was here the service was terrible.

Let's start with the experience when we first arrived a lady greeted us at the door we were the first ones there. She was extremely pleasant which is why the 2 stars. Our waitress come a totally different experience. We were ready to order so she came back about 3 times when we were finally ready I asked if they had fried fish which I didn't see on the menu she said yea. Then proceeded to ask me how I like my eggs I told her I didn't want eggs she was like it's a combo. I asked can I have fried fish on the side, the answer was no. My Mr. order the combo, so I asked can he have extra fish, the answer was no. At this point I'm annoyed because if I'm paying for something why can't I have it. I settled with the wings no fries just wings. We get our food, looks good I'm still a little disappointed about the fish. I took a piece of my MR. Fish and I am happy I didn't order it, it was gross tasted like fish sticks. The chicken was okay until I looked in it and it was fatty mess. The fish went untouched and my Mr. ask can he swap out for something else, you guessed the answer was no, even if we didn't like the food we will still have to pay and also pay for whatever we would want to swap it out for so we opted not to. I've attached pictures. For 2 people gratuity was already included never saw that before esp when it was only 2 people and she didn't deserve $5.50, on top of gratuity it was a service charge as well.

It was cooked well and the breading wasn't too heavy. Not better than the standard, but tasted great with the accompanying sauces - Pastas: 1. Tagliolino del Poeta - I recommend this dish.

During our 1hr 45min stay, we ordered 3 rounds of drinks, we split 2 entrees, and when we were not quite full, we topped ourselves off with one their giant pretzels to snack on. After we finished the pretzel, each of us still had half a glass of beer left, when our waitress Stef (I\\'m guessing it\\'s short for Stephanie/Stefanie) came around and asked if we wanted anything else, upon which I said \"we\\'re good for now, thank you\" (meaning we could still order more food/drinks later, but we still had our current beers to finish). At that point, things went sour and downhill in the blink of an eye, as Stef decided to take it upon herself to let us feel very unwelcome. She told us since you\\'re not ordering anything now, we\\'ll need this other table you\\'re using (they had squeezed together 2 SMALL sized tables to fit the 3 of us) and with a BIG attitude, she felt the need to add, \"I\\'ve fit 8-10 people where you\\'re sitting at in the past, so you guys should have no problem squeezing in.\" Then her and another waitresses swooped in and AGGRESSIVELY separated our tables and SLAMMED a plastic chair at one end. First off, we would\\'ve gladly squeezed in and given them the other table to use, but why did Stef and the other wait staff have to be so rude, and more importantly, why did she feel compelled to add such a nasty statement at the end. We\\'d been polite and kept the food and drinks coming during our stay, not once was there a lull where our table was empty. And yet she made us all feel like we were dirt, like we were \"table squatters\" who just ordered 1 round of beers and were \"hoarding\" the tables so other patrons could not be seated. Even my Father-In-Law picked up on the whole \"negative vibe\" and told us, \"I don\\'t need anything else from here. We can go somewhere else.\" At that point, I couldn\\'t get the attention of any of the waitresses to get the check so I went up to the bar to settle our bill. While I was paying, I calmly told the the manager what we had been through, how it made us feel very unwelcome and he said he would talk to the waitress. I was turning to leave when Stef came back and asked if I had a problem with her service. I told her that what she had said and done made us feel very unwelcome and she could\\'ve been more professional. She then proceeded to SCREAM at both me and my wife and told us, \"what the heck is wrong with you guys, you could\\'ve came to me if you had a problem.\" \\xa0Here I was trying to describe to her the situation and how us, AS CUSTOMERS, felt like we were TREATED POORLY. The whole time I was talking to her in a normal, even tone, but she kept on going with her ballistic screaming at the top of her lungs at us. She finally screamed, \"I won\\'t apologize for my actions because I don\\'t feel like I did anything wrong (evidently she needs a lesson in customer service, and she made it clear that she wasn\\'t listening to me, even though she had asked me to tell her what she had did wrong in the 1st place) and then she ended it by waving her arms wildly and telling us \"to get the F*%K out, get out!!!!!!!!\" I\\'d also like to add, that not once during Stef\\'s entire wild 5 min episode, did the manager look to step in (all while all the other patrons were watching in utter shock).

Until now.I called to order for pickup around dinner time (5:00pm-6:00pm or so).Although it's not specifically on the menu, I asked if they could make chicken tikka masala (which is one of my favorite dishes ever) but with paneer (cubed cheese) instead of chicken, as I try to avoid meat on Mondays (Meatless Mondays). The gentleman that I spoke with said it would be fine. I also ordered saag paneer, as that, and palak paneer, is also a favorite of mine. And I topped it off with two naan - one plain and one garlic/onion.I was told 15 minutes before it was ready and that time was pretty spot on. I picked it up, the staffperson at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The total came to approximately 35 for the above, and included two small orders of basmati rice and a small cup of a rice pudding-esque dessert (coconut kheer, perhaps?).Everything was spectacular. I'm grateful it's about halfway from my home to my girlfriend's home. Even the next day, for lunch, everything reheated perfectly and was just as yummy. I even have another portion of tikka for tomorrow with some rice and half a naan. The portions are of a good size. The whole order was for two of us and we ate our fill. So, I would estimate that it was 5 portions total in the whole order of pickup. So, I would say it came to $8.00 per meal, since I left some tip from the pickup.I will definitely be coming back for eat-in and take out. I don't know if I can convince myself to try something different, because these two entrees were so yummy.I recommend checking them out and support the business if you like their food and service.\",\n",

The vindaloo was pretty spicy for me but comfortable for him, but I had more because it was so savory and I'm a masochist.

Food was great- shrimp mofongo was a lot better than I expected since I'm not a big fan of plantains, mussels were good- just a littttleeee too salty, and oysters and clams hit the spot. We got two dozen of each during happy hour!My only issue was that they took FOREVER to serve our food. We placed an order for two dozen oysters and clams, clam chowder, mussels, and mofongo but had to wait about an hour just for the first dish to arrive and then probably another 30 minutes for everything else to arrive. \\xa0They forgot to put in our clam chowder order as well but we easily forgave since we were already stuffed from the oysters and didn't want to wait another hour.\",\n",

Still, we apprehensively ordered them.Here's the bottom line: They were stale and chewy like it had been made days before. Not fresh. \\xa0They were also very small. Don't order them.

Our server was either overwhelmed or brand new. She wasn't confident with the menu based on our ordering process. \\xa0She dropped another table's check at our table before we were even served drinks. Our drink order was taken to the wrong table. Food was brought to our table that wasn't ours. \\xa0There's so much more I could nitpick but those were the major issues. There were other guests visibly upset with service nearby so it didn't appear to be an isolated thing. \\xa0At the end of the day, we paid $130 for oysters that were either not completely shucked from the shell or ones that were mangled during opening and a 45 minute wait between oysters and entrees that was blamed on what I ordered (a skirt steak sandwich).I work as a restaurant manager. The worst thing a server can do is not take ownership of his or her mistakes and ignore the tables they've already mistreated.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"I've finally found a great Hunanese restaurant!!Hunan cuisine has a great tradition and is famous among Chinese for delicious, unique spicy flavor. It creates this flavor with the use of many fresh ingredients including garlic, peppers and shallots in comparison to Sichuan flavor which is more greasy and employs more dried preservatives such as sichuan peppercorns. I should know. My family is Hunanese. While driving around the city you see lots of signs of Hunan this and that, it seems all of those restaurants are just take-out places for the masses or Sichuan restaurants in disguise. Hunan Kitchen of Grand Sichuan is the real deal.Upon walking in on a recent Thursday evening, I noticed how very busy they were. Lots of customers, both Chinese and American, and even some Indian-looking folks. Young and old, families, attractive couples, etc. My cousin who is from the mainland and really knows her stuff did all the ordering. We skipped the typical (double cooked pork, ma po tofu, etc) and tried some more exotic dishes. The first dish was a knock out. Shao tsao hay shan yang (as it is pronounced) - black pepper stir fried lamb with red peppers and greens. It was probably the best lamb dish I've ever had. No pungency or overbearing meat smell at all but retaining all the deliciousness and tender taste of the lamb. Seasoned to perfection and of course goes great with rice. We then ordered pork shoulder sauteed on a crockpot of sorts, pronounced kao ghu so. Also very delicious if a bit heavier than some may like. It was very flavorful, cooked with potatoes and nuts and the meat was superbly tender. Definitely eat it with rice as it was quite spicy and salty. As my cousin explained, this is like a better version of double cooked pork. We also had shueh le hong (my botched pronounciation) - a stir fried veggie dish. Not sure what the vegetable used was unfortunately but at least I have captured the pronounciation for next time. It too was delicious but salty - that's why you have to eat it with rice. It had a spicy kick to it, which was nice. Not used to eating spicy veggie stir fry dishes that are this good. I know I would botch the attempts in my kitchen to give veggies a spicy flavor. Also we had a spicy fish dish- duo la ghao yu toe (pepper fish head). I think the type of fish used was carp. It was very tender with lots of meat and the spices gave it a nice flavor but I could still taste a bit of the fishiness underneath. Overall, it was a great meal. We fed a table of 5 adults with 2 beers ordered, and a decent amount of left-overs and the final cost was under $105 from what I remember. Not too bad.\",\n",

She didn't like it much cuz the majority of the menu was fried. I like fried food, but I found everything to be pretty average.

I recently went with a group of 6 on a Saturday night around 8:30PM and it was surprisingly not busy, we were seated quickly.The food comes out as prepared so it's usually still fresh and steaming hot. The sweet potato fries are crispy with the maple glaze - we like picking them up with chopsticks ahha. The kimchi fried rice comes with a runny egg and cut up pieces of sausage - very flavorful slightly on the oily side though. Now for the showstopper: the stuffed wings!! My favorite is the kimchi stuffed and the spicy corn, but honestly the shrimp one is good too. The wings are perfectly shaped and stuffed that you can actually pick them up with your chopsticks if you don't want to touch them! They're usually hot so don't eat too fast. We also got a half and half combo with sweet soy garlic and crispy Cajun: as a table, we agreed the sweet soy garlic was better not to say the crispy Cajun was bad, we just liked the sweet glaze more.Other times, I've tried the army stew which is great complemented by a side of white rice to balance the spicy. If you're with a group of friends, consider ordering a pitcher of the yogurt soju drinks. Overall, I'd love to always stop by for my Korean student fried chicken fix here!

Lamb patty done right, had crisp edges, was seasoned well, had Caribbean zing to it. Topped w/cheddar and possibly shredded mozzarella cheese melted. Accompanied by a spicy sauce - looks like pink sauce (ketchup/mayo) but it''s not. Spice lovers will appreciate level of spice.

Bottom line, this place has delicious food, friendly staff and leaves you feeling better than when you came in. But you'll pay a pretty penny for it ($3 for soda can, $+30 for pasta) hence why price to food ratio/taste is debatable; especially when you consider the location it currently is in, you wouldn't expect such prices.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"This place is located along Bell Blvd, and we came here because it was open late on a Saturday night (we got there around 10). We only ordered two thing: xiao long bao (soup dumplings) and pan-fried dumplings.The xiao long bao is nothing to write home about. The wrapper/skin on these baos is so thin and the bamboo steamer the dumplings are served on are so small that all the dumpings stick together; thus, whenever you try to pull a dumpling out, the wrapper rips and the soup just spills out. Other than that, the actual meat in the dumpling is good but the soup itself is rather cloudy. I find that with soup dumplings, people have their own ways to measure whether they thing they're good or not, and clarity/transparency of soup is one of those for me. These baos aren't my favorite.The pan-fried dumplings, however, are delicious. Everything about them is good - the meat (which I believe is the same near used in the soup dumplings), the beautifully crisp and golden bottom, and the thickness of the dough/skin. I love the way the skin soaks up the soup and it becomes so flavorful.I also really like that this restaurant is open late on weekends, but I haven't found anything quite yet to *really* set it apart from restaurants with similar menus.That being said, I will probably come back to try more of their menu items.*One major thing I disliked about this place was the chopsticks (pictured below). For some reason, they have reusable chopsticks with disposable tips? It makes no sense at all, and it was impractical because, by the end of our meal, the tips had already fallen off for us twice. If they're trying to be ergonomical, they might as well stick with disposable ones. Otherwise, reusable ones make much more sense for a restaurant like this. The chopsticks were a huge turn-off for me.\",\n",

While the food and drinks were tasty the service and establishment itself were horrendous. My problem with this business is that the prices are way too high, and I expected absolute perfection but that is not the case. I definitely don't reccomend this place unless you like to be ripped off.We walked in with no reservation on a saturday night around 6:25 pm . It was quite empty so seating wasn't an issue . Once we were seated by the bartender and given menus .Our waitress came over and quickly ordered \\xa0the ceviche a la diabla as an appetizer . Before we could order our entrees she walked away . So we decided to wait till she made an appearance \\xa0again . Once she came over with our appetizer we orders our main course . I ordered the special which was grilled salmon with a pomegranate sauce , shrimp and yuca . I asked if i can substitute the yuca for grilled veggies and she said their would be an up-charge . Which sounded ridiculous but fine at the moment as we were starving . My boyfriend ordered the bandeja típica. Now we ordered before two tables walked in and our food took nearly an HOUR to come out . What left me confused and very irritated was that the tables that arrived after we put our entrees orders got their food before us . How ?? I simply don't understand . I work in the restaurant industry and i am very understanding when its busy and the food takes long but it was half empty and our waitress didn't even come not once to apologize or perhaps even offer my boyfriend another drink as courtesy to keep your customers coming back . After waiting and feeling forgotten for almost an hour we finally got our food . No complaints on my boyfriends entree . But mine was another story . I literally saved my dinner because i asked to have the sauce on the side . The pomegranate sauce was way too sweet and gritty. Had I not specified to have it on the side it would have made my dish inedible . The grilled vegetables were saturated in oil but by then i just wanted to be done with the place and leave . Once again after waiting to get the waitress attention we finally got our bill . Now i understand manhattan establishment prices are in the higher end but there is no reason for overly priced food in queens to make me feel like i was in the city . What made this dining experience even worse was that my the special i ordered was charged $32 for TWO small shrimp , salmon and a few vegetables . I was better off \\xa0ordering \\xa0their menu item that was the a grilled salmon as well with a side for $23. This place is ridiculous . Its a shame , they have good potential but with their service and price range your better off dining in any of the restaurants with a much better overall dining experience .

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'Óxi to Avli - even tho my dish was inedible , the one star is simply based on the attitude of the manger that worked tonight - Friday 10/4/19. \\xa0When I complained to the waitress about my meal, moussaka, which I did not eat, I was handed the bill with the meal that I did not eat on it. I Explain to the waitress at the table that the meal should not have been served. It was clearly old. That tray should have been thrown away days ago. The bechamel was completely dried out, beyond over cooked and burnt. The potatoes were dried out, brown, disgusting ! I\\'ve had the dish at Avli several times before as well as other wonderful Greek Restaurants. It was never this horrible. On the way out I asked the waitress about taking it off the bill and the manager stepped in and said \"It was fine, \\xa0I tasted it\" . \\xa0REALLY ?!??? You\\'re questioning me? You\\'re telling me I should have eaten that old food? She tasted it????? \\xa0Did the manager taste from my plate???? Or did she taste from the tray???? Its impossible that she tasted it because the waitress said it was JUST NOW being discussed at their station away from the food area. \\xa0She would not have had time to go taste the food, from the time we spoke to the waitress to the time we got up to pay the bill. As a manager, it is VERY rude to question the opinion of the customer when it comes to a meal that was not eaten. JUST LOOK AT MY PICTURES POSTED. She then redid our bill and with attitude she said \"I took it off\". She was Very rude! I know what this dish is supposed to look like and taste like and it wasn\\'t it. Everything else was delicious. The appetizers, the lemon soup, the main course that everyone else had was on point. Our waitress Jen was wonderful and very attentive! My father was in the restaurant business at a very popular restaurant in Manhattan for over 40 years. I\\'ve heard plenty of stories growing up about \"the business\" . Perhaps the manager needs to go for some proper training. \\xa0Pictures speak a thousand words ...... you be the judge . \\xa0One last thing.... It truly disgusts me when a restaurant/chef thinks it\\'s OK to serve someone dried out, old food and expect them to eat it! Would they feed it to their family? Just look at the pictures below .....

Now I will talk about dinner. Food; Portuguese Octopus - octopus with jalapeno pesto, crispy nugget potatoes, and rocket arugula. The octopus was soft and we'll cooked. The jalapeno pesto was sour and refreshing and went extremely well with the octopus. I've dreamed of this since eating it. One of the best octopus dishes I have had in the city. Truffled Mac and Cheese - Mac and cheese and bechamel, wild mushrooms, garlic herb crumbs. Another great dish. Loved the truffle. Also one of the best Mac and Cheese dishes in the city.

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"My friend saw this place mentioned in a TimeOut article on best brunch places in Queens. We, group of 5, decided to try it for brunch. We ended up having a great time, satisfied with both the food and atmosphere. The only thing that was a slight negative was that since we were seated in the back, behind all the curtain tables, we couldn't see the live performers since the curtains were in the way. We got the brunch price fix at $17 which included drinks and a choice from egg based dishes, brick oven pizzas or paninis. Some dishes came with salad or potato cake. The food: I got the Breakfast Lox brick oven pizza. It was delicious and oh so filling. There was one egg in the middle of the pizza, I cut it open and let it run, and spread the egg yolk over all the slices of the pizza. The tomato was a good addition since it balanced some of the heaviness of the other ingredients. The portion size was great and I could barely finish the last few slices. It didn't come with any sides but since I was already unable to finish the whole thing I think the pizza itself was more than enough. The atmosphere: There's live brunch performance from noon to 3pm. There was a singer and someone that played an instrument. They were situated at the very beginning of the restaurant by the entrance door (not sure if thats the case each time). I sort of wished that they had taken down the curtains over the booths during brunch time so everyone in the restaurant could see the performers and get more light in from the windows and then they could put them back up for dinner time. We were sitting under small skylight windows so at least we got some natural light coming in (I prefer natural light during brunch), but maybe if you are sitting by the entrance there's more of it coming through the windows. The live music was soothing and even during intermissions they played pretty good songs over the speakers (mostly popular songs).The service: Pretty good and the server was attentive. Enjoyed brunch and would be open to coming back for dinner (I can definitely see how those booths with curtains could make for a pretty romantic or intimate ambiance during dinner time).\",\n",

There is live music, the service is great and the price is reasonable. This time, I came here on a Friday night for dinner and the food was just as delicious. We had the Portuguese Octopus and the Teres Major Steak. Even though the Octopus was on the appetizer menu, it is a decent sized portion to work as a main dish. It was tender and sizzled in your mouth. The steak came with sweet mash potato and asparagus hearts. It may seem strange to have something sweet with steak but it actually works in this case.

To drink, we ordered a bottle of the Californian Brut. It was a little on the sweet side, but not overwhelming. It was also refreshing for a warm day. To eat, we ordered the steak frites with peppercorn sauce. It took a little while to come out but it was awesome! The steak was juicy and seasoned well.The fries were hot and crunchy. I soaked up the excess peppercorn sauce with the slices of baguette they gave us. It was all so delicious.For dessert, we went with the famous French staple, the creme Brûlée.

Instead of apologizing they just asked if she \"was ok\" and then left. No apology. No offer to cover her dinner because she was now drenched in water and has wax all over her hand, face, and jacket (now ruined). When a waitress came to give us our food, we asked her to give our friend new silverware and glass because they were covered in wax. She gave us a glare and grabbed the items to replace. When we talked to the manager, the waiter came up to him, said something in French and they both chuckled. No real apology. When my friend came back from the bathroom, the waiter came and said that we were overreacting and that shit happens. THIS IS NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE!! He rose his voice at us and said that she can send him the invoice for the jacket (not sure if he will honor). Turned off at how he spoke to us, we left without even eating our food.

In addition, the waitstaff seemed totally disinterested: no one came over to explain the long wait for the food to appear or to to see if everything was okay during our meal.

They advertise margaritas for happy hour outside and Taco Tuesdays any taco 3 dollars each. We were the only people inside of the place. The waiter told us that the margaritas that were part of a happy hour were only the regular margaritas you weren't able to get any flavor margaritas. I had my heart set on a strawberry margarita so I had to pay full price for it which was I believe $12 each. I really didn't know what I wanted and when I was looking at the menu I wasn't too impressed because it seemed to be more of like a diner with some Mexican food. I was so indecisive. I also didn't like that they didn't even provide chips and salsa for the table like most mexican restaurants do.I finally just ordered a shrimp quesadilla. My friend ordered fish tacos. And my other friend ordered a chicken quesadilla.My shrimp quesadilla, how can I describe it? Well it definitely needed more flavor way too many onions and peppers. I like the fact that it had Oaxaca cheese. It also came with some guacamole Pico de gallo and a white sauce that definitely was not sour cream but looked more like ranch dressing. We did order guacamole for the table and it was quite a small portion but then again it was only $8. The guacamole itself you could tell it wasn't fresh it was super cold so you could tell it wasn't made to order and it needed to salt and some lime juice. The chips could have been heated they were probably out of a bag. One my friends fish tacos arrived, they smelled so good so I decided to order one of the fish tacos. I had one triangle of my shrimp quesadilla and then just ate the fish taco that I got. I took the other two pieces of quesadilla home. The fish taco was really good. The fish itself was fried crisp with a thin batter it had a cabbage slaw on top and a spicy smoky type of sauce on it that was very tasty. I kind of wish that's all I had gotten instead of the quesadilla, like I said before the quesadilla had too many onions and red peppers and they were big pieces and they seemed to be just sweated out a little bit before being placed into the quesadilla.The service was good, \\xa0place was clean but they should offer all margaritas for happy hour & at least provide complimentary chips & salsa and heat the chips!\",\n",

We were seated immediately and greeted with a warm smile from the employee there. There were many other customers who seemed to be regulars at this restaurant based on their interactions with the owner. The decor was very brick and mortar which was very different than what I was used to but it was refreshing. My bf and I waited a while for our food, but that was expected since we were warned in advanced that the food is made fresh so the wait would be a little long. Unfortunately, we only paid for the 1 hour street parking so we were a little worried that we wouldn't get the food in time. The food finally came after 20 or so minutes and boy, was it worth the wait. Our gyros were so fresh and the meat was so juicy that we finished them in less than 10 minutes. Next time, I will definitely have to bring more people so I can try out the combo platter. The table next to us ordered it and the aroma of their plate was moving throughout the restaurant. P.S.

The Bloody Mary had a great kick and the lemonade was refreshing. I had the Dutch baby with a side of pork apple sausage. Never had a Dutch baby before, was kind of like a doughy pancake. The top was crispy but inside soft, covered with butter and maple syrup. My boyfriend had the half fried chicken which was DELICIOUS, so crispy and tender. It didn't come with any sides though which I thought was a little strange. The honey carrot on the menu is actually a sauce. My friend had the steak & eggs, which was a huge portion. The steak was cooked to perfection and chimichurri was extremely flavorful. We shared the cheddar grits which were creamy and delicious.

I finally made the decision to drag T.H. out for a meal here just this past Sunday for Korean Thanksgiving (Chuseok). While the restaurant itself didn't have any particular specials for this holiday, the restaurant was still full and smelled great. We ended up as a party of 5 as a few of T.H.'s friends decided to tag along. We ordered the unmarinated beef combo, the pork combo, seafood soondubu, and a nengmyun (cold noodles). The unmarinated beef came with brisket, tongue, flank steak, short rib, and ribeye. Meanwhile the pork combo came with pork belly, pork jowl, and a pork chop served with grilled onions. I can definitely report that the meats were not only delicious but also were well cooked by the staff. They did a good job cracking jokes with us and making sure all our side dishes stayed replenished. Hilariously, our waiter kept on referring to the soju and beer as waters. Before each meat combo is cooked, they also bring it out and you can view the entire platter. The soondubu was flavorful and not too spicy. It also didn't give too much of the msg aftertaste and phlegm that I often get after eating at BCD. The seafood itself was fresh and the tofu was perfect. The nengmyun was made with arrowroot noodles instead of buckwheat which made them easier to eat though I missed the chewy texture. The broth for the nengmyun was a little sweet for my taste but like normal, the addition of mustard and vinegar went a long way to correct the flavor. So why only 4 stars? The food was delicious, the service was great. I like going a second time to confirm greatness! But also, I need to go and order some of the other dishes. Their website advertises that they make all their own broth and while I had a taste with the soondubu, I'd love to confirm its deliciousness with yukhwejang, seollongtang, etc. Until next time!\",\n",

All was well until we finished eating, and I asked for the check. I normally don\\'t scrutinize the bill when I\\'m at a restaurant, but this time I did because the server who went to retrieve my bill spent an extended period of time looking at the bill with another staff member (I assumed to be someone in management) before bringing it to me.

We were also charged for 7 bottles of Soju, when we only ordered and received 4 of them. I called the server over and asked about the discrepancies. As if annoyed by me questioning anything, they quickly took the bill and went back to the person they spoke with earlier. In Korean, the manager told the server (note: I\\'m American, but they didn\\'t know I speak Korean) to apologize for the miscount on the soju, but to tell us we got all the pork belly that was on the check.

I've had the Philly cheese steak and the sweet Italian sausage.The Philly cheese steak wasn't as oily as I'm used to. That could be either a good or bad thing, depending on how you look at it. It doesn't feel as unhealthy and you get the full flavor or the meat, but on the other hand, the lack of oil made it kinda dry but that can be fixed by adding ketchup or mustard to it.The sweet Italian sausage was juicy and sweet, as the name says. They also have a spicy version of this.Service is usually quick and even the small sized subs provide a good portion. They're cash only and there's no seating, unless you count the outdoor tables. You can stand by the counters at the window and eat your food, if you'd prefer to stay in the restaurant.\",\n",

Highlight of the evening was the chocolate-almond tartufo. \\xa0At least I *think* that\\'s what it was called....Here, let me explain: When we asked for the dessert menu (yeah the meal was not that great but it WAS Christmas Day, so why not have dessert)...we were told the restaurant doesn\\'t have a dessert menu and the waiter spouted off about 8 different dessert choices in about 1.2 seconds flat. \\xa0Add in a noisy restaurant and his mumbled voice, was not easy to catch them all. \\xa0He was quite annoyed when we politely asked if he could repeat them (there were 5 of us at the table). \\xa0So I had the tartufo but not sure if it was almond or hazelnut to be quite honest. \\xa0It was tasty though. \\xa0Sadly, a tartufo is not enough to bring me back, or, recommend this restaurant. \\xa0Quite a disappointment. \\xa0 Especially for a holiday meal.',\n",

Our party was so large that we had to sit at three different tables. The tables were in the same vicinity but split apart in a way that we were not able to converse with each other without getting up and visiting each table. I would have hoped that this would allow for better service but this was not the case. And being that we were such a large party I could see this as being overwhelming, but we walked in on a Saturday afternoon when there was barely anyone there. Not to say that anyone was mean or rude in any way. It's just we hardly saw the wait staff. It took FOREVER to get our drinks. And forget about getting refills...We only saw the wait staff when food was being brought to the table and being cleared away. Although some would have viewed the lack of interaction as giving us time to spend with our friends and family uninterrupted. But no ever checked in to see how we were doing, ever. On the flip side - the food was incredible. Let's start with the bread/garlic knots that were brought to the table. I am very particular with my garlic knots and these had just the right amount of garlic and oil that could soak up any plate of sauce (yes we did order another round just for that). Our apps included stuffed mushrooms and baked clams. A nice helping for each order and both equally delicious. The following course was a bowl of pasta with a sauce that could battle my mothers. My main dish was a tilapia oreganata. The fish was light and flaky and the sauce was not oily in the slightest. I would love to try this place with not such a large group in hopes that an intimate setting would grant me better service. \\xa0 I would love to grab a meal from them once more and maybe add another star to a future review.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'This place is great for boozy brunch - but that\\'s about it. Their bottomless brunch price is decent ($18 for 2 hrs - mimosas, Bellini, sangria, Bloody Mary). All of their main brunch dishes will be about ~$20. So if you\\'re going for boozy brunch and eating a full meal, expect to pay about ~$50 per person including tip (which I think is somewhat reasonable since you\\'re also drinking). However, this place has changed a LOT since it opened. I used to really like this place (outside of their brunch offer). But one time I went \\xa0in the evening and was told that coffee is not served after 7pm. Since when does a Greek cafe not serve coffee after 7pm? It\\'s pretty common that Greeks (and other Europeans) go out to cafes in the evening and drink coffee - why else would people go to a cafe if they can\\'t be served coffee?? \\xa0I thought that was pretty ridiculous and not sure why management would forego potential profits all because they don\\'t wanna serve coffee at night. Maybe they\\'re trying to not be seen as just a \"cafe\"? But even restaurants serve coffee with dessert after people have had their dinner so it just makes zero sense to me. Their dinner menu is okay, still think brunch has the most interesting/tasty dishes. But in all, the food is whatever. Another thing that really bugged me about this place is how expensive a glass of wine is! A friend of mine ordered a glass of wine and it came out to $15! She didn\\'t even order anything special either! I looked at the menu again and saw that pretty much all of their wines are $15!! Why so expensive? I understand that Astoria is hot right now and Ditmars is gaining some traction but we are not in Manhattan!!!

What made me give two stars, however, was the service. As the server brought our drinks he dropped a glass of sangria which fell on her lap and shattered everywhere on her and the floor. Thank goodness our dog was on my side or he would have been hit with shards of glass! We were quite calm about it; my mother and I work in the service industry and mistakes happen. The glass also got into our food and he quickly replaced it and apologized. But for such a large mistake to be made, no manager was around to do damage control of the situation and they didn't even comp the drinks or the food that was ruined. It might not seem like much but if my mother had made a scene I feel like a different reaction would have occurred. \\xa0Also while eating, we noticed people around us were frustrated of the slow service and how it took over 10 minutes to get simple drinks.This place has potential but lacks the fundamentals of customer service and it was quite dissapointing.\",\n",

Also comes with a delicious tea egg and pickled cucumbers.Gua bao (R2)- Pork belly buns. Again, the pork belly was delicious and literally melts in your mouth when you bite into it. The flavor of the peanut powder wasn't as pronounced as those I've had elsewhere though.Khong rou fan (R4)- Same as the Lu rou fan except the pork belly comes in thick slices instead of cut up pieces and there's also tofu as well.*Each rice dish came with a delicious radish soup on the side.I think Chimama's may have replaced Mama Lee's as my favorite Taiwanese restaurant in Bayside. While Chimama's menu items may be more limited, with classic Taiwanese dishes like 3 cup chicken, oyster pancake, etc. noticeably missing, the dishes that they do offer are prepared excellently. Not to mention that they have way more consistent hours and don't suddenly close and go on vacation for a couple of days. Prices are amazing.

Delicious flavorful, rich pork with just the right amount of fat and meat over perfectly cooked rice and a marinated egg. Oh and the pickled cucumbers add just the right amount of zest to the mix. I could eat this every day. And at their super low prices, I probably could! Of course I couldn't leave a taiwanese place without trying some popcorn chicken - no complaints there. Crispy and salty with the crispy basil leaves to go with it. And the service is excellente! The owners were so friendly and helpful when I went in to place my order. I'll be back, guaranteed.\",\n",

Most of the tables were occupied until I saw a couple moved from a 4 seater (I hate benches so uncomfortable). My mom's heart was set on Niu Rou Mian (Soup) but unfortunately, it was sold out so she went with Zhu Pai Mian (Soup) instead...I told the cashier to separate the pork because I hate soggy meat. She also ordered Lu Rou Fan (too much rice and not enough braised pork belly), Lu Niu Rou (cold appetizer)...small portion not worth $8...my mom makes it way better just saying, and Zhu Pai...ugh it was the same pork loin from the noodle soup...usually the staff would point it out but not the case for me tonight because I would've ordered something totally different. Damn the pork loin was three very thin slices ugh. The broth of the noodle soup was superbly bland and the pickled vegetable wasn't crispy but soggy. It's a small space so make sure someone grabs a table before the other person goes to order the food. This noodle spot is self-service so you order the food at the back counter then they called out your number to pick up your own food. As of June 1st, they only accepted CASH!!!

My order was really good (it was Toro tartar and a couple of sushi to try if I remember well) but my wife had a horrible experience. So based on that we cancelled the place from our LIC restaurant list.However this WE, we had family visit from Rochester and she insisted to have some sushi for lunch.So Just because it is around the corner and we had little wonder with us, we gave them another shot.The place is still really Zen, nothing too complicated but tasteful and warm. The water fountain even helped to keep Maxime calm for 10 minutes, that only is already for us a reason to love the place.So this time we made a kind of shared lunch that really turned into a tasting event.The Toro tartar was even better than the first time, the Toro sushi a dream, I was even lucky enough to get Uni sashimi that just have been fresh delivered. We tried the mussels and a bunch of other things, and each one was better than the other.The menu is really worth exploring and I was really feeling embarrassed to have been so negative after our first visit. The sake and wine list is really accessible.Once we got the check another nice surprise, it is really extremely reasonably price and even the items listed MP, were not overpriced.So it is really back on our toplist and surely a must try in LIC.Was this review ...?',\n",

We ordered the soft shell crab, broiled squid, salmon avocado roll, salmon skin roll, marble roll, and salmon sashimi (2 pieces per order). The fish was fresh and the rolls were pretty good. I expected the speciality roll (marble) to have been larger but for $10, it was a pretty decent roll. The salmon skin roll and salmon avocado roll were standard. The broiled squid appetizer came with this terayaki style sauce. The squid was slightly charred which I like but it was a little rubbery. It was probably over-cooked but I didn't mind it. The soft shell crab came with a garlic sauce but it overpowered the soft shell crab and made it soggy. It probably would have been better if the sauce came on the side. I probably wouldn't order this again. For dessert we got a scoop each of the green tea and red bean ice creams. The green tea was good and creamy but red bean wasn't good. It was icy and kept breaking apart in chunks so I think it had freezer burn. The next time I come back, I'm going to try their other desserts!The service was good - the waiters were very nice and kept refilling our waters and making sure we had everything we needed.I would recommend this place if you're looking for a no frills sushi restaurant.

You basically go to the back and fill your plate(s) and then pay. There is a separate bbq meat section that is charged a dollar more per pound if you choose to get it. Overall, the food is so good. There are a few things that are always present like the rice, beans, cornbread (my favorite), and a few others, but everything else gets switched up, which gives you more options when you come back. In the salad bar, you can make your own or they cycle the menu for pre-made salads, such as with a base of quinoa, arugula, collard greens, or kale. The salad tastes very fresh and I personally like majority of them, but my favorite would have to be arugula, apples, cranberries, sweetened pumpkin with a light dressing.As for the desserts, I love the flan and strawberry shortcake. Flan speaks for itself, but with the shortcake, each layer of cake is very moist and filled with flavor, not even dry in the slightest. Each slice is $4. The atmosphere is very calm, relaxing, and clean. There is no waiter so you find your own seat and clean up after yourself.

We did not make a reservation, but came in around 12pm, and were seated immediately. The restaurant around this time was rather empty, with only a few other tables of people. However, it filled up quickly. Between the three of us, we ordered five dishes, which I would say is too much food, as the food here mostly comes in large servings. We got one of the large bread dishes that was in a circular shape - I would say skip this, as it tasted like plain bread. Another dish I would recommend skipping is the nakhot garmack. It had a funny menu description, being described as a dish of veal that had the life boiled out of it, and was accompanied with chickpeas and sliced bread. However, it was quite tasteless and bland, and the soggy bread just made it all the more worse.The Samarkand summer salad was not bad, but nothing amazing. The standouts of the food here were the lagman soup, kebabs, and the Uzbek pilaf. The lagman soup had a thin, but flavorsome broth, with herbs that reminded us of Vietnamese pho in both taste and fragrance. I would love to eat this again if it was more accessible. The kebabs, especially the beef, were succulent and juicy. The lamb kebab did not taste quite right though. The Uzbek pilaf was a 5 star dish - with generous servings of meat, buttery rice, and vegetables, it was hearty and filled us up well on a cold day. The decor here transported us to Central Asia. All of the waitresses had heavy accents and were dressed in traditional clothing. Some did not speak English well. The service had been good while the restaurant was empty, but it became increasingly difficult to flag someone down when the restaurant got busier.  Value was great considering that the prices were very low, with large portions. Would recommend as worth the trip.',\n",

The salmon was drier and wasn't as pliable as I remember it being, I guessed it had been sitting there a while but this didn't bother me too much. Everything else was sub-par, definitely NOT worth the exorbitant prices! What DID bother me, warranting only a one star review was the hell I endured after a few hours of eating the salmon. The worst vomiting episodes I've ever had in my life, far worse than my bad morning sickness during pregnancy, I couldn't even keep water down! And with a pretty $12 price tag?! Are you freaking kidding me?! I can say without a doubt it was the salmon because I had nothing to eat yesterday previous to this chaos. It's common knowledge meats, especially seafood, are a breeding ground for bacteria when not properly prepared/cooked/stored with the proper food-handling etiquette. I could see that the salmon was cooked through so I can only saw they didn't keep the salmon warm at an acceptable temperature.Whilst from first glance the stall looks immaculate, obviously food safety standards are lacking.

Lastly, the Veal Don Peppe, (what drew us back here for 20+ years). The flavor and crust of the veal is awesome, but the veal itself was a bit tough.

Dim sum is good just the way it is.Be sure to ask if the dish is hot before you accept it off the cart, because we definitely got a lot of room temperature/cold dishes that have been sitting around for a while, which is not unusual at a dim sum restaurant. Definitely get the egg tarts, theirs are so so good.We were fortunate enough to book one of their private rooms, so we could be as loud as we wanted as we feasted to our hearts content.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Mar's deserves nothing less than four stars, but we also probably won't be back anytime soon given the prices.The atmosphere was rustic-romantic and comfortable and there was an eclectic mix of patrons, from groups of 30-somethings at the bar to significantly older couples/friends at tables. People were generally dressed smart casual but there were also people in sweatshirts, so it seems to that you can wear whatever you like and fit right in. There were a few hitches with the menu/service. A couple of things we tried to order from the menu were unavailable, and I was a little bummed that some of the items listed on the website were no longer being served. We ordered four different types of oysters from Prince Edward Island, but instead were given two of those and two varieties from VT and CT. That was fine, but as it turned out, the oysters from the U.S. were pretty bland.On the other hand, the alpine and sweet petite oysters from PEI were excellent. I felt like I was licking the ocean, and I mean that as a compliment.We also ordered the fish tacos and mushroom risotto. The fish tacos at $8 per piece were great, but pricey. The fish (cod) was melt-in-your-mouth and accompanied by subtle citrus flavors, juicy cabbage, and a citrusy-spicy creamy sauce. The corn taco wasn't dry like many of the taco shells I've had. The creamy mushroom risotto had a powerful truffle aroma, but the truffle flavor was just right. The risotto was cooked very nicely.I had two drinks: a cocktail and a glass of Bordeaux. I can't find the name of the cocktail anywhere but it was composed of bourbon, scotch, maple, orange bitters, and orange peel. It was simple but very good: smoke, sweetness, and citrus. We shared the chocolate ganache. It was very, very good. The dark chocolate and light crumbly cookie bottom were accompanied by sea salt, a caramel drizzle, and, amazingly, fried sprigs of rosemary. I believe tonight marks my first fried rosemary sprig. Finally, we ordered coffees, which were a bit burnt. All in all, we did order numerous items but still ended up with a $160 bill, which is just a bit more than the two of us want to pay for a typical night out on Astoria.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"The decor is nice enough but last night was one of the worst and overpriced meals I've had in a long time. The salad was the highlight, but $17 for a small, tiny, minuscule salad that include no meats cheese or any ingredient of high value felt like a complete robbery. The poutine ($14) was not good or even satisfying. The cheeseburger ($19) was well done, dense and lacking in any moisture or flavor. The must ask Who tops a burger with two cherry tomatoes? \\xa0Wtf?? \\xa0The chicken was tasty but a 1/2 breast with literally a few veggies for $22 is again robbery. Plus two glasses of wine and we ended the night at $105 + tip. Must be paying for ambiance cause Astoria has soooo many better options at this and far lower price points. Maybe we should have only ordered oysters. Argh\",\n",

The raw fish was really fresh and the prices were pretty reasonable (we both spent under $25 each including tip and tax) for 2 special rolls and 2 regular rolls - total of 28 nice sized pieces). The sushi rice seems well seasoned (not just plain white rice) and the seaweed they use for the rolls is higher quality than any sushi place I've been to in Forest Hills so far (and I've been to almost all of them).

Last time I came I ordered a draft Sapporo for 4 dollars, and the ramen + sushi roll combo for about 14. \\xa0Usually, I order the \"duet\" or \"trio\" sushi roll combo, which is 11 or 14 bucks depending on how many rolls you want.The space is great, I love sitting at the bar which is quiet and a perfect spot for a date or to have a solo dinner. The sushi rolls are of the best quality I have had in LIC/Astoria. Really tasty, fresh, and holds together well. The fish is also the right temperature and not too cold masking the flavor. The ramen was pretty good too. No broth choice, but that\\'s okay. The broth that comes with the ramen is somewhat sweet, but they provide some spicy chili oil that you can use to liven up the broth. The roast pork was super tender and fell apart in my chopsticks. The egg was over cooked unfortunately (hard boiled... I think soft boiled or medium is more traditional), but that was really my only complaint.Service is good. A tiny bit slow getting the check but that\\'s just because they don\\'t want to rush you out. \\xa0Other than that, they are friendly and happy to talk to you about the menu.

Quite an amazing meal that will leave you filled and satisfied.The Fajitas (a must is to have the steak and shrimp together) it's a little more for the two meats but WORTH EVERY PENNY PAID! The flavors are amazing and pair well with the traditional sides of tortillas rice beans and guacamole and sour cream!My other fave is the Steak!!! Man o man this dish right here is everything!! The steak is a perfect cut and cooked to your liking with the side of potatoes and a perfect sauce to pair everything together is the best!For those who are seeking to wet their whistle don't forget the Sangria (hands down the best) or a Michelada which they pair with your beer of choice!Overall a great place and as a client for more then 2 years it's been a great experience looking forward to see what Paloma's will put out next!!!\",\n",

The service was one of the best I've ever experienced!The Platter for 2 ($34) was larger in person than in photos. It's very filling for two people. The Lumpiang Shanghai (spring rolls) were so delicious, my mouth is watering just thinking about them! The rest of the food was amazing as well.The Cantaloupe Juice ($3) tasted just like fresh cantaloupe. It was pretty sugary, but not enough to stop me from drinking all of it.The Halo-Halo ($5.50) was good, it was the perfect way to end the meal.Everything was so authentic. I've never been to the Philippines, but the atmosphere made me feel like I was transported to another country. My cousin ate Filipino food at her friend's house multiple times and said this was truly authentic. Her Filipino friend was actually the person who recommended this place.I wish Queens wasn't so far away from me, but maybe it's for the best because I would probably go here once a week.\",\n",

So definitely come for those, not only do they have bbq but they have your typical Filipino food as well. Palabok pancit and sigsig. Definitely don't get shy when ordering a dish you have no idea about, I'm usually cautious but the food here is delicious ! Everything that comes out of that kitchen is just pure home-y Filipino cooking. I also heard that the avocado smash(?) or slushy was famous. They give you a purée avocado mixture with condensed and shaved ice. You mix the whole thing yourself which is kinda fun especially for kids. But the drink itself isn't too sweet but just enough to taste the avocado flavor and not overpowering it.\",\n",

The taste is as good as the look of the Platter of 2, cute and vibrant, layers of flavors just popped in your mouth. I'm so glad we went with their recommendations! Guessing the ingredients can also be good conversational topics (date tip here, again!) Happiness in this restaurant is contagious. You can tell how happy everyone here is while enjoying the foods & drinks. The waiters here are by far the kindest ones I've encountered in New York, the experience is absolutely wonderful. Next time when you pass by this area, don't hesitate, walk straight from that normal entrance and head upstairs to enjoy this authentic Philippine culinary experience!

The funny thing was she remembered exact subtotal amount of food price we had and showed us calculation that we paid lower than 15% tip. (She calculated from grand total, not food price before tax, from which we normally calculated the tip.) She felt so upset and complained us in the cafe for almost 5 min. This manner totally ruined every normal to good thing about this restaurant.I believe that tip is a gratitude. It's NOT a requirement by law or necessary to pay if you don't appreciate. This waitress just provide lower to normal standard of service, e.g., not smile, monotone when she talked to customers, not ask us anything after all food is served. Nothing is impressive on their service. How could she expect us to give her 18% tip? This restaurant received cash only. No credit card fee the restaurant must subsidize.

The food came pretty quick, which was great. We had ordered some wine as well but it never came. We only saw the waitress twice throughout this whole experience. Once, when she took our order. The second time was when we had to flag her down for the check. We practically had to beg. We had thought that she'd at least eventually come check up on us. When she never came, we even stacked the empty plates and cups in the middle as a cue. She was helping the tables beside us but didn't bother to turn her head and ask us if everything was fine? At that point the place was mostly cleared out so we figured we'd at least get OK service. That was too much to ask for.Anyway, we had to tell her that we never got our wine and that we'd like it stricken from the check.

After experiencing places like Spot Dessert and Prince Tea House, my tooth had converted from savory to sweet.I first experience at Prince Tea House was in Sunset Park. I remembered feeling as if I was waiting for Queen Elizabeth to appear from the back. The decor is very elegant with Lenox style dinnerware and an extensive drink and dessert menu. I remembered the service was attentive and the food/drink met my expectations. So when I visited the Flushing and Astoria location, I wondered if it would meet my expectations from the first visit. For me, the service and food was very similar at all of those locations. In this case, having the consistency at all the locations was a huge plus. This location may be the closest late night (open until midnight) dessert spot in the area that is reachable by subway. This particular time, after hours of fighting the urge, we arrived at 11:40pm. Needless to say, we were the last ones there and still the service was very attentive and did not rush us at all. We ordered the potted caramel tea and the coconut panna cotta, which came out with the same look feel and taste as always. We did end up leaving a few minutes before midnight (fast eating), and they did close the doors right afterwards. Just the fact that they served us and didn't give us any grief or emit negative energy, I keep this place as a must visit for all you dessert fans.\",\n",

It's only a dollar change but charging my card more than I authorized is NOT Okay! Their AC was broken and we sucked it up in this heat and we didn't complain but to go this far is not right!

Of course when the bill came, it was $28 for the standard 2 tentacles. It did taste good though.Lamb chop special of the day a shocking $42!The Garidopilafo curried shrimp sounded amazing but tasted uninspiring, partly because the rice was tastier than the shrimp.

I really appreciated the ventilation and how spacious the seating was compared to other korean BBQ places I've been to. Naturally you're still going to come out smelling like KBBQ smoke but the air is far less dense in O2 than at other places I've tried. This is a huge plus IMO because if you're going to an AYCE KBBQ place, you're probably already going to have difficulty breathing if you're doing it right. The ventilation and space in O2 makes your life markedly easier.Service was excellent. Easily the best service I've had at a KBBQ place. The server was extremely friendly, prompt, responsive, and made good recommendations for which cuts to try and ways to dress each cut (sauces, radish, etc). She was also a very clear communicator, which is kind of a rarity.The meats however, didn't feel as good as Cast Iron or non-AYCE places. They're still decent to above-average, and the marinade is right, but the mouthfeel for the top blade/kalbi had less 'bite.' Could just be this one time -- I'm definitely coming back to try it again.So one corollary to the excellent service was that they brought out everything extremely quickly. Once the cooked meats were 60% eaten, the new batch of meat was brought out. Which meant that we were stuffing ourselves at a rapid pace. We ordered 5 different things from the jump, and we were already finished with those 5 orders within 30 minutes. I'd recommend pacing yourself to maximize the experience and food. That would also mitigate cross-contamination from the raw meat which drips to the cooked meats which are 'lower' on the pot. A way to avoid this would be to collect all of the cooked meats onto your bowl, but I personally prefer keeping the meat warmer. To be clear, that's not a mark against O2 -- just something to keep in mind when you enjoy yourself here.\",\n",

When they received the check a 20% gratuity was added on the check. All the other receipts posted by others on yelp do not show this charge. It also does not specify on their menu that there was such a charge, even for larger groups. AND this is not a Jean George or Nobu, they should not be charging any automatic tip of 20%, or in this case even more.Firstly, if they even specified that they would charge the gratuity, it should not be 20% on the total, including taxes. Tip is correctly calculated on only what is ordered and should exclude the tax, as no service was provided for the tax. Secondly, this establishment has discriminated against a group of young people, as I could only concluded that they felt it was alright to assume that 'these kids' will not pay any gratuity, so then it would be acceptable to CHEAT them of additional money by adding on a gratuity charge that is too high.

Damn near $50 for a small handful of dishes. Taste is just okay. Another time we arrive at 9-9:30AM and there was only two people dining in the restaurant. Came in with a double tandem stroller that's easily collapsible. They asked us to leave the stroller by the entrance. Since it was empty, we asked if we could close it up by the table (that way its not in the way of the carts but still have our stuff nearby) but they said no. It's EMPTY so we decided to leave. Didn't feel welcome or family friendly. So disappointing because we did like this spot. Oh well.\",\n",

Not sure what happened but it started going downhill. So let me talk about the food first. It's pretty average for a pokebowl place. I prefer the rolls more since the bowl doesn't have as many toppings as other poke places. They also started charging more for avocado, which is fine and understandable. Their station use to be really clean, where the guys would wipe it down very often. Today, on a monday, during lunch, it looked like a mess and not everything was prepped yet. Not to mention they didn't have some items such as nori and shrimp? it's a freaken Monday and you're operating a restaurant with minimal ingredients for crying out loud. Okay, so lets get into the service. My usual encounters were with the guys that worked there. They were great, nice, and have a happy face and greeted you well. They def made the ordering process fun and enjoyable. They made THIS place seem like a fun enjoyable place to chill and get food from. So the question is, where are these great guys??? Today I was greeted by a pretty rude condescending female. Lets just say, this girl was the worse. If you had a happy morning, she'll bring you down with her. She was so rude and moody like as if the world owed her something. Before, the ordering process was you just pick what you want in your bowl, as they put it in, which was what I was use to. I guess now, you just have to tell them every ingredient you want and pay first. She didn't bother to tell me of course, instead she just stood there rolling her eyes silently.. which was awesome. Got my mood going. Then, I forgot what some of the ingredients were, so I asked to clarify, and she would do an undertone sigh and aggressively tell me what it'd be. It's like dude, if you hate your job esp in customer service, just quit. nobody is holding a gun to your head to make you do this. I don't understand this hostile attitude. As we left, my bf told me, he should have warned me beforehand. He mentioned whenever he went, there'd be 2 girls who would have this awful attitude. The guys are great and nice, but the girls are horrible with customer service. Anyways Kissfish, if you want to maintain better service, I'd advise you to retrain some of your employees. This def put a sour taste to my experience so not sure if I'd wanna come back. I don't think anyone wants to go to a place where they're paying to just get a quick bite, and end up leaving feeling disrespected and irritated. You guys have been warned. Put on thick skin if you're being greeted by the females there.\",\n",

Luckily the staff here was extremely accommodating and understanding. We placed our order ahead of time, and they waited to cook/serve our food at the appropriate time.For appetizers we split the Kale Pakoda. And for entrees, we did family-style and ordered the Lamb Chops, Butter Chicken, Chicken Biryani, and Saag Paneer. Normally I don't go crazy for Lamb Chops (or lamb in general as depending on how its cooked, has a slight aftertaste) but the lamb chops here are amazing! They were seasoned and cooked perfectly. We also got a side of the cheese naan that was spicy (but soo good). Most of the dishes ended up being pretty spicy (which is expected), but everything was so tasty. My two recommendations are definitely the cheese naan and the lamb chops. My other two friends absolutely loved the Kale Pakoda - it was really good, but I wasn't crazy over it. Adda definitely has something right going on for them: their food is extremely tasty and fresh.

Would give it 4.5 stars. Loved the music, the decor, the vibe, and the food was great too! A cool spot for a date or just to hang out. The food is well-priced and they serve big portions. The nepalese/himalayan entrees actually come out pretty quickly - it's just the momos that took maybe 15-20 mins.My only gripe are these aren't the best veggie momos I have ever had.

The food was incredible, and I particularly enjoyed that since this was ACYE, we were able to get the exact portion of meat we wanted (ex: two slices of pork belly rather than a whole plate as it's served in other places) because then we wouldn't need to pay extra for food wasted.The buffet bar with the meats, sauce, rice, and prepared hot foods was continuously stocked throughout the night. The prepared hot food bar had rotating items like two types of chicken wings, bak Choy, scallion pancakes, dumplings, rice, and different types of soup.The meat section had a bunch of different marinated meats, both spicy and non spicy. Our favorites were the marinated kalbi beef short ribs of course! They also had interesting items like spicy pork skin which was very crunchy when cooked.To top it off, we got free ice creams at the end!Overall, This place is great and if you pay with cash you get $3 off per person!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I know Picnic Garden is one of the OG AYCE KBBQ places - it has seen a move to its current larger space due to its popularity (I never went to the original location). Despite only giving three stars I had a pretty good experience here, but the reality is that there is newer competition out there and I like their way of doing things better.PG is a bit more expensive than other AYCE KBBQ places I have been to, but for the extra money their buffet selection is more extensive adding cooked dishes and a little more variety. That is also another issue - it's a buffet. A buffet of raw meat that is sitting out, people are walking around with plates full of raw meat. Raw meat and its juices just all over the place. I'm just not the biggest fan of eating on the same table with raw meat (can I say raw meat one more time? probably). I like other places such as Cast Iron and O2 where the wait staff put the meat directly onto the grill. The galbi was the most popular item with the group I went with and myself - nicely marinated and delicious. The service was very attentive as well - clearing the table, changing the grill, cooking and cutting the meat.Overall I think you will have a good to great experience here, the food and variety is good for the money. I would even come back if friends wanted to eat here, but for the issues explained above and better options available elsewhere makes PG only A-OK in my book.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Picnic is an OG KBBQ spot in the Flushing, Queens area. I remember going there back in middle school, especially during their cheap (cheap!!) lunch hours. The place has moved locations to a much bigger space and nicer interior, but the setup is pretty much the same. You have the buffet spread in the middle of the restaurant stocked with anything from galbi to kitchen-made ddukbokki. This spread hasn't changed much at all because they still have those sushi rolls (never tried, but they've always had this ever since I started going there). The grills are the same too, the silver metal grills.Picnic Garden's food is honestly pretty much like it used to be, but with a slight upgrade. I remember in the past they had frozen pork belly put out at the buffet. Their meat selection is larger than it used to be, which is pretty nice. I can't really complain about the food or the taste. It's standard for KBBQ, but as you probably know, the competition for KBBQ in the area is huge with spots like Cast Iron Pot and O2. Their grilling styles are obviously very different. The only annoying thing I have to point out about Picnic Garden is how fast the meat burns. I used to think that I was just young and dumb \\xa0and did not know how to properly grill meat. Better burnt than raw pork right? But after going to places like their competitors, I don't ever have burnt meat like I do at Picnic Garden. I'm not saying it's the restaurant's fault at all, but rather that it's hard to really have conversation as the meat cooks because sometimes you forget, and before you know it, the meat is burnt black. I get you can just move it off the grill and onto a plate, but maybe because I'm used to KBBQ grills where you can move the meat to the edge where it can keep it warm because the fire doesn't concentrate around the edges. That's my only real concern about Picnic Garden. I wouldn't voluntarily suggest to go here anymore because of this burning thing, but it was nice to revisit and take a trip down memory lane. Maybe I'll come back with some friends in the future, not sure, but we'll see! (Also, the prices here for dinner are more expensive than the other KBBQ places I go to now before tip and tax.)\",\n",

Ventilation has gotten bad. Service was non existent. I got a knife to cut my own meat. Puddles of water near the meat area. My favorite marinated short ribs had no taste. The meat was tough. Hot food section looked sparse. Chicken wings, string beans,dumplings and corn. The string beans were not trimmed. The people are happy and giddy to get a table after a long wait They don't see the dirty plates or taste the tough meat or care about the bad service.

But yesterday I came and I was unexpectedly shocked by this. Our basket of lettuce contains a large bug/fly in between one of the veggies. Its one thing to find hair but to find a bug bigger than my pinky nail. It was utterly disgusting. It wasn't even a small bug. It was big enough for me to see from a distance. Not only that, but I ate most of the veggies from that basket before we realized the last one had been contaminated. GROSS. It's obvious whoever cleaned the lettuce didn't clean it properly. They probably just rinsed it under the water and that's all. We brought the managers attention to it and he offered half price for one person. But still.

It's reminiscent of a Philly cheesesteak, but with a touch of Korean-bulgogi-ness to it along with a nice portion of semi-spicy cherry peppers chopped up into the sandwich (reminds me of the cherry peppers that Shake Shack uses). The meat is very tender, juicy, and flavorful, and the juices in the sandwich will drip down your hands if you're not careful. I can honestly say it's the best sandwich I've had in a while.I ordered delivery, and it took about 35 minutes, which was under the estimate, and the food arrived very fresh and still hot. The smallish fried dumplings were very crunchy, and even the crinkle-cut fries were still relatively crisp...or as crisp as crinkle-cut fries that were delivered can be. My two cents is that the fries are a pass (I only ordered them to make the $15 minimum) and the dumplings are okay but not mind-blowing, so just order 2 of the sandwiches and save one for later. ;)\",\n",

They start off with salad and the ginger dressing and a side of kimchi. I can eat salad all day if I had this dressing. Kimchi has a kick to it but it's not that spicy. Our dishes! The kalbi is marinated on the lighter side! It surprisingly makes you crave for more. The combo order comes with 6-7 pieces of kalbi. The soondubu is also yummy and they're generous with the seafood. We also tried the soy garlic wings and they were delicious! The chicken took a lot longer than the other dishes but it was okay since it gave us time to digest our food haha.

Sometimes if my friends and I are craving Korean food late at night or if someone comes home from a trip late, Tang is always an option for us. We\\'ve been going to Tang for years now, way before they started added new things on the menu. Their mixed pancake platter is great. I remember the flavor always being on point and the pancake was crispy. Their jokbal naengchae is also great and super refreshing! Honestly, their jokbal is a highlight for me and my friends. We always devour the dish so quickly because of how tender and not overly salty it is. Their soondaeguk is definitely one of my favorites because it isn\\'t too salty like I\\'ve had at other places. The soup is rich and has so many pieces of soondae! Love mixing it with their radish kimchi as well! It\\'s such a great balance when combined. I\\'ve gotten plenty of their sets as well and they\\'re all good, nothing much to say. It\\'s all pretty standard. Their Chilean sea bass can be a hit or miss depending on the cut of the fish you get. Sometimes it can be super fatty and salty and sometimes it\\'s perfect and tons of meat. I feel like it\\'s a little bit of luck needed here. The flavors are definitely heavy on the fish where I normally wouldn\\'t go for it, but albeit, my friends love it. The only thing I didn\\'t like was their soondubu because it\\'s not that flavor I\\'m used to and it\\'s a bit watery? The flavors are also not very deep, but I never go to Tang for their soondubu. I love that they serve salad first for free because salad is a great starter especially if you\\'re eating a heavy meal. I learned this trick from watching a korean mukbang Star that said he always ate salad first to \"open up the stomach and build a foundation\". Great starter! I also enjoy their radish kimchi cause it\\'s super crunchy, but they don\\'t give that much (usually hidden under the kimchi), so you\\'ll have to ask for more.I\\'ve always had a pleasant experience whenever I came!

My friends and I all couldn't read it and then thankfully, a waiter emerged out of no where and brought us to an available table. The couches are covered in a strange cloth. The table comes with a saffron tea. The wooden chairs on the other side of the couch were surprisingly very comfortable. This is definitely a Chinese, family-style restaurant. There's delicious free bubble tea with your Yelp check-in. The bubbles aren't regular chewy bubbles. The texture of these are closer to grass jelly and aren't sticky at all. I like them better. The quality of the milk tea is good too.For lunch, we ordered a cold century egg dish with a delicious garlic sauce & scallions, shovel chicken with numbing corn peppers and a ton of spicy peppers, pork belly with pickled vegetables under, and steamed egg white with ground meat on top. All of these were very good over rice. All the flavors were very different from what Cantonese cooking has. My favorite dish was the century egg dish. The sauce in the center is so good over rice.

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"We came here on a reservation as a loud, hyped up, food-crazy Filipino party of 10. I think I've had slightly better Malaysian food in the past, but this place almost has it all, and I thought they did a wonderful job handling us.Given the large selection of food on the menu, the ordering process is very easy- you're given a little slip of paper to write down numbers corresponding to the menu items and desired quantities = less social interaction for me yayyy lol jk. The menu is very visual, like a huge colorful children's picture book of food, so it's very easy to see and expect what you're ordering. Upon handing our waiter the slip, it seemed like she had memorized and was able to recognize some of the numbers/items. She ensured that all of our food came out in the desired order, like if we wanted the dessert to come out along with all the food or after the meal.I ordered two drinks because I couldn't help myself- the 3-layer rose syrup milk tea and the lychee cincau. Both were excellent and came with grass jelly, my favorite! The rose milk tea was perfectly sweet and the lychee cincau was like a melted lychee slushy with actual lychee in it, which was super refreshing while I had some of the spicier foods. For apps we started with the mixed chicken/beef satay skewers and the roti canai. The satay was just okay, a bit too dry for me, but the peanut sauce compensated for the texture. The roti was delicious, soft yet crisp, and came with 3 different sauces. Those two went very quickly.While the rest of our table shared dishes family-style, I ordered my own entree, which was the nasi lemak, a staple Malaysian dish with coconut rice, sambal (chili) shrimp, curry chicken, peanuts, anchovies, and a hard boiled egg. I thought it was pretty decent; all the components blended together nicely. Funny story...my mom accidentally spilled a glass of water on my nasi lemak, but the waitress was kind enough to transfer the untouched parts of the dish onto a new plate and give a replacement cup of coconut rice. I was also able to have a taste of the steamed hainan chicken - very flavorful - and the lamb, which was thoroughly cooked and had a pretty strong kick to it. All of us really enjoyed the food!As promised, my pre-ordered dessert was ready right as I finished my entree. I ordered cendol, caramelized coconut milk-flavored shaved ice with wormlike green jellies and sweet beans at the bottom. It is certainly a shareable dish after stuffing oneself with all of that food. The proportion of flavoring to shaved ice was perfect- sometimes I get shaved ice with too much or too little flavoring so the dessert is too concentrated or diluted, but fortunately that wasn't the case here. The place gets very busy around dinner time as most Flushing restaurants, but the service manages to keep on top of it all despite the bustle. The restaurant is well-maintained and clean. Definitely come here if you're looking to try Malaysian food for the first time or just want to satisfy a craving!\",\n",

We never asked for extra spice, and the menu didn't state it but just something to be aware of if you aren't a huge spicy food lover. The drinks were nice. Sangria was good, and margarita on the rocks was also very good. Another friend got a frozen margarita and that was overpoweringly sweet. Stick to on the rocks!

The chocolate is pretty cool looking but the chocolate tastes like dark chocolate and I prefer milk. The pastries were okay, typical buffet pastries. They had frozen yogurt in vanilla and mango flavor. It was a bit watery. I also got a crepe. I think they overcooked it because when I started to eat it it was crispy, and I know that crepes aren't supposed to be so crispy that they start to break into pieces. There was also cotton candy.

In fact, each individual piece of maki, nigiri, and sashimi was smaller than they are everywhere else. The side salad came with sauce (ginger I think) and was probably the best plain salad I've had at a sushi place, but it's hard to get excited about a plain salad side. The option to get a side of rice or something else instead would have been nice. The gyoza was good, but it was slightly bland.

Be sure to make reservations, and dress to impress because the evening atmosphere will call for it. They dim the lights a bit too much, but their menus have LED backlights and the staff will provide additional candles upon request.As far as food and drink goes, everything I've tried here has been very good - but I especially recommend the seafood paella and pernil. My brother is vegan and I appreciate that they offer a meatless pollo a la plancha, as well. Valet parking can be a little slow on the way out, but it's easier than trying to find a spot in this part of LIC.

When she returned with our wine, we had only received 2 glasses. Informed her that we just need one more glass of wine and with an unpleasant gesture she stated that she will bring the other glass once my dad came in from parking.

The food here is average at best and the service needs a little work.We went in and waited to be greeted by a hostess, anybody really, but no one paid us any mind. When a wait staff finally came around, we told him we were a party of 4 and was told that he'd be right with us. Then, the lady at the front noticed us waiting and asked if we had put down a name, which the guy before failed to take. She went on to take out name down but in the meantime sat a party of 8 who came in after us. The mishap was quite annoying, especially since we now had to wait. Nonetheless, I wouldn't have even minded that if the food was exceptional, but it wasn't. The broth to the pho lacked the deep rich beef flavor you'd expect from Pho, the crispy egg rolls were under done with some of the rice paper were still a bit sticky on the inside. The pork in the bahn mi were pounded out so thin that you couldn't taste the pork itself and was missing the mouth feel of having charred \\xa0meat in a sandwich. I was also upset that they didn't even use a proper baguette, where it's super flaky and crispy on the outside and soft and chewy on the inside. Instead, they had the bahn mi on an Italian hero. The pork had no chance with a bread like that!

(Also, as an aside, I just realized that this would be my 700th review, and it's a shame that it's going to be a pretty bad one).My mother, myself, and my boyfriend came in at around 7PM earlier tonight, and the place was packed, which we took as a good sign. Looked like there weren't any tables available, so when the hostess asked how big our party, we told her, and then... she disappeared. Didn't mention that there would be a wait, or how long the wait would be, etc. We ended up speaking to another staff member, who honestly would've made a better hostess, who did put us down on a waitlist and then shortly afterwards, got us seated.Our server comes by not long after and we place our order. The bf ended up getting a grilled pork with rice dish, my mom got one of their phos, and I ordered their Chinese broccoli dish. The bf and I also ordered some drinks, and then our server went away to put in our order. About five minutes later, she comes back to tell us that one of the drinks weren't available, which should've been a sign for what was to come.The bf's food comes first, and I told him to go ahead and start eating. Then, my mom's dish comes out, and she goes ahead and starts eating as well. I figured my dish was just going to take longer, so I waited. And waited. By now, both my bf and my mother have finished their meals, so I've waited about 30 minutes at this point. Oh, and at this time was when our drinks came in, too. Finally, we flag down our server, and we tell her that my food had never come. She goes to check with the kitchen, comes back, and tells me that they didn't have my dish anymore and if I wanted to order something else. I'm pretty livid at this point. She never came by before to mention that my dish was out, which makes me think she had never put it in. She had also never once come by our table to ask how our meal was, to refill our water glasses, etc. I had completely lost my appetite at this point and wanted to just leave, so I just asked for the check. I made sure that my item wasn't on the bill, and at least that was correct. I figured this would be the end of the snafus for the night.But of course, somehow, this place seemed to have one more disappointment hidden away up its sleeve because when we got our check back, I had received somebody else's card and receipt. Basically, everything you could imagine going wrong by dining out at a restaurant went wrong tonight.I get that this place is new and the kitchen and FOH staff clearly doesn't have its shit together, but the horrible service we had received here largely overshadowed the quality of the meal. The only thing I had managed to try was their soda with egg yolk and condensed milk, and that was okay, but honestly, I never want to come back here again after tonight. Caveat emptor.\"},\n",

I also hoped that maybe they've fixed them since their last inspection which was in July. It was busy as you would expect on a Friday night but there was no wait. I'm assuming it's because as we experienced the service is fast. We were seated and brought over some tea and nuts. The waiter wasn't friendly but not rude either. We knew we wanted seafood so that made it easy to narrow it down with all the options they have. We skipped appetizers. My friend ordered the Jumbo Hong Kong Shrimp and myself the Jumbo Shrimp with Walnuts and mayonnaise sauce which I've had elsewhere. We also ordered a side of Young Chow fried rice( included egg, ham, shrimp, scallions).While we waited for our food we wanted wine. I guess it's a Flushing thing because they only serve wine by the bottle and we didnt want beer again so no dranks for us. In an eye dream of jeannie head nod our food came. At first glance I knew I wasn't going to finish it all. The portions are big. To make this simple the food is good and solid. Both shrimp dishes were fried but not greasy. The mayo sauce wasn't too sweet. The atmosphere had good vibes. We didn't feel out of place. The place was clean.

Here, there was no sizzling at all, and the places where the meat touched the plate weren't even charred.

There are a ton of good looking things for selection. The standard order here is $9.00 for a plate of rice and two sides, or $9.50 for a plate of rice and three sides. For my sides, I got the ground pork, the garlic pork, and the fish stew/curry. I also got an iced thai coffee, and the 2 pork ball skewers for $5.Well, they certainly weren't kidding with the spiciness of the fish stew. It doesn't start off too bad, but it gets super hot as you keep eating it. I actually wasn't wild about the taste, but this is probably the first sufficiently spicy thing I've eaten since coming to America (aside from eating ghost pepper hot sauce straight from the bottle). The ground pork has slight spice, though very nice overall. I thought the garlic pork was great, as were the pork balls.

It was a little more crowded on this day, but I was still able to get a seat at the table. I tried one new item this time, and while it was good, I think I'll try something else next time. It was the chicken curry. One suggestion I might make is that they should consider using boneless meat instead of the bone stuff, since my pieces of chicken hardly had any meat on them. Still, using bone in pieces of meat is the asian way, so I'm not sure this will change in the near future.The spice levels here are kind of odd actually. I believe the color of the item name is supposed to correlate with the heat level (green: not spicy, yellow: medium, orange: very spicy). The problem is that some of the items with the orange label aren't spicy at all, like the curry chicken. An order of one item costs $10.60 (kind of a strange price), in case you were wondering.

I absolutely love that they provide you with a plastic bib and gloves because you get very hands-on when eating crawfish. The gloves don't entirely prevent your hands from getting dirty, but they definitely protect your hands from the worst of it. They even have the table protected with a plastic sheet so don't be afraid to get messy. I got so eager to get ready in my new gear that I forgot to take photos.I usually go for 2lbs of crawfish ($15/lb) so I can get a free corn and potato. But corn and potato are both quite cheap to add into your boil if you don't wanna spend so much on crawfish. This time I got 1lb crawfish in the Juicy Cajun flavor, medium spicy. The sauce is yummy: not too thick and not too watery. The corn and potato marinated in the sauce is delicious.We also got a fried catfish basket to share. The catfish was very light and almost fluffy on the inside with a nice crisp exterior. It came with a basket of Cajun fries which were also nicely seasoned.\",\n",

You see Asian people stumbling by to go to the elevators or the bathroom or what have you.With that said, what a gem! I always get the drool- hot n juicy medium spice with Cajun calamari. Medium spice seems to be a good balance of spice and flavor for someone who eats Asian spice. I've gone a handful of times and when it's really good it's top notch, hands down 5 stars. The first time I went the waitress was telling us the crawfish are fresh/live prior to serving, which is a plus.If I can, I would give hot n juicy 4.5 stars cause their sauce is to die for BUT I do have to say, it can be inconsistent. Ive had it too salty, too spicy--even the Cajun seasoning on the calamari has been inconsistent whether there wasn't enough seasoning or too much.

The glaze was described as passion fruit, but I am pretty sure there were just strawberries (kinda a disappointment after waiting for such a long time). The other part of this I think could be improved is the ice cream. It was overly frozen and had the texture of ice crystals. While this was an overall good attempt, it was not work the $13 menu price.- Limited parking - what else is new on Bell Blvd?- Generally overpriced for the quality.

The octopus was good but not remarkable. Both rice bowls came with shishito peppers, which were the spiciest shishitos I've eaten--they were spicier than a jalapeño! They were so spicy that the table next to us commented about them to the waitress! To be honest for a place that services sushi and other raw fish, I was a little surprised that the tuna wasn't a little more flavorful. The avocado bowl though was delicious, especially the tempura avocado! In general, the meal was good but expensive for a casual atmosphere and basic rice bowls. \\xa0I'd definitely consider this place for a casual lunch or quick breakfast pastries, but in general the experience and food itself didn't warrant the prices.\",\n",

I've never felt like it was a real izakaya place, where you can get an abundant of skewers or small little dishes. Their portions are usually big and expensive. They also have an tasting menu I've never tried but it looks worth it. I've had a numbers of their ramens but nothing where I craved over and over. The cilantro ramen is a bit tasteless and weird but others do like it. The ban ban chicken is okay. The goma miso is probably the best one with the heartiest broth. I've heard great things about the Hawaiian poke. The miso crusted wings with peanut is salty and feels heavy but tastes good. I've had few cravings for this place but would be worth to give other items a try.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"We had an interesting dinner here. My husband, sister and father treated my son to dinner here this past weekend to celebrate his 21st birthday. I've encouraged him to pick a cuisine that interests him and I do the leg work of finding a place that can execute it well so he has a good experience that's different every time. This time, though, I picked the cuisine and went with something along the lines of Middle Eastern.Because he's on campus in Long Island with a ton of work to complete, he just came for the night. I actually made reservations for an Egyptian spot down the block but we also had the baby in tow and the place we reserved was far too small for us to fit the stroller. The owner of that establishment directed us to Mombar, another Egyptian eatery, because the size would accommodate us and the owner, Mustafa, is family.Luckily, when we arrived, there was no wait. It's very small but they fit as many tables as possible in the space. There's an open kitchen and the decor and layout makes you feel as though you're dining in someone's home. Upon first impressions, it seems cluttered but I choose to see it as eclectic and authentic. We were able to squeeze out stroller in between tables but would have probably had a more difficult time had they been busier.This is not a place where y be grabbing a bite and running out. If you come here, be prepared to take your time, slow down and really enjoy your meal, company and the ambience. Mustafa is also the chef, host and server so it's expected that there will be somewhat of a wait while all of the tables are being served.Grub Rundown:Lamb Cheeks - so tender and not gamey, seasoned nicely and served with warm pita. A must have!Sahara Mix - Babaganoush, Hummus and Fool, served with warm pita and a heavy dose of olive oil. Great for sharing and tasty.Be-Sara - Fava Bean spread, served with warm pita and so very good.Lamb Shank Special - covered in spinach and served with your choice of couscous or rice (get the couscous) which has fruit cooked in. Flavorful and spiced well. I loved it and the portion is enough for two meals.Lamb Chops - these were only ok to me. My son ordered and I tasted. He enjoyed it better than I.Steak - hubby ordered this. It tasted really good and was serve with veggies.Whole Striped Bass - my dad ordered this and loved it. He finished the entire platter. Yes. Platter. The fish was prepared for him and deboned so all he had to do was put fork to mouth.Lamb Tagine - my sister had this entrée and enjoyed it very much as it was also served with couscous.The spice situation here is on point! All of the food was really good. We enjoyed everything. They have some items for the adventurous eater such as, rabbit, lamb brains, tongue and testicle, but we kept it pretty neutral. I love rabbit but I didn't want to try at an unknown restaurant and apparently, their duck is a hot ticket item because they were sold out by the time we arrived.While I don't think I'd venture out to dine here again just because of geography, it's certainly worth a visit. The owner was so amazingly attentive to each and every patron and there were even a few regulars that came in to dine. Those kinds of diners are always a sign that you've stumbled upon a good thing, a hidden gem.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"This worth checking out as a cultural experience and maybe slightly less so as a dining experience. The chef-owner is also an artist and craftsman whose work includes the intricate inlaid table tops, ceiling, floor, and densely curated objects on the walls. Service is quiet and somewhat ponderous. Try not to be anxious and appreciate that time moves differently here; he and his assistant in the tiny open kitchen won't hover or offer water incessantly. They will talk you through the menu and specials and then leave you alone until you're ready to order. We thought the Mombar, little sausages of rice and minced offal (liver?), delicately spiced in snappy chewy casings was the best and most interesting to eat. Neither that or the quite good mashed fava beans appetizer was photogenic, but both were quite good. The lamb tagine, on the other hand, was mediocre, neither well-seasoned or that tender with vegetables that were most likely from a frozen package. I only have a photo of the small pyramid of couscous to show you. Go and order something else and sit in for a slow ride back in time.\",\n",

It was so uncomfortable I got the check and left. I am so disappointed. I hope the chef can clean up his restaurant. Some of the stuff is just too old and it's borderline hoarding.

It was pretty good just on its own. Full disclosure - We asked the waiter if the dish was supposed to come with sauce and was told that people normally eat it without sauce in Taiwan.The chicken was juicy and flavorful and spiced nicely. One dish is definitely enough for two people to share. The texture is different. Its not like fried chicken or popcorn chicken, it was more like battered chicken with salt and pepper spices.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'A friend recommended this place and truthfully I could not be more pleased. I\\'ve never had Paraguayan food before but I have to admit, it is spectacular. One of my favorite dishes was cheesy rice. I think it only comes with a certain set of dishes, so if it doesn\\'t come with one of the dishes you want, ask if you can get it as an add on bc it is sooooo good. All rice should be cheesy rice. All of the dishes are quite hearty, so it\\'s a great amount of food. Even the salad feels \"hearty\" to me, very tasty and still refreshing. I always get the steak with onions and two sunny side up eggs. We\\'ve gotten quite a few empanadas by now, and I have to say my favorites are the ham and cheese and the empanada with a raisin and some other meats in it. Overall the food feels really authentic and full of quality and love. Would definitely recommend checking it out!I\\'m looking forward to trying their giant meat platter soon, and some desserts, because every time we eat there were too full for dessert.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'I\\'ve been saying \"I need to check this place out\" for the longest timeeee, and I finally went this past weekend and now I\\'m saying \"wow :( I wish I went sooner\"The service was incredible! We walked in at 10PM, even though they close at 11PM (I\\'m sorry! I was feeling indecisive that day) and they treated us amazingly nonetheless. The food was so delicious, I can\\'t wait to go back or randomly drop by for their corn appetizer. So good!',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Chipa Guazu - cheese and corn casserole. They call this a soufflé on the menu, that\\'s one way to class it up, I guess, but really it\\'s a casserole and you can probably make a better version at home. It\\'s edible though.Mbeyu - this was lacking, to say the least. It was super dry and desperately needed a condiment to add some flavor and/or moisture. I was hoping to ask our waiter for some ketchup or hot sauce to see if it would help, but unfortunately he was face timing using someone\\'s phone at the next table over, so I ended up leaving most of this. Empanadas - served in baskets with the type of empanada written on the wax paper it\\'s served on, except they didn\\'t serve me the correct empanada despite this handy reference \\xa0Instead of what I ordered I received a ham and cheese empanada (pictured). I asked our waiter if this was the right thing, the paper did after all say it was what I ordered, and he confirmed it was not and took it away. About ten minutes later, after we picked through most of our food, another waitress came to bus the table. I asked her if the empanada I actually ordered was almost ready, and she seemed confused. After this point our original waiter no longer talked to us and we had to communicate with this woman, who couldnt really understand what was going on, on top of not being aware of the original mistake. She conferred with our original waiter and it seemed like he forgot to actually put in the corrected order after whisking the wrong one away? I guess NOW they started heating up the right one? But we still sat there not knowing wtf was going on, until the waitress came back and said itd be yet another \"few minutes\". Basically this could have been an easy mistake to forgive but because of the incredible lack of common sense and basic customer service skills on both their parts, ended up being a really aggravating experience. Both the woman who was sent over to bus the table and our original waiter apologized but at that point it\\'s like, come on, you just made me sit here for an extra twenty minutes, I didn\\'t get what I ordered, and all on top of serving me pork, which I would never knowingly eat, ugh. Morale of the story, if you make a mistake with someone\\'s food, you should rectify it immediately, not wait for the customer to remind you, and don\\'t even think of charging the customer for the item YOU messed up. None of that happened here, and when they actually brought out the correct order right when we were about to ask for the check it was like... Really? I\\'m obviously not paying for this, and no I don\\'t want it after I finished my meal and am about to head out \\xa0There\\'s way too many other good spots in Sunnyside to give this place any business.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': \"I came here with a friend on a Saturday night for dinner. The service was slow. They were not responsive nor attentive. It took them a while for water refill and the time it took them to make the food was slow as well. By the time the food reached to us it was already cold. We ordered an appetizer and an entree. They should have served the appetizer first so that the food didn't arrive cold. Anyways, we ordered: Mixed appetizer that had two empanadas, couple of yucca, and something else that I forgot their names. Anyways, by the time the appetizer reached to us it was cold. Not sure if it was intended to be a cold dish or to be a hot dish. Anyways I couldn't tell the difference.Milanesa mixta that consisted on two milanesa of beef and one milanesa of chicken. The beef was dry and too hard to chew on.

       " {'restaurant': 'Sushi Daizen',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 1': \"TLDR: A quiet LIC sushi bar. Reasonably priced omakase that's great if you're venturing into omakase for the first time or if you've been into this style of dining for awhile. Sushi Daizen deserves it's place amongst all the Manhattan sushi bars. No theatrics, just a bar that serves excellent sushi and you'll keep coming back to.I had saw Sushi Daizen on Yelp some years ago and had placed it on my list. I eventually did make it over there and gave it a try. It reminds me a lot of a sushi bar in Tokyo. Very subtle signage, minimalist design, soft piano jazz.You can order a la carte here but the omakase is the way to go. For $75 you get a three-dish appetizer, a fish broth, 10 pieces of nigiri and a handroll. There is a sushi/sashimi omakase offered as well if you're trying to cut back on the rice I believe it's $90 but I can't remember for sure.The appetizers rotate but there is always the egg omelette included. This is then followed by the fish broth and then begins the sushi progression.I have been served by both Chef Etsuzo and the other chef - I don't know her name. They're both excellent though. Chef Etsuzo is great to talk with too, very laid back as he slices and prepares your nigiri.The nigiri here is a good size, not too small - not too large, just right. I love the taste of their rice here, the acidity is perfect and it just brings each piece together wonderfully. Sushi of course is - all about the rice.While the pieces vary a bit, the progression is usually the same more or less. Which I'm okay with, I know what I'm getting (give or take a few pieces) and I know that I'll enjoy it.The standout piece for me is always the barracuda when he has it. It's lightly torched that lends that smoky flavor and just leaves your face like O.O afterwards.You can always order more pieces if you'd like. I traditionally will get a handroll afterwards and then I'm good.I have been bringing friends here who want to try omakase or have been to quite a few on their own. I would say Sushi Daizen is probably my favorite between value, experience, taste, etc. I've frequented here more than any other sushi bar and I plan to for many years.Stop reading, call and book a spot at the bar. You'll be glad you did.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"For a place in LIC, this place can be comparable to those in Manhattan. For the amount of pieces for the Omakase, it was good. However, for each piece of sushi, there was way too much soy sauce brushed on and like another reviewer had mentioned, the grain of rice a bit too long. Another concern, the sushi chef took kept all pieces of fish in the fridge until it was time to serve, basically serving chilled fish. \\xa0Sushi shouldn't be served that cold.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"It's nice to have a relatively inexpensive (key word: relatively) in the neighborhood. We've been here a few times and have experienced both a regular table and the sushi bar. There really is just one menu - omakase for sushi. For $75 you can do 10 pieces or 6 piece sushi + sashimi for $90. We have gone for the 10 piece every time here. The fish is pretty good quality. Nothing has blown me away, but everything has been solid each time we've visited. At the end of course you can order ala carte including sushi that you might not have been served during omakase.Overall, if you're in the area and want a relatively inexpensive omakase for sushi, then it's a good option.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': \"Good but not good enough. We've tried almost every sushi omakasa in NYC. There're $500 pp places and $100 pp places and the in-betweens. This place falls in the lower end of the in between range. The problem is they are beat by the cheaper ones like sushi by bae in almost every aspect. Fish choices were not interesting enough. Some pieces were served too cold. Chef was boring. Rice was good. Cheap factory made wasabi. Gingers were too spicy but that's my personal preference. Given the competition I'm not coming back.\",\n",

Plenty of parking which is a plus as they don't have valet. \\xa0Made reservations for 4 at 6pm Saturday. Our friend had been there previously and enjoyed the food and service. He spoke highly about the great service he received from the owner/staff and asked about her. He was told she's currently on vacation. Bread served immediately but our friend who had been there previously felt rushed from the minute we sat down. We were busy catching up and having some cocktails. The server came around a few times for our appetizer order. We ordered two orders of the baked clams and shared there special homemade cream sauce pasta. I really enjoyed both of these dishes and was looking forward to my entree. They have a bunch of specials. They all sounded amazing! We all ordered from their specials. I ordered the soft shell crab which at the price I would've expected them to be decently sized. I had one decently sized and the other super small! Taste wise it was just okay! Not worth the price tag. I don't mind paying at all for food as long as it's worth it! The side for it was okay some sort of cheese zucchini wrap. I wish they had other options to accompany the dish. Our friends said their meals were just okay nothing to rave about. Our friend who came here previously was disappointed as he said it was different when he came. Dessert - Napoleon, cappuccinos and sambuca. Talk about delicious! So fresh,delicious and not too sweet! We all loved the napoleon! Get this dessert truly amazing! Caps were great too! After this some of us had another round of cappuccinos. Unfortunately, although yes they were busy there were plenty of open tables but we felt rushed. So we quickly paid the bill which was not cheap but fairly priced and ended up talking in the street. We left feeling slightly disappointed in food some hits some misses and but overall the disappointment was the service.

I personally stumbled into this place thinking I could buy a duck udon to go for my mother since the weather was getting cold. Upon finally finding the relatively unmarked door (security grate over the window is left down), I was immediately told by the maitre d/server/owner?, nah we don't do take out or to go. So mission failed. Then I remembered the website said reservations only. So I walked back in the door again and thought ah why not see why this udon nazi place doesn't do take out or to go. Made a res for the next evening. And man was I glad I did. This place is versatile. It's not just udon. I had the beef tataki app. Perfectly cooked thin slices of steak with a vinegrette salad on top. Had the tuna tartare app. Balanced and light and delicious. Also went with a chicken karaage. So juicy and crisp. But wait... Before I take a selfie... Where's the sauce? I only see a small wedge of lemon. That's right. No spicy mayo type orange sauce usu standard with this bird. That's how good it is. Doesn't need sauce. Seasoned just right either with salt and or from the marinade/brine. For mains we went with duck and pork udons. Simple, but very good. Udon noodles had a nice bouncy mouthfeel. Soup was light but flavorful. Protein was thinly sliced and cooked to perfection (pink for the duck, fully cooked for the pork). For desert we had the home made shiso flan. Good flan but not sure I really tasted much shiso. But it's flan so can't be too aggressive with it I suppose. All in all ordered so much, ate so much and didnt spend very much. Compared to Manhattan that is. Based on experience,food of this quality would easily be 40% mor expensive and not be 40% better tasting in the city. If I were to compare the udon, I'd first think of raku, whose \\xa0udon was more rich. Noodles were def hand kneaded and pulled. Noodles here... Hard to tell. But they were still great and didn't get soggy. The broth at raku is also much heavier and saltier. Hard to say which is better. To each their own one may suppose.Bottom line, I will be back here. Too many things still to try on the menu. Cooked and raw, the menu has it all and I am confident to say will likely not disappoint. I will make that blind bet all day. Outside on the window, all the Michelin recommended stickers might say something my non stop rambling hasn't. But as for all things worth experiencing, do try for urself. So there is a notable community of Japanese who live in forest hills, here for work I assune. But not many Japanese restaurants I would care to go to. Who knows.

Not a big deal.I ordered the Mixed Grill ($25). It included beef/lamb gyro meat, chicken shish kebab, lamb shish kebab, and adana kabab served with rice and mixed green salad. They also gave us warm complementary Turkish bread with tzatziki sauce.It didn't take too long to prepare our orders and before I knew it, I was digging in! All the meats were absolutely delicious. Super tender, well-seasoned, and full of flavor! The rice and salad were pretty basic but went well with the meats which were the main stars of the dish.The meal was definitely shareable among 2 people. I only ate half of it and brought the rest home. For being $25 and 2 meals, it is worth it! Shout out to the waiter for the friendly, quick, and efficient service.If you're looking for some solid Turkish food in Astoria, definitely check out Truva!\",\n",

We told her we did not and the next words out of her mouth was \"we can\\'t help you then\". We looked around and saw literally 20+ open seats. She spoke to us as if we were beneath her and that this place is doing us a favor if they accepted us. Just so we\\'re on the same page... WE PAY YOUR SALERY! You continue treating people the way you did with us, you\\'ll find yourself in the unemployment line. \\xa0 We asked her to ask the manager if he can make an exception or even outdoor seating. Keep in mind we were not argumentative what so ever as were mainly seeking options for our long drive here. She went to the back and came back 30 seconds later stating the manager said that there was nothing they can do. We did not push for an argument and ended up leaving extremely insulted. I can\\'t say with certainty however, my daughter was wearing the hand of god around her neck and I noticed the lady continue to stare at it. If your not familiar with this specific necklace, it represents Judaism. Mind you were in a Turkish restaurant.

They'll tell you that yet don't know or they don't have time to take care of you, because they're always so busy.

The cook itself was rushed, so that the fat wasn't rendered well -- they pulled and make the meat difficult to bite off (compare with well made lechon or beef rib, but the fat is crispy and melty. The finish was also rushed: the finishing dry rub was good, as I mentioned, but the sesames on the crust were burnt as a result of a careless char. This item was a 2/5, with an easy improvement to 3.5 by either not burning or just removing the burnt seed layer, and a further improvement to 4.5 by slow cooking to wholly render the fat and connective tissue.\",\n",

Just to be clear, the muslin lamb is nothing spectacular, and the spices barely made much of an impact to the existing meat, which was a bit...odd tasting to me. My favorite was actually the fried fish, but even then, it was too breaded for my taste.

It's probably cause the kitchen was tiny. A whole lobster, shrimp, calamari, scallops, and a filet of fish. It tasted like the baked clams.

To start we hit the queso fundido with chorizo, \\xa0shrimp emerador, and the guacamole. \\xa0 The queso fundido was spectacular I could not hey enough. \\xa0 It comes with bread and these large very thin tortillas for dipping. \\xa0 It's a must. \\xa0 The shrimp emperor was like a warm ceviche, limey and spicy. \\xa0Another home ruin. Three guacamole was probably the best I've ever had, and they give you enough chips you don't have top ask for more. \\xa0 Nuff said. For our main we got the 10 taco tray. \\xa0You cam pick up to 3 different meats. \\xa0 For 5 if it's it was more than enough. \\xa0 We're got chorizo, steak and al pastor. \\xa0 Again very good tasty. \\xa0 It's in three tower with all the fixings on the top. \\xa0 Very nice unique presentation.To top it all off the service was very very good. \\xa0 Water was always filled and our waitresses Elena was not ever very far away and checked on us often. \\xa0 We got a visit from the manager Alex at least twice. \\xa0 He even took our dessert order after I raved to him how much I liked it here. \\xa0 I'll be back again every time I'm in the mood for quality mex food. \\xa0So instead of walking Northern Blvd I'll go one block north top 31st Avenue. \\xa0King of Tacos is my new go to place for Mexican hood.

We often times drive by this restaurant and see how many people are here that we had to give it a try ourselves! First I have to shout out Elena! She was an amazing waitress who gave us the best recommendation on food and had the sweetest personality. Must haves: Chorizo queso fundido- one of the best queso fundido I've have in the neighborhood by far. The tacos were also amazing! Just wish we had room for more. We ordered the platter of ten tacos for 4 people and that was just enough with all of our appetizers. There was a live singer walking around singing request- he is also the lead singer of the mariachi band that do shows on Friday's and sundays. Another huge huge shout out to the manager Alex who was the nicest! When we ordered dessert he presented us with a platter of samples. Of course we ate it all!

The staff and chefs really know what they are doing, especially Alex ! Really great hospitality and really great food. For apps we got the corn and guac. To die for. I know good guac when I taste it.. this one was one of the best! A little spicy and super fresh. The Mexican corn was also to die for.. a little acidic and just perfect. For entrees we ordered pulpo (octopus) tacos, carnitas tacos and the al pastor tacos. I LOVE tacos and these are some of the best I've had. I will say, I think the pastor tacos WERE the best I've had. They were literally perfection.... I'd order six of them if I could and eat them all in one shot.

       "  'Negative Review 1': \"Horrible service. Everything was fine at the beginning when we came in and we were seated very quick. We were a party of nine people (4 kids and 5 adults, two of us under 21). We were given menus, drink menus and water, everything good. They gave my aunt and mom wine samples and we ordered food and drinks, two different checks. I asked my mom to order me a piña colada, and she asked our waitress (I believe her name is Claudia) for one and she didn't ask if with alcohol or not, which was a bit weird because whenever we go out somewhere to a place with drinks and around children, the waiters usually ask. Anyways, we got it and it was FULL of alcohol, I couldn't drink it because I'm 18, so we asked Claudia to bring a virgin piña colada. That's when she got all defensive and trying to blame it on my mom. My mom just asked her to take this one back and make one without alcohol, the waitress passive aggressively said okay and left. She came back, and we gave the alcoholic one back to the waitress. The wait for food is horrendous. We waited over an hour for our food, by then everyone was pretty much frustrated and ready to leave. I'm only giving it two stars because the food was good and the mariachi was great, if it weren't for those two, this place would get a big fat ONE STAR. We got the checks at the end and noticed how Claudia charged us for TWO piña coladas, the alcoholic one we sent back. We notified her, and she said that wasn't her problem, basically telling us we are being charged for not drinking something? We gave her the alcoholic one back, so why are we being charged??? She was just being rude to my mom, that's when we told the manager or supervisor and he took it off the bill. Also, my aunt gave her debit card to Claudia, and she wouldn't give it back to my aunt without my mom paying first, but she was gonna pay cash??? My aunt then said fine, that she would report her debit card stolen, that's when Claudia ran to get her debit card back. I just don't understand how such lovely place has such HORRIBLE staff.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': \"THE WORST EXPERIENCE EVER.I was really looking forward to trying the food due to the great reviews, but the awful service I experienced completely ruined any hopes I had of this restaurant.My experience on 6/29:I ordered two orders of tacos and a side of corn for delivery around 8:10pm from their online Wix website. A few minutes after I ordered, I called to make sure that the order had gone through and they confirmed that it had. I normally order delivery off of Seamless, but for some reason it had them listed as closed (even though they close at midnight).Around 9:30pm, I called wondering where my order was because it had been nearly an hour and a half of waiting. They told me that the order was already on its way, so I thought it would be another 10-15 minute wait since I don't live that far from them.After another half hour of waiting, I attempted to call multiple times to ask what was going on with my order, but no matter how many times I dialed, the calls would not go through. I started getting concerned and frustrated (and hangry)...so much so that I even tried to call a Lyft to drive me to the restaurant. I was getting no response, and I was starting to feel helpless.But right before my Lyft driver arrived, the delivery guy called. It was 10:15pm. More than TWO hours after placing the order!! I really wanted to like this place, but based on this experience, I doubt I'll ever order again.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': \"I've ordered from this place a few times, and the food has been good, however my most recent order was the last.I placed a rather sizable order for delivery and from previous experience, a wait time was to be expected. I also understand that weekends are normally busy, but it should not take over an hour and a half to deliver to a location less than 10 blocks away, on the same avenue mind you. Turns out the deliver person was given the wrong address. I suppose it can't be helped since the place always has very loud music blasting in the background when I call.Worst part of all of this was once I finally received my order, there was an order missing. So, I called to let them know I had a missing order and the person on the phone told me that everything I ordered was in the bags. I explained that there isn't anything else left in the bag in front of me, and she insisted that all the food was placed in the bags.So, this woman on the phone is essentially doing a few things to me:she's calling me a liar, and she's stealing from me. Eventually, after thoroughly explaining a few more times that my order is missing, she said that they're bringing me another order. Unfortunately, the order was never delivered. In addition to calling me a liar and stealing from me, in the end I was lied to as well.I've never had a problem ordering from this place. I've ordered from this place several times, since they're so close to where I live, and they have good food, but why on earth would I go out of my way to lie about something like this, after ordering from them in the past and waiting an hour and a half for my food. I was really hoping for a positive turnout, but the situation was handled extremely poorly. Apparently, an appetizer is worth more to this place than losing a customer forever. Safe to say, I will never be ordering from them again.Fair warning to people who order from this place; you'd better hope they take your address down correctly, and that your order isn't missing anything, because you won't be getting your delivery in a timely manner or a replacement for your missing food.\"},\n",

For food, turns out, we just wanted to share several apps. Started with an order of wings tossed in cashew scallion teriyaki sauce. Big, fresh, tasty wings, sauce was outstanding. Went through half a stack of napkins. Totally worth it. Next, spinach artichoke dip. Consistency was perfect for scooping. We asked for more pita chips and the second batch came out hot and crispy. I alternated nibbles of scotch egg. A little more hard-boiled than I expected, still enjoyable, with a somewhat McNuggety finish. Prices were reasonable, fair even, considering the location.

I did feel like it was underseasoned--I know that they gave me shakers of dried garlic, dried oregano, parmesan, and hot pepper flakes, but it seems like an oversight to not have some seasoning involved in the baking of the pizza in the kitchen. As much as I enjoyed the pizza at the time (after seasoning it), it was pretty underwhelming when I got it home.

If you drive too fast, you\\'ll miss it. Yelp help me find it. *Yelp tip: always use the sorting filter \"MOST REVIEWED\" & pick from that list.* It\\'s been a breakthrough in my / relationship w/YELP. The first bite was perfect, toasty, crisp on entry and soft on the inside. The pizza tasted so close to Napolitano style pizza, I had to find out the ingredients. Luckily, the Pizzaiolo was around so I approached him with questions; he revealed he uses a little oil, along with other pizza dough staples: flour, salt, yeast & water. However, NO sugar! Dough goes through a cold fermentation, followed by room temperature. I also asked if he uses a yeast starter since I\\'ve learned that many of my favorite pizza places use one. He said sometimes but mostly for making generic bread. Lastly, he asked me if I run a place and I said no:/ and explained I\\'m just a girl from Queens who lives in Tacoma, WA & out of the frustration of NOT finding good pizza, started making her own. The pizzaiolo lastly shared some pearls: use a stone and crank the oven temp to as high as it goes. Tips that have taken me about a year to learn. Forno Pizzeria e Trattoria understands the art of pizza making! Now, how do we get them a license to sell alcohol, because I sure would\\'ve liked a glass of sauvignon blanc with this pizza. Here\\'s \\xa0the gist: Would I travel from Manhattan to Queens for this pizza? Nope, because you\\'ll probably find just as good of pizza in the city, but if your in Queens and are in the mood for the personal pizza in a quaint little private spot as opposed to \"pizza by the slice\" experience, then YES go to Forno\\'s.

Food: Very Good (4 of 5). Dishes We've Had:- Pork Buns: Instead of pork belly, Shuya uses a thick, leaner but generous cut of meat. The result is pretty good, if a little dry.- Shuya Ramen: This dish uses a combination chicken / fish / clam broth. It's not as tasty as a creamy tonkotsu broth, but it is supposedly much healthier. Everything else in the dish came together to create a very good experience -- the wavy noodles had a perfect chew; the two slices of pork char siu were generously thick as in the pork buns. The two clams and ramen egg were pretty good, too.Service: Good (3 of 5). Complimentary water, invisibly refilled.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5).

You could easily tell that the tables had regulars but then again this was my first time and I was treated like family so I could be wrong. I ordered the chicken parm with spaghetti.

She then proceeded to wait on almost a dozen customers before we received our order, even though they came and went long after we ordered. Our kids ordered iced lattes, my wife an Americano and mine was a cappuccino. All are easy and fast drinks to prepare. As I type this, we are still waiting on our bagels as she continues to serve customers who keep walking in the door.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': 'Absolutely terrible 1st time customer experience. This review is based on customer service. This place has issues hiding within these walls. Just moved into the neighborhood recently and wanted to find a coffee shop I could relax at and get work done. I walked into this establishment and was happily greeted by two ladies. I asked if they had juice and wifi? The gentleman responded yes and YES WIFI. Before I go any further it\\'s important to 1) have wifi in a cafe and 2) if you have a wifi sign posted, that would give me the impression wifi is available and finally 3) trust the employee when they say wifi is available .....you would think right?I took a seat and asked multiple times for the password. The guy said told me what he thought was the password. It wasn\\'t. He made a call to find out the issue (Calling his boss) but got distracted with only one customer that came in with two other employee standing around. The password doesn\\'t work. He told me to try another wifi login from another store (AT&T Time Warner Provider) that didn\\'t work either because I\\'m not a Time Warner Customer.Disappointed, I decided to pack all my stuff and began to walk towards the exit once the guy finished up with his customer. Very nicely I said, \"Listen man your place seems like a nice small place to come to and your employee\\'s were nice greeting me at the door but I\\'m a little disappointed that your wifi doesn\\'t work when you told me it did. I bought the JUICE ONLY after you told me you had wifi.\" He made one last effort and called his boss to figure out what was going on with the server/login. They talk back and forth agreeing that THE GUY told me the wifi was down trying to cover up that fact that he told me the wifi was down! The guys tells me it\\'s been down for a couple days since other technicians were arranging things in the establishment. I started to get even more upset (but not screaming or yelling) \"Dude really. You lied to me. Before I bought the juice you told me you had wifi, so I bought the drink. I was planning on working here for some time and without wifi I\\'ve been wasting my time here and my money. This has been terrible experience. He apologizes and tries to give me a protein bar. I\\'m about to walk out the door when he asks whether or not I paid for my juice! Then I said surprisingly, \"Your kidding right. After all that your going to STILL attempt to charger me for this juice! You just lied to me. Did you not??\" (He unhappily agrees) \"Then why would you think it\\'s fair to charger me for something when you told me before I bought the juice you had wifi? I never would have purchased the juice if I knew you didn\\'t have wifi.\" No real response only \"I have kids, my job is the bring money to my boss\" he says. I tell him \"that doesn\\'t apply in this situation. You need to take responsibly for making a mistake and own up!\" I\\'m about to walk out fed up with everything, then threatens that he\\'ll call the police if I don\\'t pay. It took an incredible amount of patience, pride and inner whoop ass not to just walk out. I wasn\\'t taking this matter any longer so I paid and told the guy I would never be coming back, he\\'s yelp would be getting a terrible review. *****Ask if they\\'re wifi works before expecting to bust out your laptop for a couple hours. Make sure the login username- password works first before you sit down or order a drink/food. They just might lie to you to bring in customers.',\n",

The place is also very clean and service is friendly and attentive.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I've made it a casual weekend mission to visit all the Filipino restaurants in the Woodside/Sunnyside area and, not to spoil this entire review, Kabayan on Queens Blvd is the best one yet.I've given this place, and many others, a fair shot--visiting at least three or four times over the past year or two, to really take every aspect of the restaurant into account. My first venture into Kabayan was a Boodle fight meal with my boyfriend and one of our other friends. We were surprised that the spread was ready right as we walked in; just a testament to the good service here. I had initially only visited its neighbor Tito Rad's because for some reason, it always looked way more pack. I don't think that's the case anymore nowadays, though.We were greeted and seated immediately. Kabayan sticks out to me particularly because, unlike virtually all the Filipino restaurants in the area, the service here is actually great. The water is poured as you're seated (I'm looking at you, Renee's in Woodside), the servers are super attentive, and it doesn't take a million years to get the check. Filipinos by default are very hospitable and very polite but the water pouring and occasional hovering throughout is an American thing and we'd all love for it to apply here, too. It's good for business.Now for the food! I'd be biased as to say that every single Filipino restaurant in this area is fantastic but I really do mean it. Cooking these dishes has almost been embedded into each family that, although we do have regional variations, you can never really go wrong. Here at Kabayan, though.. wow. Everything is just so perfectly seasoned. The beef Nilaga is fantastic, among many others. I would've loved if they served breakfast (silog's) all day but there is an easy workaround where you can just order Sinangag, the meats, and eggs separately. It'll just run you a few extra bucks. Their sizzling sisig and Bangus (milkfish) is soooo good. I've brought so many friends of different cultures here and these seem to be a favorite. One of my personal favorites is the Pancit Canton.. shrimp allergy and all, hah.If you're ever in the area or if you're on a quest for really good Filipino food, this place is well worth a visit!\",\n",

I've had Filipino food in the city before, as well as homemade, and Kabayan comes closest to homemade! We ordered the lumpia, kare kare, bistek, lechon, pancit, garlic rice and ssisig.

I am not a fan of seitan, and fake meats can be really hit or miss so we stayed away from those kinds of options. Instead we choose the spicy mushrooms and pad Thai for the main course. I love that the mushrooms come with kale and rice to offset the sweet sauce. The pad Thai was absolutely perfect.

But all my other experiences have just been upsetting. I ordered the eggplant and green bean lunch special last year and while it was good, I had an awful bout of food poisoning (the works) right afterwards. I've ordered twice again from Jujube Tree after the food poisoning (I wanted to give them another chance) and though I was never sick again, the food is just SO MEH and is lacking in flavor. I ordered the BiBimBap only to be met with an assortment of flavorless veggies that did not compliment each other well. Another try was the BBQ Satay lunch special which was also completely lacking in flavor (How can have a BBQ dish that has NO BBQ flavor?) I had to douse both of these dishes in Sriracha to make them bearable so I wasn't just throwing money away.However, I will say that I do like their pumpkin soup and spring rolls and that is what is keeping this review at 2 stars vs 1 star. TLDR; their food is really hit or miss. Nothing is consistent.

Besides the fact that this location is highly overpriced for the area is an understatement, however, what was more concerning was the managements blatant disregard for their customers safety. First, they allowed a guest at the bar to vape while waiting for their drink. To be clear, electronic cigarettes (vaping) is banned anywhere cigarettes are prohibited yet they let this guest do it and made no attempt to stop the behavior. Second, they allowed an unleashed dog inside the dining room, where the dog was free to roam around and was running up and down the restaurant. When my peripheral vision caught side out the dog, I could have bet my arms and legs it was a huge rat - nope, it was a dog. Don't get me wrong, I love animals but wtf is this dog doing inside a restaurant, running around as if it's his backyard!? Again, no mention to the patron who not surprisingly also happens to be the same person who was vaping at the bar not long before.

Mega Paitan is what I usually get, and it's just enough to fill me up. The broth is rich, ultra-collagenous(just short of Mu Ramen's Oxtail and Bone Marrow Ramen), and just a tad milky. The noodles are firm, but they can change that at your request.Surprisingly, the chicken char-siu is the more consistent meat topping, while the pork can be hit or miss in terms of cook, as well as flavour. The pork isn't as good here as Manhattan locations. I've never had a problem with the spring onions as much I did with the garlic paste. I found that the garlic paste is incredibly salty and overpowering, which detracts from the broth and makes it unfinishable. This is a problem for me no matter which Totto I go to. If you're like me, you might ask for a separate bowl to put the paste and add it in as desired. I enjoy the garlic flavour, but the sodium content is obnoxious. The last time I went (7/7/19) was an outlier in that the broth was almost clear, unlike the creamy and rich broth that I was used to. It may have been because I was there for lunch, so you may need to account for that factor when eating ramen there.\",\n",

It\\'s definitely not a bad bowl of ramen but it\\'s not nearly enough to justify its price of $18 even with the \"extra\" toppings. Everything was average. Despite the relatively large bowl, there was an overload of cabbage and what felt like only three bites of noodles. Half of my time eating the bowl was picking up pieces of cabbage. Normally this amount of time spent eating cabbage would over saturate the noodles with broth, but luckily there weren\\'t that many noodles to speak of. This isn\\'t a bad thing. I know plenty of people who love cabbage and prefer to avoid carbs. It also wasn\\'t spicy but the server brought extra sauce to increase the heat. Service was great, and the server was friendly. The chicken char siu was abysmal, and I\\'m not convinced it\\'s actually chicken. Hard avoid paying $2 for it. It was soft like a wet turkey slice but difficult to chew and break down, like tendon, except it\\'s somehow called chicken. It\\'s not a bad place, but relative to the other strong options nearby, I wouldn\\'t come here.

The only good thing was their fresh orange juice! In summary, this place is so NOT worth your money.',\n",

This place is popular and it is assembly line style so you can see exactly what you to eat. The chicken drumsticks stole the show. They also have these meat alternatives that are almost indistinguishable. Especially the ginger noodles with 'meat'. And the Mac n cheese tasted boxed but still yummy and appreciative. Seating isn't ideal. This is mostly a grab n go type of place or a grab, sit, eat wicked fast, then leave type of place. Prices are reasonable for the large portions which are more than filling. Definitely one of the better places I've visited in NYC. Cheers.\",\n",

The \"sister\" restaurant to Sybil\\'s Bakery next door. While Sybil\\'s gives you an amazing selection of Guyanese food and baked goods, Veggie Castle is the sister who came back from college (somewhat) health conscience, cruelty free, and (mostly) Vegan. She isn\\'t attending some liberal arts school though, definitely at culinary school, because she\\'s got all the flavors! \"Cafeteria\" style service, a bain marie at the front counter holds all of your hopes and dreams. You can choose a small or large container, it\\'s perfect as take out or to eat on the spot in their small seating area. As for the food itself I\\'m not even sure what anything really is, but it\\'s literally all amazing. You would never know you aren\\'t eating meat. The flavors are full but what sets apart these \"alternatives\" are their amazing textures. The drumsticks taste and chew just like chicken. It\\'s almost bizarre. \\xa0They also serve vegan/vegetarian baked goods (the cakes look great) as well as a fully customizable smoothie bar which lists the health benefits of each ingredient or predesigned recipe. Free yourself from the routine of meat, heal yourself while escaping bland vegan options. Love yourself and stop by Veggie Castle II. **Get lucky!

The storefront is small, the place gets busy at night (I was there 8:45 on a Thurs) but the line moves and the amount of people inside should not let you stray from waiting. My boyfriend and I split a large plate for under $15. It was 3 sides and 2 proteins, so you get a good variety. Portion sizes are very strong, and for two people it was some filling, wholesome eats. Their seating section is detached from the line, I didn't realize they had seating until after paying. I didn't know what to expect because I have just heard about Veggie Castle from WOM but I'm pretty impressed by everything there.

Delicious and this location is amazing. Very authentic to what I would get when away. Large selection or meats, veggies, noodles and more. My friend and I get the beef lamb combo for meat. It's large and perfect for us. We load up on veggies cause they're fresh and delicious. Love their noodles. Always get two orders. Helps that my daughter loves noodles. I love their shrimp balls too. We get the half and half pot. The spicy is so spicy but so good at the same time. Definitely try half and half don't be wimpy and only get mild. But I do love the mild soup. I drink so much! I also love their pork dumplings. Not hot pot, just boiled. They're delicious and I could eat a million of them. So good. The staff is always so nice. They're friendly and helpful. They'll answer questions and are very good at refilling drinks/ water. It's a nice clean restaurant. Modern look to it. And I just saw they have all you can eat Tuesday through Friday. It's limited options but yay! And I think it was advertised at like 17 bucks. Very reason. I'm excited to go.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"This became me and my wife's favorite hot pot place. And here're reasons why:1. Staffs are great. When you're thinking about going to Chinese restaurant, probably one of few reasons makes you hesitate to visit would be their speaking. Don't get me wrong, I don't mean any disrespect; it's their accent from speak Chinese, which might sounds pretty aggressive even if they're trying to speak English as best as they can. This place, however, will giving you an impression that you are being treated at high end western restaurant. Indeed, not every staff members are fluent at English, but they are still gentle. Whenever we visit here, if they found out we can't speak Chinese, lady Becky always came to us and help us out. Believe me, their service quality deserve more than 5 star. 2. SoupHot pot. Hot. Spicy. That's like a stereotype we have. Try their half&half. We visited here several times and every time I went and grabbed some sauce, but I ended up less than a half. The soup by itself is the dish. It's warm, filling, healthy and tasty. They also offer to make it to go if you couldn't finish it. 3. FoodsIt doesn't need to be fresh for hot pot. But it's fresh. Veggies, meats, fries, whatever. Their lamb skewer is also out favorite. Well seasoned, cooked on-point. 4. PriceI believe I don't need to mention any about the price. It's such an amazing deal. I'm not a heavy yelper, so most likely I leave a review when I'm either really disappointed or really impressed. This is latter. Every single time we visiting here, the quality overall is so high and yet so constant.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Was in Flushing and craving hotpot so we decided to try Little Sheep, which is a well-known name place with several locations. First off, it's in a very crowded area and parking is a nightmare. If you park in the garage across the street it's $4 for 2 hours, which isn't too bad. Readily identifiable from the street, the interior has a sleek and modern design with open booths. They have lunch specials during the week, but as we were there on a Saturday we had the regular menu. It's a bit like some sushi places I've been to- everything is ordered ala carte and there's a paper menu they provide which has all the options and their individual price (seafood, meats, noodles, veggies etc). You mark which ones you want and the quantity, and the server verifies the order before it goes to the kitchen. The concept is designed so the entire table can share whatever is selected. There are two burners on each table so you can have two pots going at once. Pros:Food was tasty and fresh, good quality. Broth was very flavorful.Restaurant was very clean and had a nice ambience. Service was impeccable. The entire staff was friendly and made us feel welcome, they immediately bussed empty dishes and refilled both broth and drinks. Cons:Ala carte adds up pretty quickly- for four people (two children) and just enough food ordered, with no dessert and only water to drink, it was over $90 tip included. Sauce bar, while clean, did not have as many options as I've seen at other locations. Menu was somewhat limited. I prefer the buffet style hotpot where everyone can go up and choose what they want for an inclusive price. I would give it 4 stars just for the service but since you can't give half stars, I'm rounding down to 3. Good ambience, great service, tasty food, but somewhat limited selection. I enjoyed it and would return, but with other options out there I think I'll try them first.\",\n",

Their buffet only included fatty beef, lamb, some glass noodles, thick noodles you have to pay $1 for, and some other items. All vegetables must be paid extra, and other kinds of items.

       "  'Positive Review 2': 'Sifu Chio (道記港式雲吞麵; something like Chio\\'s Hong Kong Style Noodles), also known as Prince Noodle & Café -- the English name on the restaurant\\'s signage -- is a Hong Kong style wonton noodle shop with an old-school, budget-friendly feel in Downtown Flushing. Food: OK (3 of 5). We had the following:- Dumpling Trio Lo Mein (三色餃撈麵): $9.- Duet Noodle Soup (雙星湯麵): $8.- \"Blanched Chinese Vegetable\" (Blanched Choy Sum; 油菜): $5.50. Worth getting only if you have an extra craving for choy sum, which are sufficiently represented in the noodle soups. Sifu Chio\\'s wonton noodles are tossed in mix of oyster sauce and sesame oil, and are pretty good. Of the two dedicated wonton noodle shops now in Downtown Flushing -- Maxi\\'s Noodles, which recently moved to a new location three short blocks away, is the other -- Sifu Chio presently has the better noodles (*), while Maxi\\'s has the better wontons and dumplings. Maxi\\'s wontons have a fresh \"crunch\" not present in wontons from Sifu Chio, though Sifu Chio\\'s wontons and dumplings are still pretty good.Service and Atmosphere: OK (3 of 5). Sifu Chio is a small corner space, with six tables with four seats each. Everything is served using disposable dining ware -- disposable plates and bowls, chopsticks and spoons -- not environmentally friendly but par for course. Those with mobility concerns should keep in mind that the bathroom is down a flight of stairs. (*) This may be a short-term advantage, as Maxi\\'s is in a shakedown phase getting used to its new location and customer volume. Sifu Chio has pretty good wonton noodles, but Maxi\\'s Noodles has had wonton noodles made with duck eggs, which somehow made their noodles awesome.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'At one point in time, I think Sifu Chio was a 5 star caliber wonton spot. Despite a change in ownership in the last few years, I still haven\\'t found a dedicated place for straight Cantonese style wontons that is as good as this place. While the wontons were better circa 2013, this place is still a sure thing when it comes to wonton noodle staple.Back in the day, a bowl ran as low as $3.95 (#1) but inflation has caught up as now most bowls are in the $7-8 range. Instead of actual bowls, this place tends to go with the styrofoam or plastic bowls, which I suppose works well for situations where one doesn\\'t finish the food. The wontons are very solid. Skin can get a bit thick at times, but I appreciate the ratio of shrimp to meat for the combo ones. My favorite ones to order at the trio wontons with noodles in soup (三色餃湯麵), which I think is the best value amongst all the combinations. The soup base was tastier at one point, but I think the noodles and wontons are still within range of tastiness.And while wontons get all the press, they also make a killer set of fish balls, fish cakes, and dumplings. The latter is not my favorite and really never has been, mainly due to the doughiness of the skin and the fact it\\'s not really crispy for the pan fried ones. The fried wonton (炸餛吞) is fun to eat, but without noodles or soup; they work ideally on their own like an appetizer.And the extra star goes to the fact they serve congee. Not just any congee, but flavored congee with options like carp or minced beef and the ever classic \"lean pork\" with black egg (皮蛋瘦肉粥). They also rock the beef brisket as well, but only for a $3 extra. I also think their lo mein is actually somewhat underrated as their dry noodle combinations are an excellent option for lunch.Lastly, it\\'s a cash only business (#2) and the staff is pretty friendly. They are one of the very few Cantonese speaking businesses and seem to take delight when patrons are the same way. There is never a bad time to come here. Lunch might seem like the logical choice, but I\\'ve had plenty of solo meals during dinner time. It\\'s never all that busy and they have just enough tables to keep a small crowd in here at all times. ____________(#1) Pretty insane how expensive Flushing has become. Even Peking Duck Buns were .50 cents a pop.(#2) Welcome to Flushing.',\n",

My meal started with a Chicken Samosa. While the samosa itself was just okay, the cilantro chutney it came with was fantastic. I would love to douse everything I eat in it. Shortly after came my Chicken Tikka Masala and Garlic Naan. The Garlic Naan was a huge disappointment. Lacking in flavor and too chewy, make sure you have rice for your gravy dishes, because it will not work as a substitute. The Chicken Tikka Masala was good, but not good enough to eat until I was stuffed. The consistency of the chicken was remarkable and probably the best part of the dish. The problem was the sauce was overly sweet. It needed more depth of flavor and more heat. Maybe we didn't give it enough to stew by arriving for an early lunch.Quantity: Each of the dishes I ordered was large enough to share. The mains are huge and easily two meals.Value: $3 for Chicken Samosas. $4 for Garlic Naan. $14 for Chicken Tikka Masala.Ambiance: Aroma Indian Cuisine is located in Rego Park, Queens. The unassuming shop sits on Woodhaven Blvd. The decor is non-existent and if not for the music, I would have no idea what kind of restaurant I was visiting.

Dishes came out pretty quickly upon ordering. OMG, I haven't had a \\xa0good peking style pork chop for quite some time and this place delivered it. (I always request peking style pork chop every time I go to a cantonese restaurant.) The sauce had the perfect acidity; it was not overly sour or too sweet. The meat was juicy, thin, and crispy. It wasn' thick, fatty, or overpowdered. It was....done right. I'm so in love. Next time I'm here, I would love to try their salt and pepper pork chop. Almost every table in the restaurant ordered their cage free chicken. It was juicy and tender. The dish came with the ginger and scallion sauce and they gave you a generous amount. My dad and I really appreciate it because we love to pair it up with a bowl of rice. Your taste buds will thank you. The waiters were friendly and attentive.

My favorite dish out of everything we tried had to be the lobster glutinous rice and i've never tried anything like this! The lobster was succulent and the rice had great texture and a rich seafood flavor. Eating the lobster was also pretty mess-free because of they way they chopped it into pieces.

I had the beef noodle soup ($6.95) and they ran out of the thick white noodles and had to substitute with the thin yellow egg noodles. Also, the beef chunks in the noodle soup were not very beefy, they were mostly beef tendons which I am not a fan of, so the stock photo in the menu is deceiving!

We took an open table and ordered coffees while looking over the menu. While ordering our meals, we were told Brunch menu items can't be modified, and that we'd only be able to add things, so I'm assuming things were not made to order(?). Sucks, as I was having brunch with a vegetarian and someone with multiple food allergies. They did have a few vegetarian options, but we wouldn't be able to customize items without meat, so choices were very limited. (tragic.) My friend with allergies originally wanted to order an item, asking it be made without avocados- but they couldn't do that for him so he ordered the biscuits. My boyfriend (vegetarian) ordered a breakfast burrito, they offered the chorizo add for meat eaters. I ordered the mushroom hash and added two poached eggs. For being pre-made or whatever the case, the food took a bit of time to come out. The server accidentally brought my boyfriend the burrito with chorizo, which he wouldn't have realized it had meat had I not tasted it first. Would've been unfortunate. :( My food -the mushroom hash- looked boring and plain with the arugula and greens on top, HOWEVER, the flavors of the beets and runny eggs and hashbrowns (with a ton of hot sauce) is something I still dream about today!! And with all the greens on my plate, it made it seem guilt free. hehe. My meal was very filling.

Grilled octopus looked so good In photos on Yelp but at $22 we decided not to try it. Small Greek salad was enough for 2 but feta cheese tasted like a band aid. No lamb gyros. Only pork and chicken. IMHO putting meat into pita does not make a gyro. The meat BTW was dry both in the pork gyro and the chicken and pork combo platter that my husband had. Charged .75 cents for extra tzatziki.

The staff is always welcoming and friendly as well, although sometimes they can be a little....\"pushy\" when it comes to ordering. But I respect the hustle.-Vegetable Dumplings: 3.5/5, these are pretty good although they tend to be a bit bland. I prefer dumplings steamed but sometimes these fall apart on the plate so you\\'re just eating the empty dumpling. Next time I\\'ll probably try something different.-General Tso\\'s soy protein chicken: 4/5, I really like this dish. It\\'s typically served with some rice, mushrooms, onion, & green pepper. There could definitely be more \"chicken\" because they\\'re always a bit light on the portion but it is pretty damn delicious. -Hot & Sour Soup: 2/5, with the lunch special this is one of the soup options. It\\'s always a hit or miss when ordering this but it\\'s usually a miss here unfortunately. Very bland and watered down with not much flavor at all. I\\'d recommend trying one of the other options unless bland & watery is your thing.-Mango Pudding: 2/5, I love anything mango, so naturally I had to try the mango pudding. Unfortunately it was pretty much a slab of mango gelatin scooped right out of a can and thrown on a plate with a few strawberry\\'s. Bit of letdown, and I wouldn\\'t get it again.Overall I like this spot once in a while when I\\'m in the mood for Asian vegetarian. But it\\'s not a place I go out of my way for.

The short, elderly woman who answers the phone is absolutely out of her mind. She is so rude! Every single order is always a battle, but today's experience really took the cake.When we called today, we were told we could not use a credit card number to order over the phone because they were worried we were going to up and run off with $30 of food. Why? Their reasoning was because our building lease will be up soon. How absurd is that?? First off, that is untrue. Secondly, we have been ordering for years, and years and we are not strangers. We've never once paid a cent less than what we owed. So because of their bad experience with one bad customer who works in the same building, they have stopped all orders. You would think they would treat a repeat customer better, but despite years of honest ordering, we are accused of being a flight risk with paying a $30 meal??Green Zenphony, you have lost hundreds of dollars.

Benihana was kind of mainstay in South Florida for birthdays when you're a kid. Maybe it was an affluent Jewish thing, but we always went on the occasion, and it was so much fun, especially if you get a chef who's in the right mood and preforms for the dining audience at his table.On this night at Shogun, our chef was on fire (literally and figuratively). He played off our energy and did all the fun tricks that hibachi chef's like to do, such a flip the shrimp off the grill and into a guest's mouth (or at least try.) Lol. It was just the two of us seated at a table for 8 with others we did not know, which is half the fun of going to a hibachi restaurant. The service and the food were great.

I was a little nervous about it because I had dental work and needed soft foods that night, so I opted not to eat it. But Jayson gave me a bite of his steak and I was in heaven. It was perfectly cooked, and very tender. My shrimp and lobster were excellent. The food is big proportions. We ended up taking some home, which became a midnight treat.

The pork was well marinated and cut thinly, so it had tons of flavor.The grilled pork vermicelli ($13) was also good - the same pork from the grilled bahn mi was marinated which made the dish tasty.The clay pot Vietnamese beef stew ($15) was NOT good. There was hardly any sauce so the majority of the dish lacked flavor, but what made it inedible was beef was very, very dry...dry tasteless beef is not great. The side of vegetables (steamed yu choy w sauce) was actually really tasty. If I'm in LIC again, I may come back to order the bahn mi for takeout.

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Cyclo (#1), the rickshaw themed Vietnamese establishment has slowly become the go-to option in LIC for simply being only the game in town. A smart move on the part of the Thai folks who run the joint, considering the scarcity of Vietnamese cuisine and the demand for something remotely close to it. I tend to call it Vietnamese with a Thai twist (#2), which it most certainly is.The space is nicely decorated and modern enough to be the exact opposite of a hole in the wall. The interior is sun kissed with natural lighting from all angles and the contemporary decor makes this a nice option for both lunch and dinner for small groups. I personally think daytime is the best time to be here.I\\'ve come here with some Viet friends and have had some semi-embarrassing encounters with the staff where they actually couldn\\'t understand us when we ordered dishes right off the menu (#3). Turns out no one had ever pointed out how certain dishes (i.e. com ga nuong, bo luc lac) were pronounced. Yikes.The food is nothing to get hyped about, which is tough because I\\'ve tried a majority of the menu over the years. The presentation for most dishes and sandwiches are lovely and certainly the most photo worthy during daylight. I haven\\'t given the pho much thought after an initial try and I tend to avoid most of the noodle dishes as well as their banh mi. The curries and salads feel more Thai than they do Viet, but I imagine many folks wouldn\\'t know the difference.Then there are the prices, which are pretty steep. $13 banh mi? $19 super pho? $14 fried rice? $12-15 claypot bowls? That LIC rent is really something. I guess no one is coming here because they think it\\'s cheap, but I suppose in this hood, this *is* cheap.Ultimately, it\\'s hard to take this place seriously as a prime Vietnamese spot. I know Viet purists might scoff at the food or even the operation of the diligent Thai staff but what it really boils down to is the makeup of the food. Pho broth isn\\'t up to par. I am into the claypot and over-rice dishes, but that\\'s not really enough to make up for the rest of the food. The banh mi is solid but the bread is a bit too hard for the roof of my mouth. Plus, when you misspell it on the menu (aka good ol BAHN MI), the credibility goes right out the window.____________(#1) Or in Vietnamese, \"xich lo.\"(#2) In New York, most Viet joints are Chinese or Korean run. There are the few that are Viet Hoa Ky, but mainly cho-lon\\'ish (Chinese Viet?) (#3) Which in recent years has actually included the Viet names of certain dishes.',\n",

We were seated at a table that was freshly covered in what seemed like paper with a plastic coating for when you get messy with your seafood-boil. We ordered two happy hour drinks which were decent and we also ordered what we thought were the happy hour fried oysters for the table which was advertised on a chalkboard. (Will elaborate more on this)We ordered family style 3 combo boils shared amongst the four of us all medium spice level which we all felt was pretty spicy considering that all of us love spicy food. \\xa0all All in all the food was great.The only reason I'm shaving a star off is because we left the establishment a bit bitter.The oysters we ordered with our server were infact not the happy hour oysters. The server explained that the happy hour oysters came with fries but we didn't get that one we just got the larger 6 piece standard appetizer. Our server also had asked us if we would like to leave the head on our shrimp and we decided to order one of the boils without the head, he did not tell us upon giving us this option that removing the head is an extra $1.This was all realized once we got the check and explained after we questioned it.

I've visited several different seafood boil spots, some nearby are (blazin' cajun + hot n juicy) but I always find myself comparing it to shakin' crab! The chunkiness of the garlic with the spice level and salt are so mouth watering and definitely satisfy my seafood craving! My favorite deal is 1lb shrimp with 1/2lb mussels, I always leave full with half a bag in tow. I add the corn and rice on the side and my favorite flavor is the house shakin' sauce on the hot/spicy level. It's the 2nd to hottest and pretty spicy (nose running, mouth tingling and all that)! My friend got the cilantro lime and she said it was enjoyable but less spicy overall and she prefers the shakin' sauce. The crab was pretty good but not AS fresh as other places. The mussels were also very tasty and they shake the bag well enough so that spices and garlic coat everything including going inside the mussel shell. My friends have told me that the potatoes and sausage additions are not worth it because they don't give enough, so that's something to consider. Their portions are better than other places I've visited. Service can be a little better but I don't mind, they are busy and trying to juggle a lot at once. The bathroom was also clean and they gave use the proper utensils to have a delicious meal. Long story short, if you prefer a chunky sauce and love shrimp.. No more searching, this is the ONE.\",\n",

My friend that had ordered spicy one basically cried through the whole meal, so if you can't take spicy, get medium like me and it's still a bit spicy.Blue crabs were really tiny with bascially no meat in them.. shrimps and clams were also pretty small but they were tasty. Garlice noodles were just okay. But the garlic mac and cheese?! I've never tried garlic mac and cheese but this was one of the best mac and cheese I've ever tried!

The crab XLB has a strong crab flavor (almost suspiciously strong - hope it's from actual crab and not crab flavoring.) Chilled side dishes: chilled tripe was delicious and rich in spices. Only critique would be the numbing spice needs to be a lot stronger. Garlic cucumber was also great.

Alright back to this restaurant in NYC. All the items on the menu seem more breakfast type of food. What we ordered: Salted Soy Bean Curd: ($2.75) this tasted okay. Seem like they just threw it soy sauce on top of the soy bean curd. Scallion Pancake:($3.95) crunchy on the outside. Pan Fried Pork Buns: ($6.95) (6 pieces) order came out cold. Guess it's been sitting there for quite some time. Maybe we shouldn't have order this since we order dumplings. Rice cake with shredded pork and preserved mustard: ($7.95): basically what it states. Okay dish no wow factor to it. Shanghai Panfried Udon: ( $7.50) looked more like udon with beef and shanghai bak Choi. I like the Chinese style better with seafood. Steamed pork buns: ($6.50) not enough meat filling. Also we order crab too but when our order arrived, they messed up the order and gave us 2 pork dumplings instead of 1 pork and 1 crab.

It's a nice, loungey, set up with lots of space - it's a long restaurant with a fairly large bar. Our server was really nice and patient with my indecisiveness. We order a Charcuterie board with: Chorizo, Jamon Iberico, Salami, Pierre Robert cheese and still had one more option (5 things were $24 I think so that was a good deal)... our server recommended the blue cheese since it was a mild one and I'm SO happy we got it. It paired really well with the mustard, pickles, truffle honey + fig jam. I was in barcelona in January and what we had tasted/looked/felt like prosciutto so I wonder if it was Jamon iberico, but still good nonetheless. We actually enjoyed this so much that we would've ordered this again if we didn't already pre-order a paella. We got the octopus as well, and they were very generous with the portions (which is normally an issue at most places in general). I personally wished it was more charred and salty - I don't really remember much about this dish and that's nor really a great sign for me since my life revolves around food. Bone marrow was plentiful: big pieces with bread and sweet sautéed onions. I wasn't a fan of this, it was more oily than I would've liked and it was sweeter than I would've liked. I wish it was more salty than sweet.We got cavatelli with a veal ragu sauce - I didn't want this, but my sister did. It was a rich dish but not my favorite...decent and filling which was cool but wish it had more flavor. We got the patatas bravas, but they were massive potato wedges - crispy but not as flavored as I would've liked and it just wasn't good lol We were full from all the taste testing and forgot we ordered the paella: it was good but also bland. We also had a pitcher of sangria which maybe had 4-5 glasses of sangria which was yummy.

I live 1,850 miles south of this place in Texas and I felt like I never left when I walked into this place. \\xa0I can honestly say this was the best bar and grill I visited while I was in town. Being from Texas, I already stuck out like a sore thumb, but Karen and of course Tommy D made my fiance and I feel right at home. We literally walked in at 7pm and left close to 2am not because we were drinking all night, but because we were talking to everybody. \\xa0FOOD:ORDER THE WINGS with Donkey Sauce. \\xa0I also ordered the jackass burger. Both of these items were just 2 of the items off there great menu. Feeling brave? Try the Donkey Mess. Drinks:I'm a whiskey guy and usually drink Jameson, but Tommy recommended another Irish Whiskey called Tullamore Dew. I haven't touched Jameson since. They have all sorts of drinks to choose from, but I would recommend the Tully if you haven't ever had it. I went to Manhattan, \\xa0Coney Island, \\xa0Brooklyn and the Bronx to eat and have a few drinks during my visit, but none of those places held a candle to this place. \\xa0If you're looking for a place to hangout, \\xa0watch the game, \\xa0have some great food, great drinks, and to feel like family.....this is the spot to go to. Go in and tell Tommy that Texas sent you. Tommy D we will be back up there not for just sights of the city, but to come see you, Karen and the rest of y'all there.Brothers for life\",\n",

We walked in to karaoke and were a little unsure of how long we'd stay.....Then we met Tommy, the owner. He immediately put us at ease with humour and made us feel like regulars. People walked in and out all night, when people knew them they shouted their name, when they didn't they were cleared a space right at the bar. The Mad Donkey is exactly how I imagined a typical NY neighbourhood bar to be. Friendly, chill and low key. There's bras and bar taps on the ceiling and by doing a donkey challenge you can get your Polaroid up on the wall.

Mainly because I have been patronizing this place for over five years. I and friends have introduced this place and their fish bowls to numerous people and were so turned off by my most recent visit that I will never go back. My friends and I arrived around 1 am after grabbing some beers atSinglecut Brewery. Upon entering I immediately went to the bathroom, I was in there for no less than five minutes. However, when I came out the tall bartender who is also supposedly the owner approached my friends and me at the bar and with a nasty tone and lack of pleasantness told us \"You need to buy a drink at the bar or else leave\". I literally just walked up, one of my friends doesn\\'t drink and one of my friends DID order a drink. So his hostility at the jump was a HUGE turn-off. At that point, I just wanted to leave because I get that your bar was practically EMPTY but customer service would have gone a long way as I was about to buy a round for my friends that were drinking. I tried talking to the bouncer to express my frustration and discontent with the service and was met with a patronizing \"did we refuse service to you?\" I am not stupid and have worked in the restaurant business, basically, you wanted to act as if you all did your part when really you failed and prejudged my friends and I. \\xa0That was the most disheartening part of this experience the prejudgment that my friends and I weren\\'t going to spend money when we have so MANY times in the past.

Firstly, when we came in, we were greeted immediately and seated. We thought we would be the first ones since we got there 10 minutes into opening, but there was already another family feasting.

She did order chocolate chip French toast and when the order arrived it was regular French toast she didn't say anything and she just kept the French toast she was given. I didn't taste some french toast but she said it was good. I noticed the guy was making some shakes and it seems that this place is known for their shakes but what I did notice was that they were using a frosting to frost a glass.

But being a sucker for whole foods - I am not -- and once I tasted the side of Mashed Potatoes I was thinking that it was possible that the potatoes came from a box. Defended to a communication shut down level, server 1 was so miffed, as if I had personally offended him and everything he stood for with my question -- and in an effort to play pout police, I clearly stated my disinterest in mashed potatoes.

I'm not a fan of sangria but that restaurant is known for it so I had to try, after the first cup I wanted a pitcher. It was So good!!!!! . Their also known for there pollo (hence the name) so my husband ordered a whole chicken with rice and beans. The pollo was juicy and seasoned amd cooked well, however I wasn't a fan of the beans. As for my skirt steak, i ordered it medium well and it came hot and juicy, nice and Charred and made perfect. I absolutely enjoyed my steak and the red potatoes.

I used to come here because it had the best pork bone broth, with real pork bones tenderizing in the soup. Even Mikey Chen reviewed this restaurant prior to the changes made, and he raved about the broth.Here are the changes now:- pork bone broth noticeably lowered in quality- kimchi broth - no more seafood flavor with no more shrimps in the broth- portion sizes smaller- meat worse quality - more fat on fatty meat, tougher to chew on some meat- service and attentiveness declined (they don't take out the fatty soup part for you anymore)- the delicious lemony sauce base is no longer there. Now it's the typical soy sauce, sesame sauce, etc. that you create yourself- some menu items have gone awayThis used to be the best hotpot in Flushing.

Everything from waters, ordering, etc took FOREVER. First the soup came out, then meats, then veggies, then an assortment of everything else was place in a giant bowl. Did not look appetizing or fresh... They used to bring the sauce to you to make at the table, and now it's just a typical buffet style lined up in the front. Not that I ever ate the ice cream but it was a nice treat at the end. They got rid of that too. Servers are not attentive and you have to actually flag them down to get their attention.

It was actually pretty busy when I went too. The food came out pretty quick and there's a button on the side of the table to notify the staff whenever you need anything. My friends and I were attracted by the 30 skewers for $22 that had a variety of chicken, beef, and lamb but only after we received it, did we realize that they were small skewers. each skewer only had like 2 thin slices of whatever meat it was. We were craving some thick, juicy meat on the skewers. We also tried the beef noodle soup and the wonton soup. The beef noodle soup had a very beefy flavor and pretty good. The wonton soup came with lots of seaweed and cilantro. It was more on a lighter, cleaner broth side. The wontons were just decent. Overall, I would give them a 3.5. The food was not bad and I'm sure their regular skewers might be good but I don't recommend the 30 small skewers.

       "  'Positive Review 3': 'Sadly, Chinese BBQ is kind of hard to come by in NYC (though there are some in Manhattan Chinatown that are decent), so Flushing is one of your best bets for getting a quality experience. I love the cart skewers in Flushing, and I have to note off the bat that I don\\'t think this place beats my favorite cart. However, that\\'s not necessarily the point, as it\\'s a much different experience being able to sit down, relax, and receive service.BBQ here is a not a particularly quick meal, and it\\'s probably better this way. Orders come by themselves, so your meal could end up disjointed, but the benefit is that everything is hot (careful) when you get it. The flavors here, including their \"spicy,\" are not super strong. At the same time, it\\'s not like everything tastes the same here, which I do think is the primary pitfall of some other BBQ places. The meat is also very tender, which is one of the more impressive parts of their skewers... as much as I like cart skewers, they\\'re helped a lot by their selection of very fatty meat chunks, so one could argue it\\'s easier for them to make the meat tasty. The special lamb is probably worth the price compared to their 3 per order one, as that was the best skewer of my visit. The lamb and beef are both solid... I actually like their beef more than I usually like beef in skewers, but both of these skewers are on the smaller side. Chicken heart and gizzards were both solid, so I\\'d recommend those if you like them. The pork belly/enoki mushrooms were okay, as well as the pork intestine... maybe not something I\\'d strongly recommend? I\\'d probably be willing to get everything again, in addition to exploring the rest of the menu if I were to come again, and I have confidence that their menu is pretty strong across the board. I think prices overall are also very fair for you\\'re getting.Service is pretty great here, and they have the button at each table you can press if you need anything. This is probably a place where being able to speak Chinese helps out immensely (even when it comes to finding this place, as I believe \"Friendship\" on Yelp is probably the result of someone translating the restaurant name), as my entire restaurant experience was conducted in Chinese. Their menu does have English translations for everything but the specials though, so I presume one would be fine speaking only English too.Honestly, the hardest part of coming here is that you\\'ll likely have to pass by skewer carts on your way there and back, and so whether it\\'s a temptation to eat early or a feeling of regret afterwards that you didn\\'t spend your money there before, all I\\'m saying is no one\\'s going to judge you for inflating your skewer count.',\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"As much as I was excited to come here and give this place a good rating (because it is a friend's favorite spot) - the excitement died once we ordered and tasted our food. Not that it is an ultimate big deal but, we were all looking forward to lemon potatoes with our meal - it was around 8pm and they had ran out of them. The food was a mixture of good and bad - the dip platter was ok, our fish was TERRIBLE (sea bass) but the chicken kabob was okay and my friend had the octopus which she claimed to love. Wine wasn't great but they have Greek beer which is always a plus for me - crisp and cold! Service was friendly - Overall I was disappointed at their food quality. Perhaps I expected too much since my friend had hyped it up for us.\",\n",

Walking distance from the museum of the moving image, good, clean (vegan) food and beyond friendly and attentive service. \\xa0The meze option is the best all around here as you get to sample a lot of authentic Greek dishes. I assume it is meant for 3 or 4 people but we killed it between 2 although we left F-U-L-L! The restaurant is no fancy schmancy, but living and eating my way through tavernas in Greece for 6 months I can firmly say simplicity and freshness is key to Hellenic cuisine. As a carb lover I couldn't get enough of the pita and olive oil, but close seconds were the grilled eggplant, zucchini and olives, the hummus and beets! Last shoutout goes to the Rose tea!\"},\n",

He was the only server in a full house with all tables occupied. It was ultimately a one man show and he was doing a phonemonial job! So much patience even in a very hectic environment when he is constantly running back and forth to the kitchen and every table.When the food came, I quietly mumbled hmm hot sauce, he heard me and brought it out! That is A+ service. We enjoyed the XLB and rice cake dish! Prices are very reasonable.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"We visited Yu Garden Dumpling House largely due to the restaurant's Yelp cover photo of late celebrity chef Anthony Bourdain. Dishes We Had:- Crab and Pork Xiaolongbao: The dumplings here use a soy sauce-flavored soup filing, which seemed to mask any crab flavor in the meat filling, and which sharply clashed with vinegar dipping sauce traditionally paired with soup dumplings.- Yangzhou Fried Rice: Bland, and the rice was unevenly hard.- Crispy Noodles with Seafood: The noodles lacked crispness; the sauce was over-thickened with corn starch.Food: Meh (2 of 5). We've had better elsewhere.Service: OK (3 of 5). There is complimentary tea. Interestingly, this place does not do substitutions. One of our party wanted to substitute chicken for pork in a noodle dish, but the restaurant declined the accommodation. Most Chinese restaurants are amenable to such substitutions.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5).\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Yeah, I came here only because Anthony Bourdain talked about it on his show. \\xa0Maybe it was good back then, but now these soup dumplings are mediocre/average at best. \\xa0Crab soup dumplings barely had any crab taste to them. \\xa0Usually when I taste good soup dumplings, I go YUM!!! \\xa0But these didn't do anything for me. \\xa0After eating 2 dumplings, I didn't particularly want any more. \\xa0(Well that's a first! \\xa0Usually I want to stuff as many as I can into my face). \\xa0The soup inside the dumpling seemed very soy sauce laden. \\xa0Very salty. \\xa0Which didn't particularly go well with the vinegar dipping sauce.Most places give you a cover over the bamboo steamer of soup dumplings to keep it nice and hot. \\xa0This place did not. \\xa0None of the other customers in the restaurant had soup dumplings so I don't know if this is how they normally serve it. \\xa0Without a cover, the dumplings cooled off quickly and the top knot got a bit hard.Also ordered yang zhou fried rice. \\xa0Bland. \\xa0Nothing particularly tasty about it. \\xa0Needed some hot sauce to kick it up a notch.Across from the bathroom, there is a small sectioned off area, where you can see workers making soup dumplings.Important note: \\xa0 if you are thinking about checking this place out. \\xa0They refuse to do any protein substitutions. \\xa0I wanted to order chicken with pan fried noodles. \\xa0All they had was pork or seafood versions. \\xa0So I asked the waiter if I can have chicken substituted instead of pork pan fried noodles. \\xa0He said no, then quickly walked away. \\xa0How hard is it to throw some chicken in there instead of pork? \\xa0What's up with that? \\xa0I've never been in an asian restaurant that refused to do a simple protein substitution.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': 'My father and I were in the neighborhood and didn\\'t feel like driving further down Kissena towards Main. I saw \"Yu Garden\" and made the wrong assumption that it\\'s associated with Shanghai You Garden on 40th rd, which I\\'ve had fantastic dining experiences at. We went in, sat down, and ordered our food. The first dish that came out, drunken chicken, was the one that ruined our experience at this restaurant. I was very excited too as Shaoxing wine is one of my favorite flavors! My father and I looked at each other during our first bite with puzzled faces.... we both realized that the chicken was frozen!!! We spat it out and tried another piece, just to make sure we weren\\'t going crazy and maybe it was an isolated incident, but the second piece confirmed that indeed the chicken was frozen. I asked the waiter kindly to send it back and soon after, the chef/manager came out and had the audacity to explain to us that drunken chicken is a cold dish... This isn\\'t my first rodeo with Shanghainese cuisine; I ordered drunken chicken not frozen chicken! She kept on explaining why it was FROZEN (our refrigerator is on the fritz... UHM, NOT MY PROBLEM) and offered to microwave it for us... I kindly just asked to send it back as we wanted no part of that dish. The XLB was mediocre. The fried rice cake was way too saucy. When we asked for the bill, the waiter looked at me with a sad look in his eye... he knew I shouldn\\'t have been charged for the chicken, but alas, there it was on my bill. I knew it was futile to kill the messenger, so I asked to speak to the chef/manager lady again regarding the charge for FROZEN CHICKEN on my bill. She didn\\'t even bother showing her face this time and the waiter took the FROZEN CHICKEN off my bill. I will never be coming back. Bourdain (may God rest his beautiful soul) must be rolling in his grave for filming an episode of Parts Unknown here as I\\'m sure he would not have enjoyed the food and service I experienced tonight.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': 'A friend had a craving for beef scallion pancakes so we came here. Quoted a 25 minute wait and we waited about 15 which was nice. They brought around water/tea/cookies while we waited which was great customer service.It was a bit odd that we had to order before we were even seated so it put us on the spot a bit but would rather food come out quicker so it wasn\\'t a big deal.We ordered 2 orders of beef scallion pancakes, rice cakes with seafood, and 2 orders of pan fried dumplings. They were nice enough to bring us free soup dumplings along with free dessert. Never had the rice dumpling soup dessert before but it was phenomenal. It was very nice of them to provide.The ONLY reason why I took off a star is because the restaurant has poor ventilation. The four of us were seated in the back and while we were waiting for the check smelled the most VILE smell coming from the bathrooms. It was enough to make you gag and break dinner etiquette because it was so bad no one could ignore it. Everyone at the table had a laugh about how the person probably needed to see a doctor because that type of smell shouldn\\'t come from a healthy human being. Regardless it\\'s a bathroom so \"sh*t happens\" (literally) but if their bathrooms are going to be so close to the tables they need to have better ventilation or keep a bottle of fabreeze or something in there because I likely would have thrown up at the table had I not already finished eating if I would have smelled that earlier. This doesn\\'t put me off from coming back but I will make a point to be asked not to be seated in the back again.',\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': \"Like most of the Yelp reviewers here, we too were suckered into coming here because of the late Anthony Bourdain's visit to this Flushing restaurant. So many people held and still hold Anthony Bourdain in such high regards that they'll follow his food path to the end of the world, including myself, but in this case it might have been a poor decision.First off, as of May 2019, the restaurant had a C health inspection rating, so beware that you're really eating at your own risk here, which we did. If you see the C on the window and still go in, prepare for the worst, but hope for the best. But mostly say a prayer first.We arrived here at around 6:30pm on a nice Saturday evening and the restaurant was pretty quiet. Aside from the dismal health inspection rating, one reason for the lack of customers might be the fact that the restaurant is really out of the way and far from what many people deem to be the central point of Flushing. Service was consistent throughout as the one waiter and one waitress were swift, quick and cordial. The menu was just like any other Shanghainese restaurant with almost the same type of items, so we ordered the same things that we typically ordered:Marinated Gluten - aka Kao Fu. First, we had a bit of a hard time finding Kao Fu on the menu until my wife realized this was it, but just named differently. Besides the name, it was odd-looking compared to other restaurants. It had a spongy texture to it and did not have the same flavor as other restaurants. To be honest, it wasn't that appetizing. At first, it was, but we were starving. However, a few pieces into it and we were done with it and couldn't go for it anymore.Shredded Jellyfish - was OK. Nothing noteworthy. Was an average dish of shredded jellyfish. It did come out very quick along with the Marinated Gluten, which meant this was probably sitting somewhere for a while. Crab and Pork Soup Dumpling - I thought the soup dumplings were solid, but it could have been a bit warmer when they arrived. The skin was thin, so they were very, very fragile. I didn't think it was an issue, but my wife wasn't a fan of them.Fried Udon with Spinach and Shredded Pork - Absolutely disappointing. Probably the worst fried udon noodle dish we ever had at a Shanghainese restaurant. The noodles were drenched in soy sauce and there was barely any pork. There were a few pieces of spinach, but literally that was it. Nothing else was in the dish to add a little more flavor. I guess they thought the soy sauce would do the trick.Pan Fried Soup Dumpling - Probably the best dish we ordered, but it was still rather average. The soup in most of the dumplings were dried up against the skin, so there wasn't much soup at all, so it made for a rather mushy breading.Like I said, I would follow Anthony Bourdain's food suggestions to the end of the world, but Yu Garden was so disappointing. Maybe our sky high expectations were a factor, but the moment we saw that C on the window, we knew we were in for something not so good. We should have turned around then.\"},\n",

They were both terrible and way too chewy. When I tried one of the steaks I thought we got the piece that was mostly fat but they both were horrific. I doubt I'm coming back here in the near future.

Composed of a fried egg , bacon jam, maple aioli on top of their signature blend beef patty - the Edison found a special place in my heart!

I can not describe how much happiness and surprise my mother, and all of our family and friends responded to the cake. Everyone thought it was a real bag!!! Not only was the cake delicious and exactly how I pictured, the staff was friendly and polite. I spoke to Javier, who was an amazing help!!! He listened, and really took his time to go over the cake and the design with me. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS BAKERY and will definitely be back for more cake designs!!!\",\n",

Dont be fooled by the spicy levels, there are times the very mild is too spicy, but that could be the slight inconsistency of the cooking. So just be careful with that. My party ordered the assorted rice cakes with a load of sides, their kimchi fried rice with cheese and their cheese ribs. (Make sure to eat the cheese hot, or else it'll just be a clumpy mess). We got very mild for the rice cakes and ribs and they were very good. The ribs were not spicy at all and the rice cakes were just right for me and my friends. Maybe next time we'll move up a level. As for service, it was busy but the waitresses were very quick and attentive. The food came out super fast too which was a huge plus for us. Overall great place for good food!

I came here with a group of 4 for a late lunch and we were seated immediately in the center of the airy, spacious dining area. The interior was lovely, fillled with gorgeous paintings of Greece, dolphins and more. Though it was a little on the loud side, we were still able to hear one another without having to raise our voices. The ambiance was cheerful with a feeling of calm, due to the blue lighting and the white / blue color scheme. We were served complimentary garlic bread which was thick and warm, however a bit tough. My friends ordered a side of beets and Greek salad, along with their meal. I tried a bit of both and they were tasty and fresh. The beets were soft with nice herb seasoning. The Greek salad consisted of crunchy lettuce, red onion, tomatoes, olives and plenty of crumbled feta cheese. There was olive oil, vinegar and pepper for the dressing - Simple, yet delightful. For my main course, I decided to go with the grilled salmon with lemon potatoes, which was absolutely delicious - Perfectly cooked, made with olive oil and seasoned with oregano. The ingredients were not complicated but everything mingled together so well. The salmon was wonderfully tender, slightly crispy, very juicy, and mouthwateringly flaky. It was a generous size and the price of $23 was reasonable. The lemon potatoes were served on a separate plate and pretty enjoyable. It had a distinct lemon and peppery flavor and was smooth. We were given free dessert of galaktoboureko, a traditional Greek dessert of semolina custard in phyllo dough. This was incredibly delectable! It was flavored with a hint of orange and tasted of custard, thin phyllo and very sweet syrup. It was divine! Our waiter was great - Friendly and knew the menu well. One thing to keep in mind is that the food takes awhile to prepare, probably because they cook everything fresh so I didn't mind too much. However, it is best to come when you have plenty of time to fully enjoy the feast you order. I would definitely return, as there are so many yummy sounding offerings on the menu.\",\n",

When i found out they had gluten free options i was stoked; my favorite gluten free pizza spot in Williamsburg closed down and I was hoping this could be a replacement. Sadly, i was slightly disappointed. I got the Houdini Green (the one with the veggies), and thought it tasted...almost flavorless. I drizzled the chili pepper oil, added some pepper, and still could barely get it to taste great. The crust, was hard in some places and soft in the others, veggies were over-grilled, and the sauce was lacking flavor.I've heard great things about their pizza so maybe it's just their gluten free pizza that's a bust? What i did love about this spot was that it was kind of hidden. It doesn't draw much of a crowd on the weekdays which can be great if you just want to chill and enjoy someone's (or your own) company.

So that's misleading and lame, right? Ordered more sauce paid 2$ for 2 oz of sauce. If I'm already spending 19$ on a calzone if should come with sauce. the food was all meh nothing great, nothing worth coming back for.

Glad that they execute it so well and make my first try a good one. I ordered Patacon Paisa and also got a free Tequeno from Yelp check in. Both items were awesome!!!i'm not usually big on cheese but the Tequeno is tasty! it's basically fried dough with cheese filling. it was served warm, the dough has the right chewiness, the cheese wasn't too strong, it tasted even better with the sauces. it definitely made a great appetizer.Patacon is basically a sandwich with flattened plantain as bun instead of bread and I think it's great! i went for Paisa because I don't want any cheese. the fillings for Paisa were really tasty, saucy, and the flavor works together well. generous meat. decent portion too overall. I really enjoyed the meal. the price was not bad. service was very friendly. note that there's minimum $10 if you want to use card. i'm excited to come back and try the other dishes especially arepas\",\n",

For a while they had change the menu and added some Taiwanese dishes which worked in my favor because I can satisfy several cravings at one time. Usually the stinky tofu, the oyster omelette, and the Mee Goreng. The restaurant was closed for almost 4 months and after they reopened I went back and everything tasted different. I assume they had to hire a new chef due to the long closure but it was truly disappointing. The stinky tofu was not crispy, wasn't very stinky, and the preserved vegetables served on the side had not been preserved very long and had no flavor. However, the sauce was still really good. The Mee Goreng didn't have the kick like before and it tasted just like a Chinese lo mein and there was one shrimp in the entire dish. It is usually a mix of different things but there are usually at least four shrimp so this dish was kind of sad besides not tasting the way it supposed to.They really need to bring back the old chef or find someone who actually knows how to cook the original Malaysian dishes or I fear that they will probably close again but this time for different reasons.\",\n",

Recommend 'feasting' so you're able to try all the dishes they whip up, with some rotating out seasonally. The rolls of injera flatbread were a perfect vehicle for picking up the nine dishes (they come in little mountains on a MASSIVE feast platter) - bouncy, tart sourdough to net the rich savoriness.

Apparently the platter for three was more than enough food for a group of 5. So, we got the full combination of nine different sides made up of all sorts of things, collard greens, ground lentils, beans, pickled veggies, etc. The platter itself was served all at once and had a repeat of the sides on each side of the plate. It helped save us from having to rotate the dish. The fermented flatbread to pick up the sides was, as you'd expect, a little sour (I believe its actually sourdough based) but not so sour as to upset your stomach. We did end up needing an extra side of bread but it was well worth it. So why 4 stars? Ethiopian isnt my favorite cuisine but it was well seasoned and had a nice balance of flavors. Additionally, when I've had the flatbread in the past, I've gotten upset stomachs quite quickly afterwards. The bread here has a nice balance of flavor and fermentation which added to the dishes and made it easier on my stomach. Will give it a try again in a few months!\",\n",

On the right hand side you have your roast meats and wonton noodles, on the left hand side you have sushi. Where's the duck??I found this stall only because they posted two big photos of Peking duck buns on the back wall labeled with the price tag $1.25. I wasn't sure where to order but I figured making eye contact with one of the Asian ladies has got to do it. It's crowded here so you won't be able to eat inside. I ordered two buns and they packed it to go with plenty of napkins. Before I left, I heard another couple order 10 more! The buns were pretty soft, sauce was good and they were generous with the duck. You really can't beat the price!

So I suggested getting peking duck buns, and Yelp led me here. The store is tucked in the back behind other mini shops. You will know when you see the peking duck poster! For $1.25, you cannot beat the price! I have had peking duck buns in restaurants before, and they barely give you any meat. Here, you get the full packaged deal: the skin, the meat, chives, and plenty of hoisin sauce. Compared to other places, the ratio of bread to stuffing was perfect! And the taste of the crispy skinned meat with soft bread was delicious! I will definitely go back again the next time I need a quick bite!\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 1': \"During our most recent trip to NYC, we stumbled upon a random street fair with vendors all around. One of these vendors was a Peking Duck sandwich place with ridiculous prices (2 for $10). Knowing that we were going to make a stop in Flushing, we opted to find a Peking Duck sandwich place in Flushing instead to satisfy our craving. And, that's where Peking Duck Sandwich Stall comes into play - the location was kind of hard to find (it's in Corner 28 in the way back). I would say, be prepared to have a Chinese speaker with you (seems like they prefer Mandarin but they understand Cantonese fine). At $1.25 a piece, it's hard to complain, but this isn't somewhere you should go out of your way to try. The skin on the duck wasn't crispy, and the baos were nice and soft, but the only flavor that you could taste is just hoisin sauce. Perhaps if we read these reviews prior to trying it, we might have enjoyed it more with less sauce. Even still, the duck is not the hero of this dish and that's just a plain shame. Cash only.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 2': \"I wasn't too impressed by the Peking duck sandwich. The flavor was fine, but the meat to bao ratio was low, so it tasted overwhelmingly of just bao.

There is plenty of seating upstairs so you can pick what you like and sit down to eat.\",\n",

I ordered a SmokeShack (which I accidentally called it SmokeShake which the cashier politely corrected) as well as a small lemonade. Keep in mind that the cashier location is near the entrance to the rest of the mall and it used to the previous location of Urban Outfitters. There seems to be four separate lines to stand in to order and then after ordering, I was given a buzzer to let me know when my order would be ready for pick up. While I was waiting, I found a high seat in a table with others and sat down to wait for my food. When the buzzer went off, I went back to the counter but my food still wasn't ready yet. So I awkwardly stood at the counter and waited a few more minutes before a tray with my meal was placed on the table. When I touched the tray, it was wet and it was a bit large for holding just a single burger and a drink. After getting back to my seat, I took a bite out of the SmokeShack and it was a little disappointing compared to other SmokeShack that I've had in the past at other locations. More specifically, the temperature of the burger wasn't warm and the bacon tasted a bit dry. Given that the price of the meal was overly expensive compared to the taste of the burger, I would personally consider going to another location instead and pass on this one.\"},\n",

But, I feel it is probably more of a two-star. There are likable things about this place. I\\'m just at a loss for hone in on what they are.And, honestly, I don\\'t remember the last time I\\'ve seen Jayson this unhappy with a dining choice. It\\'s a shame too, I\\'ve had this place bookmarked for a while and was excited about finding a new spot in this \\'hood. Truth is, we only had oysters and salads. Who screws that up? But, I\\'d be less than fair if I didn\\'t give half the credit for today\\'s horrible experience to Sam, who gave new meaning to the phrase \"bad waiter.\"We literally were one of two tables. At least in Sam\\'s section. When we got there, right after the lunch special stopped, we were the only customer. And Sam, at first, was incredibly hospitable. He was pleasant, funny and very inviting. What went wrong from there is anyone\\'s guess.About 10 minutes after we sat, I ordered a dozen oysters. Then about 15 minutes after that we ordered two Caesar salads and I ordered a French onion soup. It doesn\\'t get more basic than that.Ten more minutes go by and he brings us our salads. I would have appreciated the oysters first. That\\'s why we ordered them immediately. But okay. Not the end of the world. No biggie.That said, the oysters still didn\\'t come out for another 20 minutes, that\\'s more than 30 minutes after we ordered them. It was completely unacceptable, especially since the dining room was empty, except for the second table that had arrived. Maybe this would make sense if we were drinking. But, we don\\'t drink. So, I doubt they were held so I could enjoy my water and Jayson his Sprite. Of course, that got me wondering if this was one of those times that the waiter dismissed us as worthy when we didn\\'t order liquor. I hindsight I wish those oysters never came. They were horrible. First, they weren\\'t cleaned well. \\xa0Most of them had crap in them, which is never a good sign. And, not surprisingly, I got sick after, throwing up all night. Now, we would have tried to discuss this with our waiter, but he dispersed, never coming back to us. Never checking in on us. He buzzed around to the other table, but always use the pathway that goes to them, and completely overlook us three tables over.Finally, we asked a woman, who works there, to get our check. And now an hour into this, and still not having gotten my French Onion Soup, we told someone else to cancel the soup. Were they out in the field harvesting the onions and milking the cow for the cheese?Suddenly our MIA waiter appears, with the soup (and a huge attitude) and gets pissed off when we point out that it\\'s been over an hour and we no longer want the soup. At this point, all we want to do is get out of this hell hole. He was like, \"but it\\'s here.\" And, we were like, \"but it\\'s been over an hour, and we\\'ve been done with everything for 20 minutes.\"There was no need for his nasty attitude or dismissiveness. He was even more unprofessional by sending someone else over with our check and going out of his way to continue ignoring us and act like a petulant child. Look, this isn\\'t the worst place in the world, which is why I couldn\\'t leave one star. Our experience was horrible. But, for people who drink, it\\'s probably a half-decent spot. The menu looks like they offer a lot, so there\\'s hope. Would I recommend it? No. Would I actively tell people not to go? No. I\\'m hoping ours was just a bad experience and not entirely representative of the restaurant as a whole.',\n",

We enter the restaurant and the bartender told us we could sit wherever we wanted. The restaurant was deserted and we soon found out why. Then Sam, our waiter comes over very quickly and it was 4:01pm. The lunch menu ends at 4. We asked if we could still have the lunch menu and he came back with a line of the lunch chef has already put everything away and the dinner chef is the one cooking now. Ummmm. We ordered a dozen oysters (28.95), two side ceasar salads (6.50) and french onion soup. He brought the salads out immediately. But we waited until our oysters came out (15 minutes later) The salads \\xa0were drenched with dressing. I was going to say something but he never came back to check on us. I ate maybe 5 bites of salad and I couldn\\'t eat anymore because it was just too soggy. The oysters were disgusting. They had a hard piece of, I want to say gristle, ( that\\'s the best way I can describe it) and they were inedible. Certainly not worthy of the hefty price. Then I saw the bartender and asked for the check. Sam comes over with they french onion soup we had ordered about 20-25 minutes prior. I told him that we didn\\'t want it anymore because it took too long. He looked at me and with a attitude said \"but it has already been made\". I told him that it took too long and if he bothered to check on us he would of known that our entire meal was disgusting. He walks away and a minute or two later he comes back with our check. He just puts it on our tables and walks away. I put our card in it and when he comes back to pick it us still says nothing. He then drops it off and again of a word. I was furious but I just wanted to get out of there as fast as possible. We had a horrible experience and I absolutely do not recommend this restaurant. I am a server and I know that you check back on people to see how they are doing, how their food is and if something is wrong on my end, you apologize and try to correct the error. Honestly just go to the movie theater and but popcorn. At least the people are friendly. Thanks Sam for a memorable experience that I hope I can soon forget.'},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"The number of Croatians and Bosnians in the Astoria / LIC area has always been significant, but amidst all the businesses catering to the Balkan community, Cevabdzinica Sarajevo has somehow remained the most well known of them all. The place is tiny, with just enough tables for lunch dates and solo dining. The interior is dated as well, but I think that just adds more charm of the place. While big group dining is possible, it would be recommended to that party to 4 max.Many folks are coming here for the cevapi, a balkan grilled minced meat, which has been the restaurant's claim to fame. It is after all, the national dish of several countries (#1) and where better than to get them in Queens? Typically they're served with a flatbread and a pile of onions, feta cheese, sour cream, and some other condiments. The cevapi here I believe is Bosnian based, hence the use of the beef. The bottom line? It's really tasty and I highly recommend it.But as they say with most good restaurants, that's not the only thing. I love their sarma, which is stuffed cabbage and it comes with lots of sauce and potatoes. Whenever they bring a fresh burek (stuffed with anything), I have to have it. I would also say that the mixed grill for 2 is a good value for major meat lovers and any of their kebabs (especially the chicken) is excellent. Don't sleep on the gulash either, the beef stew really comes through. (#2)The guys running the show are super nice. They're not the best on the phone but are generally quite friendly. Prices are a little steep for the amount of food one gets, but this is LIC. I wish there were more places like this, but beggers can't be choosers.

My wife had heard about this place thru some co workers so we decided to give it a try. Parking is mostly metered but there might street parking on the side streets but this place is already on a side street. We went on a Monday early evening and we were lucky enough to find a metered spot right away. The restaurant itself is quaint but decent sized. Two seating sections and they have a bar as well. There\\'s a big flat screen in the main dining area where we sat. I didn\\'t get a look at the other section which was separated by a half wall. Being a Monday night it wasn\\'t busy and we were able to pick our own table which is nice. Service was good and they start you off with some chimi churri sauce and bread. We got a salad for both of us as an appetizer and we both also had the small skirt steak. Both were very good. The steak as actually decent sized for the small one and it was pretty good. We\\'ll definitely be back. I want to try the mixed grill plates here.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I thought that one of my friends had recommended this place to me, but it was my imagination. It was a happy accident. The food is terrific. You start off with some warm bread and herby chimichurri. We ordered the Sangria pitcher and a Margarita. I'm sure that their website says that their Margaritas are famous all over town, but that Sangria was the one that you want to get. It's overloaded with fruits that complement amazingly well with the red wine. It's sweet, but not artificially or overly so. You can finish it easily, and have the fruits left over for dessert.I got the Large Argentinian Grill with the Chorizo, Morcilla, Tira De Asado, Molleja, Chinchulin and Entraña- a sample of most grill items. The chorizo was pretty salty, which was to be expected, but the morcilla(Blood sausage) was surprising also salty. The spices of the morcilla were definitely unique and nicely pungent, though. The rest of the meats were just a tad over cooked(past medium when medium rare was requested), but still tasted fairly good. The char from the grill was easily recognized, covering at least half of each piece, which could either be a good or bad thing, depending on your taste. If you're getting sides, skip the French Fries Provenzal, even though it's the most expensive one. They're thin fries topped with small bits of garlic that don't really disseminate or bring much flavour to the fries. Mashed Potatoes were standard.The real star of the meal, however, was the Family-sized Shrimp and Avocado Salad. The shrimp was fresh and plump, with the avocado to act as somewhat of a sauce to combine the two together. Onions, watercress, and a delicious vinaigrette to cut through the fattiness of the avocado. Food was great, parking was free(which is usually a terrible hassle for me when in Elmhurst), waiters were polite and accommodating, and live music with an old-school environment with random photos hanging on the walls. It's a great place to check out. Just save it for occasions, because this place is not at all cheap.\",\n",

Each ordering the Small Skirt Steak with shareable sides of Avacado Salad & Shrimp, spinach, broccoli and mashed potatoes, the meal came to us quickly, as did my warm Negro Modello. Warm dark beer just has no place especially sitting next to what appeared to be a great steak.The Avacado Salad was fifteen dollars --- maybe one Avacado and maybe four shrimp -- it was a unfair price for such a pitifully poor appetizer.My medium rare cook temp came out more like Pittsburgh -- or Black and Blue if you prefer upon the very first cut, clearly an error. I made no noticeable quark and cut thinner slices as the meat was tougher than I would have thought and I'd still be there chewing if not for matchboom sized incisions-- it was an unfortunate surprise. The sides were really terrible, definate frozen broccoli, most likely frozen spinach and definitely -- instant mashed potatoes. The sign of a once great restaurant that now has the name and the customer base to take shortcuts and maximize profits. So sad was I after being so excited walking in, hearing all the positive experienced -- a terrible failure across the board I am pained to report.\"},\n",

The Agnanti wraps were also a great call, when you hear wrap you\\'d think of an actual wrap but \"no\" this is fried phyllo stuffed with feta cheese and chopped bacon. *Party In My Mouth* the flavor combination between the feta and the bacon was just perfect.

Since then, it has been my first stop from the airport whenever I visit NY. \\xa0Their nova spread is amazing, the salmon cream cheese is a little fishier, tofu cream cheese tastes freakn vegan-friendly amazing but my all time favourite will forever and always be Bacon Scallion on Everything bagel, toasted with cheese, onion and tomato. That said!!! the amount of cream cheese they add has definitely decreased since a few years ago. plus the server is different every time so their bagels are always inconsistent. I dont want to say they skimp out but I am so passionate about their cream cheese that my mood of the day literally depends on the amount of spread I find when i dig into the brown paper bag and unwrap my bagel. Back in the days I would get the same guy every time and he\\'d know my order as soon as I walked in. the amount cream cheese was absolutely ridiculous and i loved every second of it, now its a hit or miss, kind of like bagel roulette.Bottom line, i love this place so much i can write a thesis on their bagels. please do yourself a favour and get yourself a bagel right. now. they\\'re open :)',\n",

The selection here is pretty extensive and even includes a French toast bagel (which was unfortunately appalling) and lots of other breakfast items. Considering I got a lox bagel for less than $10 with a more than adequate amount of lox in it, I might be harsh with a 2 star rating. However, if the price point is the only thing a place has going for it, it probably isn\\'t worth it.First, the lox was just off. It didn\\'t taste like it had gone bad or anything of that sort, it just didn\\'t taste how lox is supposed to taste. Lox isn\\'t cheap, everyone knows that. But it\\'s not meant to be. I would rather opt for a $15 bagel from Russ and Daughters any day versus a $8.50 bagel from here. Real lox should melt in your mouth, and this one was chewy and unsatisfying. On top of that, my bagel wasn\\'t toasted either. And yes, I did ask for it toasted (who doesn\\'t eat a bagel toasted)? Adding on to the dislike of bagels here- the French toast bagel sealed the deal for me. Please, can someone explain to me why in the world a bagel should be sticky? I get it, it\\'s \"French Toast\" but that doesn\\'t mean that a bagel should be smothered in syrup. I had high hopes when I saw that they carried them here as the bagel shop near me (Hand Rolled Bagels) doesn\\'t have them regularly (only as a flavor of the month on occasion). Maybe Hand Rolled raises the standards too high on a French Toast bagel for me, but this was just a major miss. Sticky, tough to chew, and, most importantly, didn\\'t even really resemble French Toast. I wouldn\\'t come back here as the only redeeming quality about this place is the price point- but let\\'s just say their price point is low for a reason.',\n",

Salmon and plantains were delicious, the octopus in the paella was a little rubbery. From the rotisserie I had chicken hearts, sirloin with garlic and pork sausage. The sirloin was flavorful and on the fatty side, which I loved. Chicken hearts and sausage were great too. My boyfriend had the beef ribs and they were a little tougher.

Love the name of this place since I know one Kilogram in the metric system is equivalent to 2.2 pounds. It's quite easy to fill up your plate with that much food since it's so good. The selection of churrascaria is pretty sweet and since you pay per the pound you are in complete control, the more you pile on the more you pay. I dislike flat rate AYCE buffets where some people stack their plates to the top and end up throwing most of it away. Listen all you AYCE foodies out there, you can make more than one trip to the buffet line, please dont waste food! Sorry, I had to vent.Dining here is easy, pick up a plate and survey the food bar. The day I went they had paella, shrimp in gravy, pernil, sausage, oxtail, plantains, yucca, chicken lasagna, beans and a few other goodies. The carving station had all the usual churrascaria items you would find in a Brazilian steakhouse. I had the lamb and skirt steak.After you completed filling your plate they will weigh your food and bill you after you finished eating. They have a pretty decent amount of adult beverages to choose from and a open bar as well. The food is seasoned well and the best part of the whole experience is the meats are cooked perfectly. They will carve as much or as little as you like on to your plate. Definitely worth the price as other speciality supermarkets and delis charge pretty much the same per pound for lack luster food.

Crazy Willy\\'s seemed to have everything I wanted (food, drinks, and hookah). We arrived to find only a few patrons at the establishment. I hoped that I hadn\\'t made a mistake in judgement. There was one waitress working and she told us we could grab a table anywhere. We opted not to sit in the front where you could look out through the big open windows because the streets were calm and quiet, so there wouldn\\'t be any \"people watching\" at this time of night. We grabbed a table in the corner and looked over our menus. There were so many items, which made my decision difficult. However, I was able to narrow it down to a calamari appetizer, and a churrasco skirt steak, sautéed with garlic, rice, and beans for my entree. My coworker ordered the fried pork with Caribbean sauce, and sweet plantains. We also asked for a pitcher of sangria. The waitress seemed a little flustered by our orders in the beginning, but as the night went on I realized there was a small language barrier. We received our sangria. It was fantastic. Not too sweet, just the right amount of fruit and alcohol. Our meat arrived later. We inquired about our sides, which arrived a few minutes later. The waitress asked if we wanted anything else. We inquired about the calamari appetizer. She said, \"oh, that\\'s coming later.\" We asked if we could cancel the appetizer and just enjoy our entrees, she obliged. My steak, rice, and beans were absolutely FANTASTIC!!!! The chef made a fresh garlic sauce that bursted with flavor. The rice and beans were a standout all on their own. I kept eating my beans well after my rice and steak were gone. My coworker was in amazement after he took his first bite of pork. He said the flavor was unlike anything he ever had. He also spoke highly of the sweet plantains. We decided to grab hookah here as well. The waitress advised that they only had mint hookah that evening, we didn\\'t \\xa0mind.

I asked to be moved multiple times, since they had OBVIOUS open tables. The waiter didn\\'t understand sh*t we were saying-- and kept saying the table is for 6, but we were 6 at the moment! And if you\\'ve ever been here, the long table seating can fit at least 12. \\xa0Our drinks took more than 40 minutes to come out. Our food-- oh my god. About an hour! I asked the waiter when the food will be out and he swear to god said \"what do you want there\\'s two people working there just wait\"-- so rude! And when it came out, sh*t was undercooked. I asked to take it back and the waiter looked at me so nasty. Like b*tch I\\'m not going to eat this raw meat! On top of that, the burger was legit mini sized in a huge bun! Wtf bro!

We got there a little bit before open at 11am and there was already a couple groups there waiting to get in! We got a table right away and had amazing service from there. Out waiter stopped by and immediately asked if we wanted to do the bottomless brunch. A minute later he was back with glasses for drinks. From there he continuously showed up to top off our glasses. It was never empty! We were able to switch between mimosas, Bellinis and bloody marys. The Bellinis and mimosas were boozy! There was just a touch of juice in each and mostly bubbly which is exactly how my friends and I like them. Definitely worth the $21!For food, I got the shakshuka and my friends got the avocado toast, breakfast waffle sandwich and the California egg scramble. The shakshuka was good but didn't taste like anything special or different than I could have made at home or had tried anywhere else. My friends all seemed pretty happy with their food.The environment of this place was the icing on the cake. It got busy right away and they were bumping great music.

So I ask for the check and a box and the waitress just brings over the check and before I could even open my mouth to ask for a box, she walks off. For literally over 15 mins. During this time there are 3 other employees standing there \"checking ID\\'s\" who I tried to flag down to bring me a box, but they just kept ignoring me. So every 5 mins I reduced the tip on the check til finally she returned and I had to ask for a new one. And I asked for a to go box, yet again. So what did she do? Grabbed my food and then walked off for another 5 minutes. Do you seriously think I ate it then? Get it together.

Although poke in Hawaii usually consists of marinated fish and rice, the combos offered here allow you to enjoy the fish just as much since the other components of the bowl pair together so well. The Wave bowl I ordered had salmon, wave sauce, onion, cucumber, edamame, cilantro, masago, seaweed salad, and kani salad. I could tell the salmon was very fresh from its color, lack of a fishy taste and smoothness. I loved how the flavors complemented each other and that I could enjoy my meal comfortably in a space with plenty of seating.

As we are currently planning a trip to Greece, we figured we should go to an authentic Greek restaurant to eat some food, drink some beverages, and have a great time.My aunt made a reservation for Saturday evening. That afternoon (the same day as our reservation) the restaurant called to say they had someone reserve the inside so we would be seated outside. We had made this reservation almost two weeks in advance. It's ridiculous that someone was able to swoop in and just grab the entire interior when they had a book full of reservations already confirmed. We arrived and sure enough the inside was packed with a birthday party. Someone on the staff gave us a table outside which ended up being fine but it was muggy out and we would have preferred to be seated indoors.The waitress who gave us our complimentary pita and cheese dip only spoke Spanish and told us this when we went to place a drink order. Luckily my boyfriend is fluent so we got that straightened out. Soon the manager Nico ended up taking care of us and he profusely apologized for having us seated outside. We ended up ordering a bunch of mezes to share. Some favorites were the sausage (so good with an ice cold beer), the pork bites (the sauce is amazing!), and the greens (simple but very good). The potatoes with feta were just french fries with feta on top - good but not worth ordering again. The octopus is something we all typically love but the large order is overpriced for a small piece of octopus with little seasoning. For dessert they brought us cheesecake for my aunt's birthday.Overall if you want real deal Greek food this is the spot, however, beware of the reservation process and the language barrier with some of the wait staff. If this were to happen again with us being forced to sit outside I would honestly bump this review down to three stars.\",\n",

We started with \\xa0Horiatiki, a tomato and cucumber salad. Get the medium to share. We then had the cheese sampler. Yes it had more feta, but it was fantastic. I love halloumi and the other selection, I believe it was Saganaki, was fantastic. Then came the Pikilia, a meat sampler with fries.

The Queens Midtown tunnel is also close by if you take the 495.

Sure, it's dine in only, but they do a good job keeping it clean and fresh. (It could be a tad spicier)* The fact they make their tortillas in house. Nothing delights me more than seeing the ladies grill their tortillas like their life depended on it.* The fast delivery. I am never waiting long for much here. * The cheesy options. As in they will add Qaxaca cheese to just about anything you want. * The fact they serve picaditas, tlacoyos, sincronizadas, and an impressive array of tortas.The staff here is awesome.

On a cold day, there are very few restaurants that I would prefer over Geo Si Gi.If it's your first time, order a #1, #2 or #3. Only difference is fresh vs. dried vs. pickled vegetables. The portions here are very large and you certainly get your money's worth. Just order one size smaller than you think you can eat and no food will go to waste. However, do add a noodle (ramen, udon, etc.) and ask for fried rice when you are done with the casserole. They will cook it in the same pot, which will pick up all the flavors still left on the bottom.If you need more food, order the Jok Bal, which is steamed pork leg. Order the smaller portion, it's plenty for four. This huge plate of super tender pork with skin and all that gelatinous goodness is always a hit. Dip it in the mildly spicy soy based sauce and let the party begin in your mouth. More food? Just order a Seafood Pancake like everyone else.Service is always friendly and they have parking through a driveway on the left side of the restaurant. That's a winner combination.

The filling is good, but the pastry is great, flaky but also a little soft and gummy, excellent texture***^ Steamed sticky rice chicken wrapped in lotus leaf is pretty good. The filling is tasty & the flavours get absorbed into the sticky rice. The texture of the rice is good.*** Fried Taro root dumpling is flaky and puffy on the outside, and soft on the inside. This was okay but not as flavourful or crispy as I'd like*** Salt Water Dumpling is solid. Nothing exceptional, but tasted okay**^ Braised chicken feet taste okay. Unfortunately, the chicken feet weren't cooked as much as they should be so that the flavours would get absorbed in better. There were only 3 feet in the dish, cut into halves. The dish is mostly peanuts (on the bottom). **^ White Radish cake is so-so, with not enough radish or wok flavour. This is usually one of my favourites, but this version was not very tasty.**^ Rice noodle rolls with scallions are very soft, and lacking flavour. Most of the flavour comes from the soy & hoisin sauces that are added on top, but there was not enough sauce. It would have been better with sesame sauce.** Shrimp dumplings with chives is disappointing & not flavourful. There was hardly any shrimp. Usually, I'd want these to be full of plump, succulent shrimp *^ Stuffed pepper is bland. I wouldn't recommend.* Chestnut cake is sweet. The texture is okay, but I'm not a fan of how it tastes.

In addition to the shrimp, we got the twin lobster tails which was tastier than expected but also pretty pricey ($56 for tails) and the lamb souvlaki which was very juicy but kind of hard to eat because of how chewy it was.

We called ahead and specifically requested a high chair for our friend\\'s 7-month-old baby + a reservation for 5 adults. When we arrived, the table was set correctly (a table of 6 with 5 adult chairs + a high chair in the middle). Baby was asleep in the stroller off to the side but we knew we were going to need the high chair for when the baby would wake up. 15 minutes into our meal, the owner (Maria\\'s husband) suddenly walked over to our table in a huffy, angrily grabbed the high chair, and loudly dragged it over to an empty table, without a single word. We were too stunned to say anything but we all looked at him extremely confused. He didn\\'t make eye contact, didn\\'t say anything, didn\\'t confirm whether we still needed the chair... just walked away with it and didn\\'t look back. We thought maybe, surely, another party had called who were arriving shortly and requested a high chair and there was only one in the entire restaurant?? NOPE, the empty table remained empty for the remainder of our time at the restaurant -- probably another hour. The baby woke up and we were forced to hold him on our lap in the meantime. Luckily, our friends had brought a mini portable booster seat just in case. The owner continued to make dirty looks at us for the remainder of the meal.I asked the wait staff why our high chair was taken away from us. They were gracious and tried to be helpful but could not provide an answer as to why the owner had taken the high chair away like that. They looked extremely uncomfortable and could not explain. I am still incredulous and do not understand why the owner targeted us that way. Perhaps it was because we were a fully Chinese table and the owner just didn\\'t like us??... Truly cannot think of a reason to take away a high-chair from a 7-month-old baby, without a single word or question to confirm whether we still needed it, especially since we specifically requested it. Let that speak for itself and be wary.Beyond that, the \"Maria\\'s oysters\" were filled with 95% spinach and cream sauce and had barely 1/6 of an oyster in them. Of the 6 oysters that come in an order, I would guess they cut an oyster into six pieces. The breading on the fried calamari was unappetizing. The red snapper and branzino were dry and flavorless.

The bilao platters are the filipino version of a po pu platter. \\xa0There are 4 options to choose from and this will feed about 4-10 people, depending on the option you choose.There are some great dishes worth trying here. \\xa0One of my favorites is the sisig. \\xa0Delicious! \\xa0The meat has just the right amount of fattiness and crispiness. \\xa0The dish comes sizzling to your table and is so freaking good. \\xa0Another great dish is the lumpiang frito or fried spring rolls filled with shrimp, pork and veggies. \\xa0It comes with a garlic vinegar dipping sauce that is perfectly matched. They offer weekday and weekend specials for around $9 which includes your choice of two dishes (from a list entrees), along with rice, soup and soda, coffee or tea.Save some room as they also offer a lot of options for hot and cold drinks, smoothies and desserts. \\xa0There are some unusual options being offered here like the frozen yema shake or the leche con hielo drink.

I used to always call beforehand, order the same thing and show up 15 minutes later eat and then go. I have never missed an advance order and always show up a few minutes after I have placed the order. This has been for the past 5+ years. It is not like they don\\'t know me.

Now this time I am so busy I just needed a quick bite, she flat out refuses to take my order, saying the restaurant is full and all excuses. When I came the restaurant has 2-3 vacant seating, there was business, but not full blown busy. It is okay if it was really busy, but she was flat out refusing to advance order even though at times the restaurant was a ghost town. If it was a \"To Go\" order its okay, she will take the advance phone order, for you to pick up. But if it was a phone order for a dine-in, she flat out refuses.. for a regular... of 5+ years... I will make sure all my work place, my peers and the internet know about your horrible service and garbage treatment of regulars.

Also, their chairs are very roomy.Service was good, easy to flag down servers but they definitely didn't come and ask you how you are (which is standard for a Chinese restaurant and I love it - they're there when you need them but don't bother you otherwise). Servers speak Mandarin and English (probably also Canto, but I don't speak Canto). The food was amazing. We got a fish soup that was perfect, but the fish was bonier than expected. The cold liver dish was AMAZING. Already dreaming about it again. And we got one non-spicy dish with chicken and mu er mushrooms.

I had such a fantastic time that I've gone back 5 times since. It is conveniently located on Vernon Blvd, right up the block from the 7 train. If you're just walking down the street it is easy to mixx because doesn't look like much from the outside but once you walk in theres a decent sized bar with some dining tables, a juke box and then a fabulous backyard area to dine outside. I almost always get a table outside when I come because it's such a cute patio area that you wouldn't otherwise know exists!The prices are great for the area, easily the cheapest bottomless brunch option I've found in NYC. It is $12 for an entree and $12 to add on unlimited mimosas and sangria. The waitstaff is always fairly friendly, I've had a few times where they've struggled to keep up with the patio area but I'll point the finger at understaffing. They also have a great happy hour on the weekdays from 4-8pm offering $5 drinks. Food is so good too. The omelette comes generously filled with the add-ons of your choice, the hamburger benedict is definitely a different twist on the traditional benedict but so generously portioned and the arugula salad with grilled chicken is a great diet friendly alternative! All in all, this is a great spot in LIC for brunch, happy hour, drinks with friends or a casual dinner.\",\n",

We go there to celebrate milestones, birthdays, team achievements and sometimes just to decompress after a long day. We often take visitors with us to Dominie's Hoek, because we have loved our local bar for a long time. We are proud to show others the laid back, unique and NYC-vibe that encompasses Dominie's Hoek. All of this changed when we recently went to Dominie's Hoek - a group of about 8 of us. We had our usual couple of drinks, nachos and some other finger foods. When we were ready to leave, we got the bill and paid in cash. I personally cross referenced, counted and re-counted a few times. We left. One of our colleagues stayed behind to use the bathroom. When she was leaving the bathroom, the server accused us of underpaying. If we did this - it was an honest mistake, and we would be glad to take ownership of that - we would never purposely short the bill or the servers at Dominie's - it's our local spot and we go there literally all the time. We always pay and always tip. Moving on, our colleague immediately offered to give the extra cash to make sure we were all settled up. No problem but it gets worse. The server asked her if we were from another country because we didn't know how to pay. When I heard about this, I was livid and sad all at the same time. This racist action is heartbreaking and it's shocking that it occurred in NYC, where many are in fact from another country. We won't be going back or recommending it to anyone - ever.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Hands down my favorite Greek restaurant in Astoria. Each dish has it's unique flavor profile and it's what sets this restaurant apart from the rest (even that super popular one off of Ditmars Blvd).We went there for a total of three times. This review is for the first two weekday dinners, the last one deserves it's own review...So let's start! What did we order for appetizers? Calamari: lightly battered and fried with capers tarter sauce. Soft and tender with a nice snap/crunch! It was delicious on its own or with the sauce!Htapodi: grilled octopus with black eyed peas, the fire roasted red peppers gave it a slight sweetness and the capers gives it a nice salty combination. Cherry shrimp tempura: this was one of our favorite dishes. A perfect balance of batter and fresh shrimp. The spicy aioli had a nice kick and the combination of flavors melt together perfectly. Pikilia: this was one amazing spread with pita bread and defines what this restaurant is about, deliciously bold. Try this first and experience what this place has to offer. Savor each spread and experience how different they are from one another. Octopus balls: so including this, we have 3 fried dishes. For most part, fried food starts to taste the same but not so here! And this was one of the many reasons why we love this place! They have very specific flavors associated with each dish and not one of them taste like another! There are no single secret sauce that they put on everything, every dish stands on its own! \\xa0With that being said let's talk about their entrees...First time we ordered...Seafood moussaka: if you love seafood, if you love Mac and cheese and if you still want to get your veggies in, this is the go to dish and my absolute favorite! It's like lobster Mac and cheese but 100xs more sophisticated with a hint of sweetness from all the fresh seafood and veggies layered into it! Elliniko bifteki: can you believe we ordered a burger from here? But what a burger!! By this time we were so full from all the other dishes that we only took a bite and had the rest to go. Our tall and super nice waiter was concerned that we didn't touch our food, but rest assure we just couldn't take another bite. So what's so amazing about this burger? First, took it home and kept it in the fridge for a day, heated up the oven and threw this huge burger for 15 minutes, it came out juicy and the smoked cheese and sauce was just as good as day one! So we went back a week later and tried some more, including the appetizers listed about. Now let's talk about their fish and sides...Second time we got bronzino and the roasted potatoes. Remember up top I mentioned better than that other place off of Ditmars? There's a reason for that, went to that other location 3 times just so I can convince myself they're good and failed each time. Ditmars Greek place is literally boiled potatoes with a splash of lemon juice! But here, they roast the potatoes wedges until there is a nice crunchy outer layer and the lemon flavor is cooked all the way through, suggested and paired perfectly with out bronzino. Thanks this time to our waitress! Last.. dessert, get the chef's special... nuff said, it's delicious! Following up with our third visit in another review. Here's a preview: I understand why some people were not happy here... two great servers.

There is a lot to appreciate at this no-nonsense joint and despite some highs and lows, Kababish is definitely worth checking out, especially for those with a curious palate. Like many spots in the neighborhood, this place would have the word \"dive\" written all over it. Approach the counter where a myriad of curries and stews, various meat appetizers await. Someone from the kitchen will take your order as you peruse their overhead menu of various classics and specials. The setup is more take out friendly than sit down, but casual meals aside, it\\'s really all about preference here. I\\'ll start with the things that I didn\\'t like that much:* Their delivery packaging is suspect. Sometimes the plastic is wrapped so hard that it ends up being in the food.* I won\\'t lie, I am not feeling a lot of their curries: chicken tikka masla is not strength, clearly. I would also throw their the gola beef kabab in the bunch.* Service is efficient, but it\\'s also not great either. First timers might find this somewhat off-putting, especially to newbies to the cuisine.* Don\\'t ask to use the restroom. Hold it.To the things I really enjoy:* Their seekh kebab is some of the best I\\'ve had.* Brains. Offal. Organ meats. You can have it all here. (See \"Tawa Kata-Kat\" on their specialty menu)* Big ups to the biryani here.

The $10 steak ended up being $16 per person even though we met the $10 minimum spending requirement per person. I asked what the sides are with the steak. They said you can choose either mashed potatoes or vegetables. So I chose vegetables. When the bill came, they added $3 for a side of vegetables, per person. Then they added $2.00 up-charge because the $20 in other purchases were appetizers. So, a $10 steak night turned into a $60 bill for two. And the waiter acknowledged this was a crappy thing to do.

We thought they brought out a scallion pancake instead and had to confirm with the waiter. The ox bone soup was good but it has very little noodles and beef pieces. The beef short rib stew is overly sweet and is way too pricy for the amount of ribs they give. Overall they're too cheap with their ingredients and not worth the price you pay.

Will likely try this next time. The staff was friendly, but seemed a bit lazy. Took a while for them to realize that they seated us without menus. There was only 1 other group in the restaurant too so it was a little surprising. They did apologize for their mistake though.\",\n",

But, came here yesterday for some football (only one TV showing the Jets btw) and was totally thrown off by the rude bartender and then the dramatic situation which ensued. First off, I want to make it clear that the way the bartender (tall male) spoke to us was entirely unacceptable regardless of circumstance. Dude - you are in the service industry and it\\'s part of your job to accommodate your patrons - get it together!!!! The rudeness and language used to address us was insane, especially considering it was 12PM in the afternoon (it\\'s not like we were a bunch of sloppy drunks at 2AM). I\\'ve never heard a bartender or waiter speak to a customer like that in my life! Plus, talking down to women? Not okay. I arrived with my bf and three friends (two guys and one 8 month pregnant friend)... there were only four chairs at our table, so I pulled one up from the bar. The bartender came over almost immediately saying \"someone is bringing over other chairs for you to use. These chairs are for people at the bar\"... of course I immediately said \"sorry!\", but upon further inspection, I see that the chairs at our table (about 24 inches from the bar) are the exact same chair, plus there were five empty chairs at the bar where I was taking ONE chair from... if someone was coming to replace the chair, then why couldn\\'t they just put that replacement chair at the bar? I don\\'t get it. Also, I wanted a seat NOW, not in five minutes when this replacement chair arrived (hey, I was tired!). Then, the bartender starts YELLING at my pregnant friends husband (unbeknownst to me, five minutes before my arrival, my guy friend and the bartender had the SAME EXACT interaction.... why can\\'t we just take this chair and replace the one at the bar?)... I don\\'t know why this bartender just went off for NO REASON!! All I did was pull over a freaking chair to sit in! We\\'re customers! Not to mention, my friend is pregnant... have some tact and respect. So obviously, as a group, we decide to leave (sorry Blackbird\\'s... after 9 years of loyal patronship from a group of 20 frat bros and their wives, we\\'re officially saying: it\\'s you, not us)... then, unfortunately, my friends husbands went to push the chair, in an attempt to be dramatic, and it tipped over and fell on the floor!! Of course this was the worst possible thing that could have happened... needless to say, testosterone was now flowingggggg. Sucks that thus unreasonable situation happened and set him off. Next thing I know, another employee starts yelling at my friend, then a man in a hat w greyish longer hair and another employee run outside behind us, they\\'re all yelling at us, chasing us down the street.... we were leaving!!! Your staff was rude to us the second we walked in that day - we didn\\'t want to stay, and knocking over the chair was clearly and accident! Get it together!!! It was just such an unfortunate situation, that didn\\'t even need to happen... all due to a bartender not wanting to share an unused chair with a patron. Sick.'},\n",

       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Average Shanghainese food, but they curiously market themselves in the broader category of Chinese cuisine on their windows. I'm guessing it's to attract a wider audience and to get those in here that are not familiar with just Shanghainese food, but either way, there's plenty of improvements that can be made.Recently, I came here for an early dinner on a Saturday evening at 6pm and the restaurant surprisingly already had plenty of customers inside. The menu was pretty big for a Shanghainese restaurant, or at least compared to other Shanghainese restaurants that we've been to. There were the usual cold appetizers, regular appetizers, soup dumplings and meat dishes (pork, beef, chicken and seafood). In addition, there were also vegetables, casserole specials, fried rice, noodles, rice cakes and much more. Like I said, the menu was something I could have sat there reading for an hour. However, we sort of just ordered our usual Shanghainese favorites.To keep it simple we ordered a few appetizers, a carb and a bigger casserole type dish. We started off with the spungy gluten (aka Kao Fu) and drunken chicken. The spungy gluten, as disgusting as that always sounds, wasn't bad. Compared to other Shanghainese restaurants it was decent. Good flavor, good texture and good serving size. As for the drunken chicken, freaking delicious. It was one of the best drunken chicken dishes I had in a while. At first, we thought the wine on the chicken was going to be very strong because the aroma really kicked in quick when the dish was set on our table. However, the strength of the wine on the chicken was jusssst right. Although it smelled strong, in actuality, it wasn't when eating the chicken and the chicken was perfectly flavored. For our non-appetizers, we ordered the Bund crab meat pork soup dumplings, pan fried pork buns, Shanghainese sautéed seafood udon noodles and flounder fillet with tofu casserole to share. The soup dumplings were on the sweet side, so we weren't huge fans of it. Texture-wise, I liked the thickness of the skin, the soup was hot and I thought the pork meatball was put together well, but there was a sweetness to the soup that we weren't used to. It definitely needed to be saltier. The pan fried pork buns weren't the greatest in that it was very dry inside where the meatball resided. I would have preferred more sauce inside that could have made the bun more moist.The udon noodles were average and nothing that we were overly impressed about. To be honest, there's not much that can be done for this dish, but when it says seafood, I would expect seafood, which it was overly lacking.Finally, the flounder fillet with tuna lacked flavor. It was sizzling in a clay pot when it came out, which was music to our ears, but there wasn't a whole lot to it. The sauce was bland, which made everything in there taste the same.The service was good throughout and the waiters/waitresses were friendly, so I hate to say the following. The Bund makes for an average local spot, but compared to the restaurants in Flushing, it has a lot of work to do to catch up. The food is by no means terrible, but some of the food can use better flavors and a bit more salt, which is something I typically don't say, but it's definitely something that needs to be mentioned here. For now, they're on the low end of 3 stars.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"We were drawn to The Bund Chinese Cuisine by a recent New York Times article about the surge of quality Chinese restaurants in Forest Hills, NY. Food: OK (3 of 5). The Bund was a decent experience. We had:- Bund Pork Soup Dumplings (福園小籠包)- Crab Meat Pork Soup Dumplings (蟹粉小籠包)- Pan Fried Pork Buns (福園生煎包)- Chicken with Eggplant (茄子雞)We thought the soup dumplings were good, but not great. The soup dumplings here use a regular (thicker) dumpling skin that render the dumplings less susceptible to breakage. The filling in the pork soup dumplings and pan fried pork buns are similar -- flavorful and juicy, but it seemed to have an extra sharpness or tingle that wore out its welcome after a few helpings. This could be MSG, but I'm not sure. The crab meat pork soup dumplings were similar to the pork soup dumplings, but with the addition of some crab meat. The crab meat flavor was less noticeable here than at other establishments.The Chicken with Eggplant was well-executed and very flavorful. It comes with a bowl of white or brown rice; you may need more because the dish is heavily-sauced.Service: Good (3 of 5).Value: OK (3 of 5). The restaurant makes its pork soup dumplings complimentary if your order is $35 or more and paid in cash, for orders after 3 PM and all day Saturdays and Sundays. The minimum purchase required for free pork soup dumplings is $25 paid in cash weekdays from 11:30 AM to 3 PM. Suggested tips are based on pre-tax subtotals.Atmosphere: Good (3 of 5).

Honestly, the presentation is better than the taste. The eggs benedict with smoked salmon on a waffle were not that good. The whole wheat waffles are healthier than regular waffles but I still expected it to be crispy outside and moist inside - instead, it had a grainy texture, dry inside, and soft outside. The smoked salmon was a little too salty which overpowered the hollandaise sauce on the eggs benedict :(Butttt the green tea latte was exactly what I was craving since I was pretty cold that morning so that was really nice. They ran out of peppermint so my mom ordered a regular latte w/ skim - thought it had too much coffee and not enough milk making it too strong for her liking.We def wanted to try the taiyaki as well but after waiting on line, the cashier told the customer in front of me that they didn't have any more (we went \\xa0Saturday 11:30 am) - anyways by the time we left, the place was paaacked so maybe their other foods r better\",\n",

We paid 10.75 for the guac...which in my opinion is a little pricey, especially when you get stale-ish chips and not a whole lot of guac. Definitely not enough for more than 2 ppl.

His favorite and came highly recommended as the best taco by our waitress. (I deferred I can't do pineapple with foods) We both tried the pulled chicken and that was delicious. Good flavor. For the carne Asada and carnitas- very good nut NEEDS the salsas they have for more flavor. Ask and they will bring you three different salsas. Each taco was 3.50.

The sushi was actually the star of the meal, with the steak tartare as a close second (though not sure the portion was worth the steep $34 price tag).

       "  'Positive Review 3': \"Before the bubble tea craze spreaded all over the borough, Tea and Milk was practically the only boba game in Astoria. And still today, they remain one of the only sucessful non-chain bubble tea businesses in NYC, all while having developed serious fanfare amongst the local community. The shop is as small as many other cafes / bubble tea places. There is one large communal table inside with limited seating as well as an outdoor bench. Most of the staff is of college age and is super nice. Perhaps one of these days, they'll take over an old bakery and revamp the space so it can become a destination spot with WiFi and the works.But of course, the real draw is the drinks. At various sizes they do a good job with the branding and offer a good variety of flavors that extend beyond the basic stuff that some boba shops might showcase. It's important to note they don't use powder when making their drinks. Sure, the prices aren't entirely budget friendly, however, their high quality product proves its value quickly.My boba jam is their hibiscus flower peach and their taro milk. Both are refreshing and mildly sweet and I prefer no boba in either of them. The roasted oolong is also worth a look, as is the signature grandma masala chai. There are new flavors constantly being added to the menu as well as seasonal ones that shouldn't be missed.They also deliver at this point, which is pretty awesome. I am hoping they stick around for a long time seeing as non-corporate boba is such a rare thing. To the team at T&M: keep doing what you're doing, we'll be drinking.\",\n",

Just wow. I was really blown away by how good the food here was. For reference I had spicy beef tongue and beef dumplings. The dumplings were very flavorful on their own, but I opted to add some of the chili sauce that was on the tables.

Some of the best dumplings I've had to be sure. The beef tongue though, oh it was good. This was really where the dish was fantastic. I would say the best comparison I can thing of would be to Sichuan mala pig ear. It was absolutely amazing, and with just a great texture that I hadn't had before with beef tongue. The service here was great and very attentive, and they had a good list of beers available.

The raita definitely helps neutralize the spiciness. The chicken chop is spicier. I am glad we got the raita. Both dishes were delicious and came with plenty of chicken. The kheer was also very good, creamy but not heavy nor overly sweet. I could taste the condensed milk. It's the best kheer I had so far.\",\n",

They are famous for their hamburger and the perfect Guinness pour, which is why I think my dad started going here in the first place, many years ago. I love their wings, which I think they run a special for on Wednesday's. They are always made crispy and come out piping hot.Overall, Donovan's has become an institution in Woodside.

Also, you cannot order bottomless drinks unless you pay for brunch.We were not allowed to change our bottomless drink selection so if you ordered mimosas you cant change it to blood marys at any point. We were only able to order bottomless drinks for 90 minutes but the waitress was never at our table! We spent most of the time waiting for her to bring us drinks than we did drinking! On top of that the drinks were watered down with barely any alcohol. So not worth the price. The brunch buffet was mediocre at best. the food was stale and looked sickly. I dont know how anyone can mess up bacon but this place did. There wasn't much food variety either for the price. The potatoes and meat tasted rancid. The only good thing about the brunch buffet is the guy making made-to-order omelettes. While he was working very hard to fulfill our orders, we were waiting up to 20 min at the omelette station just to get freaking omelettes because there was only one guy working there. The place is old, greasy, dark and has a bunch of fireplaces that are poorly placed. It looks dirty and haunted. The best looking thing about that place is probably the bathroom. The waitress was rude and sour. The place was obviously understaffed bc she never got around to our table. She sighed or said something under her breath every time we asked for our drinks and made the effort to attend to every table except ours. Her attitude was definitely not welcoming. And for the icing on the cake they included a 60% gratuity tip on our bill! After giving us disgusting food and mediocre service. The only person that deserved any tip was the guy making omelettes.

I looked up reviews to see if things have changed and came across a few mixed reviews on FB about the service and the food. After reading mostly bad reviews, I decided to take the plunge and decided for myself.

Food/Drinks: Since this is a beer garden you can imagine the extensive beer list available. It was pretty impressive. I went with a yummy blood orange cider. The chicken flat bread and the calamari appetizer. All were very good. I wish the cheese on the flat bread melted a teeny bit more but it wasn't bad. The calamari was at a perfect crisp level. Our friend ordered the cutlet and man this thing was HUGE. If you decide to order it plan on sharing with a mate. Once I was done with my beer I moved on to trying an old fashion. Man-o-man!

It is a great take on this iconic dish and will leave you satisfied as you taste through the chicken with sauce and tortilla.

We waited nearly 10 minutes for our waitress to come to check on us so that we could request the plates, the forgotten jalapeño, and a second round of water - as we had never gotten a refill since we entered the restaurant. After another 5 minutes passed we could not wait any longer and had to go to the bartender just to get plates and our jalapeño. We never got a refill on water and were never checked up on.

There were a guy in the front which looked like he was the owner. If you're tired go home don't be outside standing with angry faces in front. He looked angry, he looked tired.

However, this time, we were very disappointed with the food. Everything was almost cold when it arrived. The noodles from the Drunken noodle was all stuck together, there was barely any chicken in there, and the ones we did get, had tiny bone fragments. The calamari was dried up, and looked disgusting.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Karczma, where do I begin? Everything in this place is sooo good. When you walk in, you'll see that this place looks very traditionally adorned. There is a full bar to your left, and there are wooden tables throughout the restaurant. The restaurant is a decent size, and has plenty of booth- seating. They have a few tables that are in the middle of the booths, but it doesn't seem like they can accommodate a large party. The menu has very traditional Polish dishes. They have a platter of Polish specialties which I love ordering because it has a mix of some of their popular appetizers: hunter's stew, potato pancakes, stuffed cabbage, kielbasa, and pierogis. They have several different kinds of pierogis (cheese, sauerkraut) but the meat one is my favorite. I recommend getting them fried. The plate of Polish specialties is generous portion, sufficient enough to be an entree for 1 person, or shared appetizer for 2-3 people. For the soup, I recommend the white borscht soup - ask for it to be served in a bread bowl. For the entrees, we ordered a special of the day - the rabbit stew with potato dumplings and a beet salad, and also the spicy beef goulash, which was served on top of potato pancakes. Our favorite part of the meal was the appetizers. We thought the sauce for the rabbit wasn't that flavorful, but the beet salad that it came with was just soooo good and addicting. It was a nice balance of sweet and freshness to cut the heaviness of the meals. My spicy beef goulash was a nice hearty portion, but I was a little disappointed that it wasn't spicy at all (it was good nevertheless).For dessert, we ordered apple pie. Let me tell you, this apple pie was one of the best ones I've ever had, even though they didn't have ice cream here. It had copious amounts of sliced apples, and the crust portion of the pie was dense and cake-like. The pie was drizzled in chocolate sauce, and served with dollops of whipped cream. It wasn't too sweet nor too heavy, but the portion is quite large and is more than enough to share amongst two people. I love coming back here because of how great the food is, but the prices make it even more appealing to come back. Two large beers, one appetizer, two entrees, a dessert, and a dessert cocktail (plus tip) was less than $100, plus we had leftovers to bring home!\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"I came with my mom on a holiday weekend evening, and we got the last table. We were asked to switch to a smaller table while we were looking at the menu, which we happily obliged because the table we were at was huge for two.Anyway, we decided to share the Polish platter, which came with 1 sauerkraut & mushroom / 1 meat / 1 potato & cheese pierogi, a piece of Kielbasa sausage, one stuffed cabbage with tomato sauce, 2 potato pancakes, hunter stew, and a container of sour cream. To preface my review, the first time I had Polish food was in Poland, so my standards may be a bit high. The food here was pretty good with regards to other Polish food I've had in the US, but of course not as good as in Poland. The pierogi skin was chewy and not too thick, which is rare to find in the US. The meat one had too much meat and it was basically just eating a chunk of meat without any other flavor, and the sauerkraut & mushroom was sticky, which I've never experienced before at any Polish restaurant. I didn't like the stickiness at all. My favorite pierogi was the potato and cheese one because it was flavorful and light. The Kielbasa sausage was quite tasty as well, even though the piece was small. I usually love goblaki, which is the stuffed cabbage, but this one just had way too much meat and too little rice; the balance was off, and there was too little sauce. The potato pancakes were thick and had a great thickness and consistency, but it didn't have much flavor. The hunter stew was really sour and I didn't enjoy it, but I didn't like hunter stew in Poland either so it may not be this particular restaurant's hunter stew that I don't like.It was a lot of food, and service was present. I would say I might return for the cheese and potato pierogi and maybe potato pancakes if they serve it with some flavorful sauce, but I wouldn't return for anything else we had on that plate.Price was quite fair for the amount of food as it came out to be around $16 post-tax.\",\n",

At that point two hours had passed and we were running late for our next engagement, so we settled the bill and left. \\xa0I thought what we paid was higher than expected, but we had no time to wait forever to flag him down again, so I figured we could resolve it tomorrow as he mentioned.This is when it goes downhill. \\xa0Once I got home, I realized we were indeed charged $20 more than we should have been. \\xa0Unfortunately, I didn't save the itemized bill, so couldn't figure out what went wrong. \\xa0Either he charged my 3rd friend for unlimited (but couldn't be, since we specifically checked that) or he added an automatic gratuity to our bill (which we tipped 20% on top of).The next day and the day after, I try calling Mojave as the waiter asked us to do, but nobody answered the phone and there was no voicemail. Finally, Wednesday since I'm somewhat near the area, I stop by myself to sort it out. \\xa0I speak with Denis, the manager, who helps me calculate what the total should have been and it matches what I thought. \\xa0He asked me to describe the waiter, which I did, and tells me that he was new and maybe he added the auto gratuity to the bill. \\xa0He tries to resolve it at the cashier machine using the copy of my receipt, but comes back to tell me the receipts have already been sent to the credit card company and since I don't have the itemized bill or my friends' receipts, he'll need a few days to get a copy of the bill to resolve it. \\xa0He even gave me his card, which I thought was promising, but it just had the same number that I had been trying before. \\xa0Thankfully there was an email address on there, so to be safe, I emailed him the copy of my receipt along with all of the details of what we ordered and how much the check was off.After that I did not hear a peep from Denis. \\xa0I sent two follow up emails until I decided to give up, as $20 is not worth this headache. \\xa0Honestly, it wasn't the money that was the issue, but more the principle of, if you're a business and you mess up, you should do what you can to resolve it or make the customer happy. \\xa0If getting the receipt was that difficult, a coupon for a free drink or something of the sort would have at least left me with a more positive perception of the restaurant. \\xa0But what I saw was little to no effort to resolve the issue, leaving behind a very unhappy customer. \\xa0Will not be back.\",\n",

Cronin & Phelan\\'s is among several pubs that is making Astoria look really good as a destination for all things Irish, but are they best in the hood? More than likely, yes.The bar is modest but the selection is vast. They have a number of solid beers on tap and a pretty good selection of spirits to boot. The bartenders are all lovely people and coupled with the TVs with sports and the occasional live music, it\\'s hard not to have a good time here. Their usual cast of characters (i.e. the regulars!) can make for good conversation and if one is really good, they might get a drink out of it.Where they really shine is their food. Sure the allure of Irish whiskey and beers are laden at the bar but the quality of their edible offerings far surpass the average pub fare. The shepherd\\'s pie is quite tasty, as is their bangers and mash. I\\'ve never been a huge fan of Irish breakfast platters, but their blood pudding is worthy of every bite.Then they have a number of other items, ranging from bar food to Italian classics like a veal marsala and fried ravioli. The burgers are halfway decent, even French onion soup deserves a mention. Every time I eat their loaded potato skins, I question my judgement because I can eat a lot more than the 3 that come in one order.Also, what kind of an Irish pub offers dessert like apple pie a la mode, strawberry rhubarb pie, or a triple chocolate mousse cake? Cronin & Phelan\\'s does. In addition, they have multiple flavors of ice cream and \"Mexican\" platter of sweet plantains, churros, and more ice cream.This place is a kind of venue worth visiting for just about any occasion.

NY Food Court is very similar to New World Mall food court, but just smaller. Although it's smaller, there are still enough food stalls to satisfy your cravings. You can still find bubble tea,desserts, skewers, dumplings, noodles, ramen, and etc here. This food court became my go-to food court because 1. it's less crowded and 2. I finally found the Taiwanese sizzling steak that used to be in the Flushing Mall. They are known for their sizzling black pepper Taiwanese Steak, which I highly recommend it! It comes with noodles (so yummy!), a side of salad, and sweet tea. Heads up if you order from here they will charge you a $5 deposit for the sizzling hot plates (they will give it back to you when you return your plates).\",\n",

I'd actually walked by this place many times and did not think anything of it. From the outside, you cannot tell how big this Asian food court is. There are at least 15 different stalls to choose from. It is not as big as the food court inside the nearby New World Mall, but it still has a similar selection and is less crowded too. Almost all of the stalls are various Chinese cuisines (Cantonese, Taiwanese, Szechuan, Shanghainese, etc.) with some Japanese, and Korean too. Yes, it is lacking in pan-Asian variety but does offer many different things (noodles, bubble tea, BBQ, rice platters, seafood). Prices are reasonably low at all the stalls too.\",\n",

Today my girl friend got the green pepper with beef after waiting for 15minutes.However, what we found was that the beef was in low warm and the pepper was like baterry size thick and one side cold which means it was leftovers. When I asked the cashiers, the ladies in front just said their food were all fresh without checking. But a Male worker there who must know the truth got the food back and promised me for a new one. After another 15minutes, we ended up getting a salty, stiff and burnt Green pepper with beef!!! We just threw it away. What a bad day we had. I have never left any comment but I just couldn't keep silent this time. I just wanna tell the fact! By the way, their boiled fish with chili is also quite terrible. Will never visit here.\",\n",

I love the fast casual concept here. Patrons can order their food in the front and grab a seat wherever, no tipping required. All their pastas are also made fresh in-house. On my visit with my friend, we ordered the pappardelle bolognese, the tagliatelle scampi, the forma salad, and the arancini (yes we can eat). I absolutely loved both the presentation and taste of both pasta dishes. The pappardelle was simply executed with a bold and flavorful meat marinara sauce. The tagliatelle included sautéed shrimp, white wine, and a lemon butter sauce that brought all the flavors together perfectly. The forma salad was a nice lighter dish to pair with our pastas. I liked the arancini but in comparing it to my other arancini experience from Arancini Bros at Smorgasburg, this does not compare, though it was still tasty.

The spaghetti pomodoro, reminded me of a slightly tastier version of chef boyardee's sauce, because it had that same level of sweetness, but had more of a flavor depth to it that I can't quite explain. The meatballs are surprisingly, freaking small, but bigger then the chef boyardee version. Personally, I wasn't fond of this dish.Side of cauliflower that had tasty sauce, HOWEVER, and this is a huge no no and costed stars from me due to unhygienic food handling: The person who took care of the garnishing, plated the cooked cauliflower with his bare hands, that's right, SANS gloves, and placed the garnishes on top, then served directly to me.

Is this boost in quality worth the higher price though? Not exactly.Food: The dishes seem to have a mix of Japanese and Korean influence. Personally, I feel that the quality/wow factor of the hot foods have declined over the years and isn't anything impressive. It's mostly just fried foods.The cold foods/salads look and taste fresh (that's a plus) and some of the salads are fun to the palate! Like salmon egg salad, mango jicama, etc.They do have a vast arrangement of different kinds of sushi and rolls, which is better than only having your average California Roll like some other buffets do. They have sashimi, tataki, live clams, cocktail shrimp, mini poke bowls, etc...all a delight to have! This is where the price best goes to at Mizumi! (During dinner hours, they also provide crab legs.)The soups and dessert are nice; no complaints but no praise.Decor: The tables are not cramped and there are walls dividing up diners in sections. There's music playing in the background. The bathroom is pretty clean.Service: Waiters/waitresses are okay. Things get done.

The soups are very salty. They did not appeal to me one bit. I did tried the crab soup. There are no crab meat in there so its a false advertisement. There are a lot of carbs if you like. The fishes are either over salted, dry or overcooked.The meat are too overcooked especially the beef. Which was the only palatable beef there in the buffet. There are some varieties of sushi. They are all stuffed with a lot of rice. Otherwise would be decent. There are raw clams. Not fresh and I would not recommend. The dessert section is small and they played it very safe. Each piece are tiny bite size. Overly sweet, spongy and nothing indifferent.They do not have ice cream but instead some gelato.

Finally we're able to flag down the coffee barista who tells us it will be a fifteen minute wait.

She finally arrives and tells us she is so sorry, they must be the only place open (New Year's Day). No, it's just a heavy brunch day- we thought this was common knowledge, but apparently this restaurant didn't know. Ah, the slowness starts to make sense. She takes our order: Coffees, Chorizo Baked Eggs, Cheddar Grits, Tortilla Soup, and a CUP of the Buffalo Chicken Mac and Cheese. A bit all over the place, but it was our first time and we wanted to try things!45 minutes later, burnt/too strong coffee, no food, and no one has checked in. I asked for more water at one point and she forgot about it.Food arrives: The Buffalo Mac and Cheese has unseasoned fried chicken on top, but looked bigger than cup size- exciting we thought...until we tried it. Bland chicken, a weird tobasco flavored cheese sauce and undercooked pasta. The Chorizo eggs were so over done, they seemed to have a plastic film over them- inedible and the whole dish tasted like canned tomatoes. The Tortilla Soup didn't seem to have any flavor- did they use plain water as the broth? And the grits were soupy and had no seasoning whatsoever. Inedible.We didn't eat much of anything and we flagged the waitress down for the check because we just wanted to get out of there. She asked if we wanted boxes and when we said no, she was shocked. We told her we did not like anything and she kept saying that people normally love the food. How?! She was very sweet and comped the Chorizo Eggs.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"I'm kind of shocked that I never wrote a review for Iki, I've been here many times over the years since they've opened. TLDR: Modernistic Japanese cuisine. Tasty but pricey. Good place for an expense kind of dinner if you're in the area or... if you just got it going on like that.I started eating here late nights for sushi/sashimi. I've done their tasting menu once and I will say - it's very lux type of dining. It is a lot of food. The tasting menu was $95 when I went. Their cooked dishes are more of their strong point IMO.Noteworthy recommendations though are the Scallop with Foie Gras and Maitake Mushroom. I actually crave this quite often, it's an expensive appetizer for $12 but the execution is flawless. The Uni Foie Gras Toast, that's around $20 if I remember. The Spicy Lobster, circling around $35~ or so. It is damn good though.The sushi and sashimi is decent, probably better quality for the area but if you don't mind the travel - I think there are better options to be found in Manhattan or further East in Queens.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': 'I was going to give this restaurant a 5 star review since I\\'ve been to this place multiple times, but due to last night\\'s experience, I knocked down one star. I\\'ll start with the good stuff first. This is a pricey restaurant, so be ready to splurge yourself. First of all, their sushi is very fresh compared to your typical Flushing sushi. However, you can also get great sushi with quality like this or even better in Manhattan for about the same price. I really enjoy their lunch specials although they are priced than your average lunch special at about $22 for sashimi lunch special. However, this is considered a bargain in comparison to their regular price menu. I must agree with many other reviewers that their toro sashimi isn\\'t the best. It\\'s not the worst either, but I felt that it was very average compared to what you would expect from toro sashimi. However, their salmon and their raw shrimp have always been great. Uni foie gras on toast - very good ! It tastes creamy and melt in your mouth from the uni. You need to eat it in one bite though or else it\\'s going to get messy and you won\\'t get all the flavors together. Don\\'t worry - it\\'s a small piece of toast - you can do it. Caviar Uni lobster - what a winner here. I\\'m a huge fan of uni so whenever there\\'s uni, I\\'m there. The raw lobster tastes very similar to raw shrimp tbh with a slight difference. Either way, it complimented each other very well.Now, let\\'s talk about the bad experience last night. First of all, do not order their omakase that\\'s priced at $110 or $130 per person (2 different menus). There were things that we wanted from both menus so it was hard to decide which to go with but we went with the $110 one. All their portion sizes are much smaller than your regular portion size when you order a la carte. I know this because I\\'ve been here several times and have ordered the same exact dishes as what\\'s on the omakase menu. The wagyu beef on the omakase menu was SO thinly sliced that it was almost non-existent. AND they forgot to give us the 3 different salt condiments on the side to pair with. We were wondering why it tasted so bland, but I remembered later when I got home that I had the same dish a few days ago and they served that salt on the side which we didn\\'t get last night! That caviar uni lobster that I\\'ve talked about before was literally half the portion size of a regular one. With that being said.... I suggest you to just order from their regular menu especially if you know exactly what you want. To me, the omakase menu was not worth it. It\\'s not that cheap and you don\\'t even get the same quantity/quality as if you\\'re ordering regular dishes. The part that got me really upset last night (and this is also due to my own newbie naive nature when it comes to ordering seafood) is that we asked the waitress what\\'s the MP for Dungeness Crab. She said $30 something per pound. We thought okay $30 is fine let\\'s do it! Bill comes: it\\'s $58. We were shocked and then when we questioned about it, they said of course it can\\'t be 1 pound. Okay, that is true now that I think about it. However, I also specifically said to the waitress \"let\\'s get 1 pound of that crab.\" She did not correct me on that statement and could have told me that it\\'s going to be more than a pound. I certainly would think that they should tell you the more realistic price of the crab before you order it! I also heard from some other more experienced seafood diners that they technically should show you the crab BEFORE they cook it and tell you approximately how many pounds it will be, which they did not either. I felt like I was jipped and taken advantage of for knowing these kinds of \"common knowledge\" When I brought that to the manager\\'s attention, he did little to compensate for it. I also said to him you should tell the waitress to tell your customers the right price upfront when it comes to these things so there is no confusion. The manager did not do much about this and all he said was that if you pay cash, it would be cheaper (tax evasion). That was it. So just be AWARE of this guys - always ask approximately how many pounds of seafood they will give you and do the math in your head. This isn\\'t like Naked Crab or other seafood joints where they will give you exactly the pound of seafood you request for.Anyway, this is definitely more of an upscale japanese restaurant in flushing. However, I still think the ones in Manhattan are better. I\\'ve also heard from many people that their omakase menu has decreased in quality and value. They are also not true omakase where they have the chef present you each dish as they make them. It\\'s not the typical omakase experience you would at other japanese restaurants, so just be aware of that. Lunch specials are a great deal here since they come with many other side dishes. This place is worth checking out if you\\'re looking for some decent sushi in Flushing.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'DO NOT ORDER ANY ROLLS! It\\'s reasonably priced but not worth it. Do try everything else! Ermahgah! I was impressed how \\'Japanese\\' a Chinese-run restaurant could be, they usually add some \"Chinesque\" traits (real word?). Wagyu hot stone was most worth it! They gave us different salt options to dip into which I absolutely salivated over. Go for the bigger portion, you\\'ll be satisfied! Tako Wasa - your typical tako , it wasn\\'t anything different from what I\\'ve had but it was still very good.Uni lobster - it\\'s like eating a seafood ice cream! So goood. Toro caviar - man, that menu photo looked so plentiful but when it actually came, it was itsy bitsy. Almost comical of how different the portion size was but it was still really good. Perfect on the toast. Why do we need butter if we have toro? Uni Foie Gras - this was a very creamy/fatty appetizer. It was definitely delicious but I\\'d suggest have some bread with it as wellCold soba - this is all I came here for cause I was cravingSoba but after all the prior flavors I already consumed, having such a clean dish wasn\\'t worth it. Also, the soba soup/sauce had some oil residue, I\\'m not use to seeing that for soba so I wonder if the bowl was just dirty.... Lobster roll and scallop roll - had very thin slices of meat laid on top. Not sure if the lobster roll was stuffed with shrimp meat or lobster meat but either way, not worth it. I would steer away from the rolls. Had nothing going for them. Okra - simple dish. Nothing special. I just like okra :) Sake - the definition of Kubota Manju just sold itself so I got a bottle and I\\'d suggest it. The waiter also said it\\'s really popular in Japan. The BIGGEST annoyance throughout our whole meal were these two damn flies that kept flying around our food and us having to keep waving them away.

I've never had such a bad meal before in Astoria where you simply could not tolerate the meal at all. I ordered a mixed chicken kabab & beef / lamb shawarma platter to share with a friend. First, the delivery took nearly an hour and half (although the estimate says 30 mins). The food arrived cold and had a horrible smell. I had to throw it outside because it was reeking up my entire apartment! It smelled like bloody meat I kid you not. The chicken was dry beyond belief. I paid extra for tzatziki sauce and man, even that was bad. It was basically chobani plain yogurt with water pour on top (not even mixed, literally sitting on top all separated). Now the beef / lamb shawarma. We all think the rotating wheel of meat, all juicy with a slight char. Well, this place decided to call frozen flank slice beef a shawarma. I feel like this place has never made this before because the meat tasted old and bloody as if it was not finished thawing. I could gag thinking about it.

The chunks of lamb, chicken, and beef are tender and delicious. Drizzled with tahini and a side of pita and I\\'m all set.But there is a lot more to appreciate. Their classic chicken kebab pita sandwich is the bomb in itself. The same goes for their infamous \"shawafel\" which is chicken shawarma with falafel all stuffed into a sandwich with vegetables and tahini + hummus.

Buttery and garlicy! Even my sister across the table said \"your mashed potatoes look really dry\" Overall, I\\'m just shocked and wondering what could have happened in just a few weeks! I heard they got new management recently so idk if that\\'s what it is but it was disappointing and everyone was unhappy with the food when I wanted to take my parents out for a nice dinner and came out to be the opposite.',\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': 'It\\'s interesting to me the people bringing businesses to our neighborhood; they don\\'t understand who we are. We\\'re mostly working class couples and families and we need good food cheap (18 bucks for a hamburger? c\\'mon, srsly? or am I just writing from the past ...). Plus, the portions? I wish them well, but it\\'s not for us. We got delivery last night and this will be our last time. Bless you if you like it, bless you if you don\\'t find this on the prohibitively expensive side, bless them in their dream of bringing this food to Ditmars, but here\\'s my two cents:1/4 I can\\'t believe how QUICKLY they delivered our food, it was amazing. Well, it should be for a TWO DOLLAR DELIVERY charge. (are you kidding me?)2/4 That was THEE best \"(5 Cheese) Mac and Cheese\" we\\'ve had in years. Even thought the portion is small (eight dollars for about a half-cup) it\\'s worth every penny, it\\'s creamy with a crispy top, flavourful, bold and full bouquet of cheeses.3/4 (a) WHY would they put some sweet yucky sauce on Shredded Crispy Brussels Sprouts with bacon, it was awful (to me, \"pretty good\" to my husband) and (b) WHY does that HANDFUL of vegetables cost 8$. That price-point was offensive.4/4 I knew going in this place is pricey, but on a Summer Sale other places in the hood have at least 6 ribs in a \"rack\" for 18 bucks so at 14$ for of Smoked Local Pork Spare Ribs order, I was not surprised there were only 4 ribs, they were but c\\'mon ... it\\'s a neighborhood joint, you want me to come back frequently? 14 bucks for four ribs and a spoonful of horrible slaw is not gonna encourage me.We won\\'t be going back, we\\'ll be going out of our way to Butcher Bar at 30th Avenue or we used to go Bubba\\'s on Ditmars but the reviews lately are bad (and their sides aren\\'t really great and their chicken is awful).

Server forgot about the order and we had to remind him and he got the burger after waiting about half an hour. The burger was so dry I had to eat it with a glass of water. Not only the patty was dry, there was no truffle flavor or moisture at all in the burger. The mushrooms inside the burger were burnt to bits like black charcoal. They actually tasted burnt and bitter. My thing is, if you see you burnt the mushrooms to pure carbon, why would you still add that to a burger that's already devoid of any moisture content.Really wanted to like this place because of the outdoor seating and ambience but we won't be back.\",\n",

We had a round of drinks and the appetizers were great, try the bacon with peanut butter. We placed our order 6 people, some sides...the works. A buddy got a filet, one got Kobe, blah blah and I got a tomahawk steak. Now when you order a steak at a steak house and with such a meaty name as Uncle Jacks, you'd assume one would be impressed. Not in this case.It was delivered underwhelming in size, presentation and with lots of char. There were a few edible pieces so I gave it a go and the taste was extremely odd and sour but chalked it up to maybe the seasoning and the char mixing. After a bit a coworker asked to try a piece and knowing that I said it tastes funky, he tried and tasted the sourness in the meat. Smh...the bummer is, this happened to two of the six steaks. \\xa0The manager was cool and removed the dinners from our $730 bill and tossed us a few drinks too.

I decided to try something new off the menu and, the Shroom burger caught my eye. It's unfortunately the only vegetarian option :( The shroom burger consists of crisp fried portobello mushroom filled with munster and cheddar cheese. I ordered fries to accompany the burger, of course. When I took my first bite, I was surprised at how cheesy it was! I've grown extremely fond of mustard lately and added it to my burger and I loved it. Now that I know I won't have to permanently quit eating from Shake Shack, I'm ecstatic! I hope later on in the future Shake Shack makes vegan options, since the Shroom burger does contain cheese! I even suggested my friends to try the shroom burger as an alternative.

While In-N-Out seemed to enjoyed the most hype in the media, partly due to its operating vicinity in Western US and thus Hollywood, the New York based Shake Shack appeared to be the hottest burger joint in the Northeast. Though not an aficionado of burgers, I could readily tell the difference in quality of a Shack Burger, but not its Western rivals. \\xa0I enjoy the texture of the beef, the buttery buns, and whatever ingredients they put in its secret sauce. Even the tomato seemed fresher and the lettuce greener. Now why only 4 stars? There were only 1 line with cashier, and 4 touch-kiosks with no taker. \\xa0I decided to wait in line since there were only 2 people in front of me -- \\xa0and in case I had questions since it was my first time at any ShakeShack. \\xa0I was quickly the next in line; however, there was a problem with the receipt or calculating the correct changes for the previous order, and I was stuck waiting for the next 10 minutes! \\xa0I was really frustrated. Since the closest touch-kiosk was within an arm's length away, I tried to sneak an order without losing my place in line. Unfortunately, when I was all ready to check out and pay, the screen flashed an error message - something about white list and out of range! After the cashier finally put in my order, I dreaded the next round of waiting upon joining the horde waiting to receive their orders. Luckily, I didn't have to wait too long -- either that, or my expectation was way too low after the infuriating ordering process. \\xa0Oh, another miss: there was only 1 ketchup pump and it was out of ketchup!So the quality of the burgers was able to make up the very negative experience and poor operation. \\xa0That speaks volume about how much we loved the ShackBurgers!\"},\n",

When my husband and I started going there the food was fantastic and we were diehard fans and we\\'d be there 2-3 times a month. It changed owners and the food was still very good (even if different) but the place didn\\'t have the same \"hang out for hours\" appeal. Those owners left and the bar itself took over the back barbecue area and were making mostly bar food and some odd (but perhaps delicious, don\\'t know) cuisine choices. Legends has a legendary smoker and it was killing us that they weren\\'t using it. A week or two ago my husband noticed a sign outside that they had the smoker going again so we decided to go last night.A breakdown of our order...1 lb. brisket - the flavor was good and it was fatty and tender like it should be. It was very thin cut though and I am of the opinion that brisket is best when it\\'s thicker. Not much of a smokey flavor and seemed to me more like roast beef than brisket.1 lb. pulled pork - I was not a fan. My husband and our friend liked it. It was cooked well and tender and juicy but lacked smokiness as well and somehow seemed watery.Note - the barbecue sauce was pretty blah. Store bought, completely generic. Pretty disappointing.Buffalo wings - FANTASTIC. I thought to myself as I was eating them that they might be some of the best I\\'ve had. And my husband and I like our buffalo wings. Very moist and saucy. I would go back just for the wings.Chips and guacamole - not sure if the guacamole was freshly made as I\\'m not an expert on guacamole. The color seemed a little less green than just-made guacamole would be but there was a lot of onion and cilantro which I love. The chips were not fresh, but I wouldn\\'t expect them to be. They were fine for what they were even though I, personally, prefer thinner crispier chips.Spinach (side) - It was fine, not worth ordering again. Nothing wrong with it though.Onion rings - Really, really good. Big and freshly fried tasting. Real onion inside (I never understand onion rings that don\\'t have an actual onion strip inside). Like the buffalo wings, also worth going back for. We will return, I\\'m sure. We like the bar and the people who own it and even though we haven\\'t been there in over a year, one of the bartenders came over to us to ask about our meal and offered us a round of free drinks.

What more could you ask for in a dining experience?! Overall dining value = priceless! :)We had just been to Japan on vacation and experienced authentic Japanese tonkatsu and this place immediately brought us back there even as we stepped through the front entrance with their plastic food display case! The place is not big but the seating is not cramped and crowded. It's clean, inviting and open. We arrived for an early dinner - around 5PM. Service was excellent and though the food didn't arrive lickety-split, it came out shortly thereafter and PIPING HOT - a sign that they cook to order. Signs on the wall ask customers to be patient because of this. Like fine wine, good deep fried tonkatsu cannot be rushed! :)While there, we saw a lot of customers come in to place carry out orders. Also there's a street-facing To-Go storefront. Party of 5 (adults). We ordered the edamame appetizer, their basic Pork Loin Cutlet Tonkatsu (Teisyoku set), their Beef and Tonkatsu Bowl (Large Aomori Gyu-Meshi Bowl) and their grilled mackerel dish (Saba Shioyaki). All were delicious. The tonkatsu was COOKED PERFECTLY. Perfectly breaded for that nice crunch factor, pork was juicy and tender and the size of each cutlet was substantial. The Bowls had the right mix of rice, tonkatsu and beef - a tasty combo. Bowl items are accompanied by a bowl of shredded cabbage and a miso soup. The cabbage dressing was delicious and refreshing (though messy when it's poured out). All the condiments and sauces are on the table (jut like in Japan!). When you're finished your meal, ask for the check, head to the counter to pay, NO TIP REQUIRED OR EVEN ENCOURAGED!, then go! So refreshing! How many times you gonna find that in NYC at a full service restaurant - or anywhere here in the US for that matter - ?!Heaven on earth!

It paired perfectly with the cabbage salad, tonkatsu sauce, miso dressing (? on counter), and the horseradish-y paste that came on the plate. Rice and miso soup were just ok. No tipping!

I am happy to tell you the wife loved the tacos al pastor, my daughter had a steak quesadilla which was huge, the tongue taco did not have a lot of taste. We wanted chicken tinga but they were out of it.The mile was a bit bitter, although it was seasoned well in my opinión it was too thick and could have benefited from being strained a bit more so it could have a smoother consistency. Clearly i can see all the spices that were added to the mole, it lacked a bit of a hint of sweetness either from peanut butter or sugar. Mole is such a sensitive sauce that if you overcook it, you can instantaneously damage the sauce. I will say this, i am staying away from mole at least the one they make here; since it lacks refinement.

Most of the food was lovely and whilst we were inside the restaurant the staff provided good service. There was only one starter that neither my husband and I enjoyed.

We were outside walking to the bus stop and my husband was saying how lovely the restaurant was and how we would definitely go back. However at that moment the waitress came outside holding the tip we had left and shouting at us, saying that we hadn't left enough of a tip--that it wasn't 15%. The last time I checked as much as tipping in the USA is common place and part of the culture; there is no obligation or legal requirement to tip any amount, never mind 15%. If the restaurant had the facility to accept card payments, we would have been able to tip a larger amount, as could have included the tip on the card payment. However by insisting on cash only it limited the amount we were able to tip. Furthermore, chasing us down the street for a larger tip is abysmal business management. The staff in this restaurant obviously do not realise that by doing this a) they are never getting our business again. b) we will tell friends and family not to provide them with business and c) it made sure that they got no tip at all. For anyone who does venture to this restaurant, you better overestimate how much cash you will need to cover meal and tip.

We ended up grabbing a lamb skewer and a squid skewer.The lamb was very juicy (mostly because it was fatty), flavoursome and well-seasoned. Some people said it was awkward eating it as it would stick to the wooden skewer but I didn't have this problem. At a dollar and some change, it was money well spent.My husband had the squid. Though I love seafood, I didn't particularly like the squid, I felt the spice mix used on it didn't work. With seafood, basic is best, it has its natural flavours from the ocean so a light sprinkle of salt and pepper with a touch of lemon would have worked wonders. In saying this, the squid itself seemed to be good quality and well cooked (squid is super easy to overcook) so they've done well in that respect.The skewers won't fill an empty stomach but if you're feeling peckish and want a snack, definitely worth the money. Even if you're not hungry, you will be after being seduced by the aromas coming from the cart ;)\",\n",

Cumin and red chili powder adds a whole depth of flavor and texture. Only complaint is probably there was a little too much fatty meat on it, and the skewer seems smaller compared to Fat Ni',\n",

And I'm fine with places that are dog friendly but this is on another level. Dogs sitting on chairs, putting their paws on the table where people have to sit and eat. I saw a dog lick a napkin. Nah bruh. People have serious deathly dog allergies. For me it feels very unsanitary unless you're wiping down each table and seats with some sorta all natural vinegar cleaning agent or a bleachy mixture. I know all the dog lovers are gonna hate me. But this is like a person putting a dog on the subway seat. Ya feel me. No. I'm cool with your support animal but they belong in a carrier or on the floor. Next thing. Had to ask for utensils...after the first round of food was on the table. Small but annoying. Now let's get to the food and drinks.I went during happy hour and had the painkiller, which reminded me of a Pina colada. Sweet and refreshing but not boozy. It was only $6. I shared a dozen $1 oysters with my friend. They were juicy, sweet and not too briny. Nice size too. Yummm! I did see this weird worm on the back of my oyster shell. Kinda freaked me out. I get it! They come from the ocean. I've sent countless oysters to their grave but never saw a worm on it. I don't have bubble guts today so I guess it's not a problem. Yay! Everything is awesomeeee.I ordered the steam pot with the added lobster. Spent $56 bucks on it. I am going to be honest and say it wasn't worth it. I've had better lobsters. I've made better lobsters. It was overcooked and not seasoned. Guess it didn't get an old Bay/salt bath. It was underwhelming but trust I ate my money's worth. Shells everywhere. Juices flying. Shells cracking. It was a glorious show. People were staring. I should've sold tickets. Lmao. The overall steam pot flavor was delicious. It was a rich red sauce, well balanced with tomatoes, tons of fresh garlic, and thyme! I could've just had that and been satisfied. But my mood was Treat Yoself YOLO! The clams were plump, juicy, and flavorful. The mussels were also succulent and sweet. The cod was bland. It had no flavor at all. I had to spoon it with the broth. The andouille was nice and spicy. There were also fingerling potatoes. You get 2 large half pieces of toasted bread to soak in the beautiful sauce and all those drippings. My friend had the Sea Wolf which is a burger, shoe string fries, a pickle, a small arugula salad and half a lobster. She thought the lobster was going to be draped across the patty but it was on the side. FYI. She loved it. If it weren't for the dog thing I could've given them a 3/4. It's a very popular spot. Outdoor and indoor seating. Gender neutral bathrooms. But I think it could've helped to have an additional person on staff. They need some stricter dog friendly rules. It was my first experience and probably my last.\",\n",

I ordered a carne asada cemita without salsa and avocado (cause I\\'m weird like that), and my father ordered costillas en salsa verde, my mother had consome. My sister and I had agua de jamaica to drink (Hibiscus tea), my mother had champurrado, a type of atole, and my father had a michelada, a mix of beer with tomato juice. As we waited for our food, I was snapping pictures of the decor that the owner brought over from Mexico as our server explained, and sang along to the Mexican pop/rock music that I so often hear in my own home. When our food arrived, the smells of the broth and papalo leaf filled the table and we said \"provecho\" and attacked. I think none of us spoke until about 10 minutes later as we were just enjoying our food that much. I had a bit of my mom\\'s lamb consome, and my father\\'s pork costillas, and they were both to die for. We left full and in a bit of a food coma.

The burrito was stuffed with meat, rice, beans and lettuce.... a typical burrito but like the tostada the meat was so salty, grilled well but hard to eat because of the high sodium. The salad on the side was very plain and did nothing for the burrito. The side sauces were a fail because they were very watery and so the lime taste was compromised. The guac in the sauce just didn't hold up to the water so it didn't even look right. I have heard great things about this place and it's always busy when I pass by.

This spot had no delivery fee and a relatively small order minimum of $15.Menu is a tad on the expensive side, yet the pictures looked pretty good. Settled on the Chicken Burrito ($10) and the Guacamole with Chips ($10). Delivery arrives in about half an hour with utensils and two kinds of hot sauces in the bag. Guacamole is both chunky and flavorful without being too aggressive on the lime juice. This went well with the thick-cut tortilla chips (not warm, but they could've lost heat). On the flip side, the burrito was a disappointment. The meat was salty and even had a few pieces of tough cartilage inside. Rice and beans didn't have too much flavor and not much cheese or sour cream to balance it out. The side salad it is served with actually turned out to be better than the entree.Feel like this spot is hit or miss depending on what you order. Probably wouldn't get the chicken again.\",\n",

The beet salad is made with canned beets (not roasted as they claim), the burritos taste as though they were pre-made and frozen a month in advance, a quesadilla that I ordered recently tasted like old fish, and the entrees are consistently a disaster.

Price: It's a little more expensive compared to traditional Chinese restaurants, but it's highly reasonable considering the amount of skills necessary to produce those tasty imitation flavors using vegetetarian ingredients. I'd say it's highly worth it!Overall, this is an awesome place for vegetarians to get tasty imitation meat and seafood dishes! I will definitely be back to try out other things on their menu!\",\n",

Their jajangmyeon is obviously good, but for lunch today I got the beef fried rice and my mom got the japchae bap.

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Is there a bigger Irish pub than Passage in Astoria? Me thinks not. From the outside looking in, the place doesn't seem all that spacious. Walk through the door and there is a whole load of craziness that includes a massive bar, a back area worthy of its own private party, and plenty of booths for groups and couples alike. Cozy, yet inviting, and with plenty of breathing room. This is the kind of joint where I'd throw a party for myself and all of my friends.One of the things they do exceptionally well, is serve some quality drinks. Since their predecessor, they've done a great job of introducing a fun line up of cocktails. I am a fan of their Passage Mule and when the weather is a bit too hot, their frozen Irish coffee is clutch with the caffeine and the brain freeze.No Irish pub is complete without a good set of taps, especially of the beer kind. They have a nice selection of beers on tap, with some craft in the mix as well. I don't mind me a pint of Guinness every so often. If I'm in the right mood (which I usually am at Passage) I'll down it all.An area that I'm really impressed with Passage in is on the food front. They have quite the beefed up (#1) menu with a number of traditional Irish items and a loaded selection of pub fare. The food gets more press than the drinks do, which is frankly no surprise. In no particular order I recommend:* Fish and Chips* Jameson Spring Rolls* Passage Burger* Guinness Mac and Cheese* Irish Stew* Sunday RoastThere is never a bad time to come here. They have a fun brunch hour on the weekends, a cool happy hour on the week days, and the staff is always accommodating. I'll surely be back often (and hungry / thirsty).___________(#1) Pun intended.\",\n",

Space so that you aren't pressed up against others and noise level was not too loud, meaning you could still hear one another and have a conversation. There's a kitchen, but I didn't try any of the food. Open late, so you can keep the night going. Recommend.\",\n",

From planning the menu (with her beautiful, bonus menu cards with my husband's face on them, wuhoo!) to the very organized flow of the party - drinks kept a'coming `cos Ursula is a superwoman), organized buffet line, frickin' fabulous food (you HAVE to get the traditional Irish stew if you're here, delicious!), gorgeous rustic, beautifully lit venue to boot - really, what more can you ask for?Their party packages are definitely worth the value, they don't scrimp on ANYTHING, and the service you will get throughout your whole party from planning to execution is top-notch. You can even play your own music if you rent the back room. Planning a party is not always easy, but this place made it super breezy!

I did not say anything because I knew he would not care.About the service, let me tell you something Eric. I have worked as a server for many years. I know that taking orders from a table of six with no background knowledge about Taiwanese brunch can be very stressful. However, it can not an excuse to treat us like trash. If you knew that we were waiting for good 10 minutes to place in our orders, you should have understand our frustration too.

I love the lu rou fan, beef roll, zhajiangmian, and pretty much everything on the menu. It is the only place I know of that serves stinky tofu within 30 mins of Manhattan. In fact, it\\'s one of three full service Taiwanese restaurants around Manhattan. The cocktails are an exciting fusion of Asian herbs and western liquor. The decor here is modern Scandinavian crossed with Brooklyn hipster.What\\'s missing is a feeling of Taiwan. Food is a HUGE part of Asian culture and it is very evident in Taiwanese daily life. From the night markets to the 7-Elevens, there is amazing food on every street corner and every block. Sadly, the only connection to Taiwan is the Chinese characters on the cans of Taiwan Beer.The restaurant opted to dumb down Taiwanese culture to make American diners comfortable instead of creating a dialog. The menu is completely in English with no Chinese while a lot of meaning is lost in the translation. What in the world is a \"nutritious sandwich\"? The waiters and waitresses completely butchered the pronunciation of \"zhajiangmian\" and warned me that the sticky tofu is stinky. (Yeah no shit, that\\'s why I want it). Am I supposed to pronounce the Chinese \"lu rou fan\" with an American accent so the wait staff can understand my order too?Dear white people: When the Asians at the table next to you order stinky tofu, please do make a disgusted face and add a snarky comment about how strange it smells. Your opinion is definitely appreciated.The missing star is for the missing soul of this restaurant.'},\n",

The restaurant has a nice outdoor seating area and a well-decorated interior as well which gives off a very \"hip\" vibe upon entry. The staff is accommodating and friendly which helps tie everything together. We\\'ve eaten dinner here before (which was great as well) but I find the Oxomoco brunch experience to be the most enjoyable. Drink wise, you really can\\'t go wrong but we really love the Spicy Mango margarita (don\\'t worry, it\\'s pretty mild) and the Smoked Strawberry. Appetizer wise, we enjoy the guacamole (which comes with large tortilla chips) but recently discovered the Chorizo Tlayuda which has a tortilla base topped with cheese, beans, salsa, and chorizo. Believe it or not, the tlayuda was not as heavy as you\\'d expect but very delicious. Lastly, we tend to order the Hamburguesa Pambazo, Bacon Burrito, or the Concha Especial. Between the three, the Hamburguesa Pambazo and Concha Especial are the best tasting and most unique in terms of flavor and presentation. The Hamburguesa Pambazo has a salsa macha that adds a nice flavor to the already juicy burger while the Concha Especial creates a wonderful sweet and savory taste by combining the pan dulce (Mexican sweet bread) with chorizo verde. Overall, I highly recommend everyone to grab brunch here ASAP and get a taste of the Oxomoco experience. Oxomoco consistently offers great food, drink, and service. We look forward to coming back again soon!',\n",

I come to Greenpoint all the time and walk past this place but never went so we thought to try it.We knew it was going to be expensive so was prepared for that. But we were really disappointed in the food quality for the price. You get two small tacos for $17. In the chicken taco the flavor was good, but I had a huge bone in mine! Good I didn't chomp down or would have lost a tooth. The steak one was very chewy. Also wasn't crazy about the tortilla used, it was too starchy tasting. And The horchata agua fresca was mostly ice. We ordered two desserts. The flan and the chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was definitely better than the flan. The cake was dense and rich, i liked the crunchies on top which added a nice texture with the creamy coffee ice cream. The flan dish was a mess though. It was a rectangle of gelatin. Totally the wrong texture, and it was swimming in a blueberry sauce. That blueberry sauce did not go with the flan or compliment it in anyway. There was supposed to be lemon on it and I tasted no lemon. I just tasted overwellming blueberry jam with gelatin. The corn crisps on the top added a crisp respite to the gelatinous dish but did not compliment it in flavor. The best thing we tried was the $4 smoked mango. My boyfriend loves smokey, spicy things and dried fruit so this was right up his alley. The mango had a nice chewy juicy texture to it and the spices were a nice combo. A bit too spicy for me but he really liked it. Also the bathrooms have disco balls in them. A very wierd experience. Not a fan. So we paid $100 for an icey drink, some dried fruit, bones in tacos, chewy steak and gelatinous dessert. We are okay with spending $40 on tacos but they better be the most amazing tacos we ever had. And they were very far from it. Skip this place and go to los tacos no. 1. Which is my favorite taco place and also coincidently Bobby Flay's pick on the show.\",\n",

We had a pre-set menu, which included coffee or cocktails, appetizers for everyone to share, an entree for everyone, and Napoleon cake. Of the appetizers, there was one dish of zucchini chips that were to die for - and they weren't fried, so I went to town! I ordered the grilled chicken salad, which was enough to take home, but it wasn't something I particularly enjoyed. The chicken was great and plentiful, but the salad part was super greasy. Other people got entrees like the omelette and French toast, which they seemed to enjoy. I really liked the coffee with their almond milk!The service was very professional and attentive. Whatever we needed, they were quick to provide. Thy handled the big party well.

Cheap and good usually don't go hand and hand in 2019 especially in any of the boroughs but this place pulls it off. The food was good and the prices were low. Steak Burrito: 3/5, this thing was big enough to cure world hunger, and it tasted pretty good. Unfortunately it was probably 60% rice, but I really can't complain for the price. If there was less rice even if it made sacrificing the size of he Burrito I'd say it'd be better.Chicken Quesadilla: 3/5, alittle bland. Some sauce would've made a world of difference. Nothing to write home about but not bad either.Chips: 4/5, the chips were very good and they give you a full takeout box full. The guac wasn't great though. Needed some more flavor.Overall, I appreciate low cost food without really taking a hit on quality. I really don't want to complain much because the food was good, but it just wasn't anything special and I wouldn't travel out of my way to come back.

       "  'Positive Review 1': 'Great location in Forest Hills right by the other trendy restaurants and, more importantly, delicious food!Came here recently with my wife and a friend on a random Tuesday evening at around 6pm and, since it was a really nice night, the area was already bustling. However, surprisingly Bangkok Cuisine was the one quiet restaurant, with the exception of a few customers. With that said, don\\'t be deterred by the lack of a crowd as it probably has more to do with the fact that they have no outdoor seating unlike the rest of the trendier-looking restaurants on the block.We scored a table by the window and were immediately served by a waitress. Since our friend was the real expert, with multiple trips to the restaurant we left the ordering to her. To be honest, everything sounded good from the menu, but since we were just 3 people, we kept our ordering to a \"modest\" 4 dishes. Here\\'s a quick few thoughts on them:Thai Style Pork BBQ Skewers - The marinated pork skewers were ridiculously delicious and the perfect appetizer. In fact, I could have ordered 3 of these and called it a day. That\\'s how good they were. The skewers were dripping with flavor, very tender and really didn\\'t even need the sweet & spicy dipping sauce on the side. The restaurant could have dropped the mic right there.Chicken Yellow Curry with Thai Roti (served with house salad & steamed rice) - Another excellent dish. The delicious curry had a bit of a kick to it, but there was plenty of chicken to douse the curry with. In addition, there was a small side of steamed rice, so it made for an actually hearty entree.Old Fashion Pad Thai (Chicken) - Solid Pad Thai. It was tasty and, oddly, it was served with sort of an omelette on top, but it worked. I can\\'t say it was any different than most Pad Thai\\'s I\\'ve tried in my life, except for the egg-like cover on top.Kao-Obb BKK (special Thai fried rice with shrimp, chicken, scallops & Thai sausage) - Loved everything about this fried rice and its flavors, but I could have used a bit more shrimp and scallops. It seemed more like pieces of fried chicken served with fried rice with a few slices of Thai sausage mixed in. Anyhow, I loved the small pieces of fried chicken and the few slices of Thai sausage were excellent.In addition to the 4 dishes we ordered, we also ordered Thai Iced Teas, but I had to be \"special\" and order the Mango Thai Iced Tea, which I ended up regretting. Not that it was terrible, but there was no milk in it, so it wasn\\'t the best Thai Iced Tea I had. My word of advice, go with the regular Thai Iced Tea if you\\'re thirsty.Service throughout our meal was great. The waitress was cordial and quick to our table to take our food and drink orders and the food arrived right on time when we expected them. Plus, she also came by to re-fill our waters whenever they went empty. Couldn\\'t really ask for a better experience at a local restaurant. Definitely a winner among the many restaurants in the Forest Hills neighborhood.',\n",

I opted for the salad, spring rolls, and chicken pad see ew and my mom went the same but chose the shrimp pad thai instead of the pad see ew.Order:- Spring rolls (4/5) ~ Came out quickly and was hot and crispy. Was served with a sweet chili sauce- Salad (4/5) ~ Simple salad with lettuce, and carrots with a dressing that tasted like it had peanuts in it- Chicken Pad See Ew (4/5) ~ Gave a lot of chicken- Shrimp Pad Thai (3/5) ~ Tasted very sweet, but with hot sauce it tasted a lot betterPros:- Tasty Thai food with a variety of food and drinks (they have a full bar)- Clean and nicely designed restaurant - Good and quick service - Great location ~ close to the Forest Hills subway station - Cheap ~ about $10-12 for the lunch special depending on what protein you get - Large portions (especially for a lunch special)Cons:- Small restaurant ~ not ideal for large groups - Pad Thai could have been better.

I was very impressed at how much patience and care they had for the seniors! They made it possible to fit a resident in a wheelchair as well as 8 people with walkers into there busy establishment. I called a few days before and spoke to the manger Carlos, who did his absolute best to accommodate us. Our waitress ( I forgot her name) did not get frustrated or annoyed by us at all! She made sure we were ok and had everything we needed! The residents could not stop talking about how great the service was!\",\n",

The staff is super nice and accommodating to your preferences. The food comes out all at once and it was pretty quick too. I only wish that they were open 24/7.I like most of the items on their menu.- If you order coffee, they leave a kettle on your table for refills. - They have great hash browns which have a nice crisp on the outside and they give plenty.- Not really a fan of their sausages.- Also not a fan of their scrambled eggs. Pretty sure it's from a carton- The burger was surprisingly much better than I expected. The bun was soft and the patty was juicy. I couldn't decide which burger I wanted either because they all sounded good so I'm sure all of their options would have been good!- The country fried steak was was really good. It came with so many sides - eggs, hash browns and another side which I chose pancakes. - The biscuit with gravy was good as well and came with sausages, eggs, and hash browns. The biscuit was soft and buttery.- Always recommend their pancakes! I love the plain buttermilk pancakes which are not plain at all and super delicious with the original syrup. Although I indulged in such heavy foods which probably had tons of sugar as well, I did enjoy it and would recommend this IHOP. The service was really great and the food was good.\",\n",

Settled on the German Omelette w/ Pancakes ($11.25) and a regular drip coffee ($1). Omelette is stuffed with a large helping of peppers, onions, bacon pieces, and potatoes - very filling and a good blend of ingredients. The short stack of three pancakes tasted fresh as they are super fluffy and served with some butter. Simple meal that was the perfect amount of food for breakfast.While our waitress was certainly friendly, it took a while for her to come around (busy day) and forgot one of the drink orders (not on the bill thankfully).

Another good dish is the taco salad. Very flavorful, albeit kinda small. The chicken taquito is another good dish. It's a good appetizer for sharing. Not too oily and it comes in six pieces. They have these sauces on the table, a green and red sauce that you can put on your food for more flavor. Surprisingly, the green sauce is terrible. No taste and very watery.

I was very upset and confused to why I needed to change my address when I just received the incorrect order. Which means you have my address and you received my payment to send my order to this address. I contacted seamless and I was refunded though them. Now I'm stuck drinking this juice that has way too much lemon in it smh. Thanks Rego Bagel Aka Bagel Creations & More.\"},\n",

If you're looking for really nice coffee in the ridgewood area, go here! will be definitely coming here soon, actually probably later today\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Rudy's is on the way to my gym...so naturally I'm in here on the regular. They have so many delicious treats in here. My favorites include the tiramisu cup, the fruit danishes, and the walnut ring. I also love their milk chocolate covered pretzels. The pretzels are the perfect balance of sweet and salty. They sell them by the pound, but they also let me just purchase one or two when I want a small treat. They also have gelato, breakfast sandwiches, and coffee.I also recently went to Rudy's because I needed a custom cake for my mom's 60th birthday. I wanted something special and their staff helped me come up with a lovely concept. The cake had frosting roses, gold trim, and pudding inside. It looked pretty and it was also so delicious. My mom loved it. The staff here is so friendly and funny. I loved supporting this great bakery in my neighborhood.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 2': \"I gotta say I'm very disappointed after coming here since I was a child, I've learned from a very reliable source that almost all of the pastries there aren't even made there, they're delivered from other bakeries.they just make a handful of cakes. The canolie cream comes from a package. Yet they have the audacity to charge these very expensive prices. Last time I was there I bought a couple of chocolate Graham cookies and a strudel(that tasted stale) and it almost ran me close to \\xa020 bucks. If I ever pay that much again I'll make sure they're made fresh and on premises.\",\n",
       "  'Negative Review 3': \"Rude, terrible customer service. My mom placed an order here from out of state, to get delivered to me in Astoria which is a ways away from this store. She paid for a red velvet cake thru Caviar, but I never got the order. When I called them to ask what was up, the manager wouldn't even come to the phone- he just kept barking stuff to his employee to tell me. Basically saying that they never got any order, even though she paid, and he didn't even have the courtesy to come to the phone to rip us off! DO NOT DO BUSINESS WITH THESE PEOPLE.\"},\n",

They lose a star because although I've been back a few times their credit card machine always seems to be out of order despite me calling and asking them if it was working. But alas the amazing food makes up for it. It might not be the most authentic but their food is delicious, no one can deny that. Ordering from Woke is great either as carry out or dine in (though you will see fine in options give bigger portions). I tend to order a lot of chicken lo-mein and i adore this place. Can't wait to go back. The staff is extra friendly they greet you as you walk in and as you leave. They provide complementary pots of tea on each table and are extremely fast in their service. The duck soup actually tastes fantastic the duck is so tender and juicy. I even writing about it I'm craving it, guess I'm going back tonight.\",\n",

I admit, this was my first time coming here so I can't speak on consistency just yet but I'm already a fan and plan to return. It's located across the street from 7-11 and right next to the Dunkin' Donuts next door. I ordered the beef pan-fried noodles. The portions are massive and yes.. I ate it all! You can always order family style and share amongst the table (my personal favorite way of eating) but to each their own. In the words of my favorite bodybuilder, actor, and former politician.. I'll be back.\",\n",

       "  'Positive Review 1': \"Numerous changes have lead me to believe they're doing better than ever.* They run the buffet 7 days a week and till 4:30pm. That's probably their bread and butter but not many Indian places can afford to do so.* Overhaul of the staff. Phone manners are better. Just nicer people in general and they're actually protective of the buffet. Patrons aren't just coming up with their dirty plates without being met by someone.* Naan is no longer being served on the buffet. Instead it's being served fresh table side. * Pitchers of water are chilled and filled with ice. Goodbye room temperature stale water.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 2': \"Jackson Diner still holds the distinction of having the funkiest decor of all of the Indian AYCE buffets in Jackson Heights and is easily the biggest tourist trap for all of the non-locals who aren't willing to venture too far from 74th Street. \\xa0That said, Jackson Diner could be used as a benchmark for the inhibited, non-savy, yet curious Indian foodies only now they have to cough up $10.95 for the lunch buffet. \\xa0The secret for Jackson Diner is their ability to place the food in front of the large window for all hungry pedestrians looking from the outside. \\xa0Delhi Palace, Indian Taj, and Ashoka (before they closed) all had their food covered or placed in the back. \\xa0Of all of the other popular restaurants, Jackson Diner still doesn't take credit card while nearby Taj and Delhi Palace will gladly take it for a minimum of $10 or more. \\xa0Not to hate on them too much, the food is relatively decent and the selection is good. \\xa0Waiting for Dosas can really jam the line up and the crowds are still too fierce on the weekends. \\xa0Chicken Mehkni and Sag Paneer are rich and full of flavor, while the Aloo Tikki, Khadi Pakoras, and Chana Aloo still leave for much to be desired.And of course, the service still and may always suck.\",\n",
       "  'Positive Review 3': \"For the non-savy, this place would sound like a regular diner, perhaps stereotypically owned by a Greek person given that its in Queens. \\xa0But instead, its one of the most popular Indian spots, right smack dab in the heart of Little India of Jackson Heights. \\xa0With some seriously funky decor, it is reminscent of a cafeteria turned Indian establishment. \\xa0For about $10, the weekend buffet is a treat as the butter chicken, palak paneer, and goat curries are sensational, while the tandoori, samosas, and chana aloo are a bit dry. \\xa0So far as I've sampled, the desserts (mostly rice pudding) have been lacking variety if not taste. \\xa0 I have ordered rasmali on several occasions to find that it is excellent (but for $5 bucks?).Service has gone downhill here, especially since the place has become so popular during weekend afternoons and nights. \\xa0I have considered their delivery on several occasions, but their area has recently been reduced to only a few blocks outside of the Jackson Heights area. \\xa0Beware, this place is cash only.\",\n",

       "  'Negative Review 3': \"Mediocre food at low prices. Indifferent service at best. The large room is often understandably empty, and it's sometimes easier to bus your own table than to induce a waiter to do so. Simply move dirty dishes onto one of the many empty tables that surround you in this vast depressing room. If you run out of naan, ask for it if a waiter walks by. Otherwise it will not be replaced. \\xa0The atmosphere is funereal. The welcome one expects on arrival is ironically reserved for departure. I think the kitchen does the best one can expect for the price, but there's a sad, pointless inadequacy on the part of management.\"},\n",

It's crispy, fluffy, cheesy and with a perfect place of herbs and spices. Plus everybody is super nice in the pizzeria and best of all there are cheap.

My typical experience dining in at a pizza place is that the guys working behind the counter aren't that friendly, may talk down to me because I'm a woman by myself, may hit on me, etc. These guys were 100% wholesome polite folks who delivered nothing but the best service. I have never seen such good customer service in a little pizza shop! The food of course was great, too. I have not tried their slices, but their entrees and appetizers are very tasty.\",\n",
